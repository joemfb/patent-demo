<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The application is based on Japanese patent application No. 2009-106389, the content of which is incorporated hereinto by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device in which an air gap is provided between an interconnect and an insulating film having the interconnect provided therein and a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the reduction in the size of semiconductor devices, the gap between interconnects has been reduced. When the gap between the interconnects is reduced, the capacitance between the interconnects is increased, which causes a signal delay. As an example of a technique for reducing the capacitance between the interconnects, an air gap is provided between the interconnect and an insulating film having the interconnect provided therein.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Published patent application NO. 2008/0076258 discloses a structure in which, when a groove in which an interconnect is provided is formed in an insulating film, a damaged layer is formed on the side wall of the groove and the damaged layer is removed after the interconnect is formed, thereby forming an air gap between the interconnect and the insulating film.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Japanese Unexamined patent publication NO. 2008-300652 discloses a structure in which a catalytic characteristic film is formed on the bottom and the side of a groove in which an interconnect is provided, a Cu film, serving as the interconnect, is formed on the catalytic characteristic film, and the catalytic characteristic film on the side of the groove is removed, thereby forming an air gap between the interconnect and the insulating film.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Japanese Unexamined patent publication NO. 2008-205458 discloses a structure in which a metal cap is formed over an interconnect, the surface of an insulating film having the interconnect provided therein is damaged, and the damaged surface is removed, which is not a technique for forming an air gap.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present inventor has recognized as follows. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, when a via <b>421</b> and an interconnect groove <b>422</b> are formed in an interconnect layer <b>420</b> that is provided on an interconnect layer <b>400</b> having an air gap <b>402</b> formed therein, positional deviation between the via <b>421</b> and the interconnect <b>404</b> of the interconnect layer <b>400</b> occurs. An opening region <b>424</b> that is connected to an upper part of the air gap <b>402</b> is formed on the bottom of the via <b>421</b> according to the degree of positional deviation. In the structure in which the opening region <b>424</b> is formed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>, when a diffusion barrier metal film <b>430</b> and a seed film <b>432</b> are formed in the via <b>421</b> and the interconnect groove <b>422</b>, the diffusion barrier metal film <b>430</b> and the seed film <b>432</b> are not formed in and around the opening region <b>424</b>. As a result, a void <b>426</b> is formed in an interconnect <b>434</b>. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent a region that is connected to the air gap <b>402</b> from being formed on the bottom of the via <b>421</b> even when positional deviation between the interconnect <b>404</b> and the via <b>421</b> occurs.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment of the invention, there is provided a semiconductor device including: a first insulating layer; interconnects that are provided in the first insulating layer and has an upper surface which is higher than an upper surface of the first insulating layer; air gaps that are provided between the interconnects and the first insulating layer; a second insulating layer that is formed at least over the first insulating layer and the air gaps; an etching stopper film that is formed at least over the second insulating layer; a third insulating layer that is formed over the etching stopper film; and vias that are provided at least in the third insulating layer and are connected to the interconnects.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">When the via is formed in the third insulating layer, the third insulating layer is etched to form a connection hole and the etching stopper film disposed on the bottom of the connection hole is etched. In the above-mentioned embodiment, the upper surface of the interconnect is higher than the upper surface of the first insulating layer. Therefore, the upper surface of the interconnect is higher than the upper end of the air gap, and the etching stopper film is separated from the air gap in the thickness direction. The second insulating layer is disposed between the etching stopper film and the air gap. Therefore, even though positional deviation between the via and the interconnect occurs when the connection hole, serving as the via, is formed in the third insulating layer and the connection hole overlaps the air gap in a plan view, the second insulating layer serves as an etching stopper when the etching stopper film disposed on the bottom of the connection hole is removed. As a result, it is possible to prevent the connection between the air gap and the connection hole.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment of the invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device. The method includes: forming a first insulating layer; forming grooves in the first insulating layer; forming interconnects in the grooves; forming spaces between the first insulating layer and the interconnects and disposing an upper surface of the interconnect at a position higher than an upper surface of the first insulating layer; forming air gaps in the spaces and forming a second insulating layer at least over the first insulating layer and the interconnects; forming an etching stopper film at least over the second insulating layer; forming a third insulating layer over the etching stopper film; and forming vias at least in the third insulating layer so as to be disposed over the interconnects.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the above-mentioned embodiments of the invention, it is possible to prevent connection between an air gap and a via even though positional deviation between the via and an interconnect occurs when a connection hole, serving as the via, is formed in the third insulating layer.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating the structure of a semiconductor device according to a first embodiment of the invention. The semiconductor device includes a first insulating layer <b>120</b>, interconnects <b>162</b>, air gaps <b>128</b>, a second insulating layer <b>200</b>, an etching stopper film <b>210</b>, a third insulating layer <b>220</b>, and a via <b>262</b>. The interconnects <b>162</b> are provided in the first insulating layer <b>120</b>, and the upper surface of the interconnect <b>162</b> is higher than the upper surface of the first insulating layer <b>120</b>. The air gap <b>128</b> is disposed between the interconnect <b>162</b> and the first insulating layer <b>120</b>. The second insulating layer <b>200</b> is formed at least on the first insulating layer <b>120</b> and the air gaps <b>128</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the second insulating layer <b>200</b> does not cover the interconnect <b>162</b>. The etching stopper film <b>210</b> is formed at least on the second insulating layer <b>200</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the etching stopper film <b>210</b> is formed on the second insulating layer <b>200</b> and the interconnect <b>162</b>. The third insulating layer <b>220</b> is formed on the etching stopper film <b>210</b>. The via <b>262</b> is provided in the third insulating layer <b>220</b> and is connected to the interconnect <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a portion of the second insulating layer <b>200</b> is buried between the interconnect <b>162</b> and the first insulating layer <b>120</b>. The air gap <b>128</b> is formed in the second insulating layer <b>200</b> that is disposed between the interconnect <b>162</b> and the first insulating layer <b>120</b>. However, unlike the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the second insulating layer <b>200</b> may not be buried between the interconnect <b>162</b> and the first insulating layer <b>120</b>, but the second insulating layer <b>200</b> may be formed so as to cover the space between the interconnect <b>162</b> and the first insulating layer <b>120</b>, thereby forming the air gap <b>128</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it is considered that this structure is likely to be actually formed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The interconnect <b>162</b> is provided in a groove <b>122</b> that is formed in the first insulating layer <b>120</b>, and the via <b>262</b> is provided in a connection hole <b>221</b> that is formed in the third insulating layer <b>220</b>. A groove <b>222</b> is formed in the third insulating layer <b>220</b> so as to be disposed over the connection hole <b>221</b>. An interconnect <b>264</b> that is connected to the via <b>262</b> is provided in the groove <b>222</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the via <b>262</b> and the interconnect <b>264</b> are formed by the same process.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The interconnect <b>162</b>, the via <b>262</b>, and the interconnect <b>264</b> are formed by a plating method. Specifically, the interconnect <b>162</b> includes a seed film <b>161</b>. A diffusion barrier metal film <b>160</b> is formed between the seed film <b>161</b> and the groove <b>122</b>. Similarly, the via <b>262</b> and the interconnect <b>264</b> include a seed film <b>261</b>. A diffusion barrier metal film <b>260</b> is formed between the groove <b>222</b> and the connection hole <b>221</b>, and the seed film <b>261</b>. The interconnect <b>162</b>, the via <b>262</b>, and the interconnect <b>264</b> are, for example, Cu films. Each of the diffusion barrier metal films <b>160</b> and <b>260</b> is, for example, a multi-layer film of a TaN film and a Ta film laminated in this order.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first insulating layer <b>120</b>, the second insulating layer <b>200</b>, and the third insulating layer <b>220</b> are low-dielectric-constant films. For example, each of the first insulating layer <b>120</b>, the second insulating layer <b>200</b>, and the third insulating layer <b>220</b> is a SiCOH film, a SiCOHN film, or a porous film thereof and has a relative dielectric constant of equal to or less than 3.5, preferably, equal to or less than 2.7. The first insulating layer <b>120</b> is formed on an etching stopper film <b>100</b>. The etching stopper film <b>100</b> is formed on an underlying insulating film <b>10</b>. For example, the underlying insulating film <b>10</b> is an insulating film forming an interconnect layer that is provided below the interconnect <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 6B</figref> are cross-sectional views illustrating a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the method of manufacturing the semiconductor device, first, the first insulating layer <b>120</b> is formed. Then, the groove <b>122</b> is formed in the first insulating layer <b>120</b>. Then, the interconnect <b>162</b> is provided in the groove <b>122</b>. Then, a space is formed between the first insulating layer <b>120</b> and the interconnect <b>162</b> and the upper surface of the interconnect <b>162</b> is disposed at a position higher than the upper surface of the first insulating layer <b>120</b>. Then, the space is filled up with an insulator to form the air gap <b>128</b> and the second insulating layer <b>200</b> is formed on the first insulating layer <b>120</b> and the interconnect <b>162</b>. Then, the etching stopper film <b>210</b> is formed on the second insulating layer <b>200</b>, and the third insulating layer <b>220</b> is formed on the etching stopper film <b>210</b>. Then, the via <b>262</b> that is disposed over the interconnect <b>162</b> is formed in the third insulating layer <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Next, the manufacturing method will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the etching stopper film <b>100</b> is formed on the underlying insulating film <b>10</b>. The etching stopper film <b>100</b> is, for example, a SiCN film or a SiCNH film. However, the etching stopper film <b>100</b> may be a SiN film, a SiNH film, or a SiCOH film. The carbon concentration of the SiCOH film is higher than that of a SiCOH film forming the first insulating layer <b>120</b>. For example, the carbon concentration is equal to or more than 20 at % and equal to or less than 45 at %. Then, the first insulating layer <b>120</b> and a silicon oxide layer <b>140</b> are formed on the etching stopper film <b>100</b>. Then, an antireflection film <b>150</b> is formed on the silicon oxide layer <b>140</b>. Then, a photo resist film <b>50</b> is formed on the antireflection film <b>150</b>, and the photo resist film <b>50</b> is exposed and developed to form an opening pattern in the photo resist film <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, dry etching is performed on the antireflection film <b>150</b>, the silicon oxide layer <b>140</b>, and the first insulating layer <b>120</b> using the photo resist film <b>50</b> as a mask. A fluorocarbon gas is used as the etching gas. In this way, the groove <b>122</b> is formed in the first insulating layer <b>120</b>. Then, the photo resist film <b>50</b> and the antireflection film <b>150</b> are removed by plasma ashing using gas including oxygen.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the etching stopper film <b>100</b> disposed on the bottom of the groove <b>122</b> is removed by dry etching. In this process, a portion of the silicon oxide layer <b>140</b> is removed. Then, the groove <b>122</b> is cleaned by a stripper for a photo resist film. The stripper is an amine-based solution.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a first damaged layer <b>124</b> is formed on the first insulating layer <b>120</b> that is disposed on the side wall of the groove <b>122</b>. The first damaged layer <b>124</b> is a low carbon layer generated by a reduction in the carbon concentration of the first insulating layer <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the diffusion barrier metal film <b>160</b> and the interconnect <b>162</b> are provided in the groove <b>122</b>. The details of this process are as follows. First, the diffusion barrier metal film <b>160</b> is formed on the bottom and the side wall of the groove <b>122</b> and on the silicon oxide layer <b>140</b> by, for example, a sputtering method. Then, the seed film <b>161</b> is formed on the diffusion barrier metal film <b>160</b> by, for example, a sputtering method. Then, plating is performed using the seed film <b>161</b> as a seed to form a conductive film. Then, the conductive film disposed on the silicon oxide layer <b>140</b>, the seed film <b>161</b>, the diffusion barrier metal film <b>160</b>, and the silicon oxide layer <b>140</b> are removed by a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) method. In this state, the surface of the first insulating layer <b>120</b> is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a second damaged layer <b>126</b> is formed on the surface of the first insulating layer <b>120</b>. The second damaged layer <b>126</b> is a low carbon layer generated by a reduction in the carbon concentration of the first insulating layer <b>120</b> and is formed by, for example, processing the surface of the first insulating layer <b>120</b> with plasma including hydrogen. In this case, for example, an ammonia gas is used as at least a portion of the plasma gas.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the first damaged layer <b>124</b> and the second damaged layer <b>126</b> are removed by wet etching. For example, a dilute hydrofluoric acid (DHF) is used as an etchant. A space <b>125</b> disposed between the interconnect <b>162</b> and the first insulating layer <b>120</b> is formed in the first insulating layer <b>120</b> by the above-mentioned process. In addition, the upper surface of the interconnect <b>162</b> is higher than the upper surface of the first insulating layer <b>120</b>. The first damaged layer <b>124</b> and the second damaged layer <b>126</b> may be removed by dry etching.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the second insulating layer <b>200</b> is formed on the first insulating layer <b>120</b>, the space <b>125</b>, and the interconnect <b>162</b>. The second insulating layer <b>200</b> is formed by, for example, a plasma CVD method. In this state, the upper surface of a portion of the second insulating layer <b>200</b> that is disposed on the first insulating layer <b>120</b> is higher than the upper surface of the interconnect <b>162</b>. The air gap <b>128</b> is formed in the space <b>125</b> by this process. A portion of the second insulating layer <b>200</b> gets into the space <b>125</b>. However, the second insulating layer <b>200</b> may not get into the space <b>125</b> according to the conditions for forming the second insulating layer <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the outer layer of the second insulating layer <b>200</b> is polished and removed by a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) method. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, since the second insulating layer <b>200</b> disposed on the interconnect <b>162</b> is removed, the interconnect <b>162</b> is exposed from the second insulating layer <b>200</b>. However, the second insulating layer <b>200</b> remains on the air gap <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the etching stopper film <b>210</b> is formed on the second insulating layer <b>200</b> and the interconnects <b>162</b>. The etching stopper film <b>210</b> is, for example, a SiCN film and is formed by, for example, a plasma CVD method. Then, the third insulating layer <b>220</b> is formed on the etching stopper film <b>210</b> by, for example, a plasma CVD method. The third insulating layer <b>220</b> is, for example, a SiCOH film.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, a silicon oxide layer <b>240</b> is formed on the third insulating layer <b>220</b> by, for example, a plasma CVD method. Then, the connection hole <b>221</b> and the groove <b>222</b> are formed in the third insulating layer <b>220</b> by, for example, a dual damascene method. The connection hole <b>221</b> is disposed over the interconnect <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When etching is performed to form the connection hole <b>221</b>, first, the third insulating layer <b>220</b> is etched using the etching stopper film <b>210</b> as a stopper. In this way, the connection hole <b>221</b> is formed in the third insulating layer <b>220</b>, but the etching stopper film <b>210</b> remains on the bottom of the connection hole <b>221</b>. Then, the etching stopper film <b>210</b> remaining on the bottom of the connection hole <b>221</b> is removed by etching.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this process, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, positional deviation between the connection hole <b>221</b> and the interconnect <b>162</b> occurs, which causes the connection hole <b>221</b> to overlap the air gap <b>128</b>, when seen in a plan view. However, in this embodiment, the second insulating layer <b>200</b> is disposed between the air gap <b>128</b> and the etching stopper film <b>210</b>. Therefore, when the etching stopper film <b>210</b> disposed on the bottom of the connection hole <b>221</b> is removed, the second insulating layer <b>200</b> serves as an etching stopper, and the connection between the air gap <b>128</b> and the connection hole <b>221</b> is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the diffusion barrier metal film <b>260</b> and the via <b>262</b> are provided in the connection hole <b>221</b>, and the diffusion barrier metal film <b>260</b> and the interconnect <b>264</b> are provided in the groove <b>222</b>. The details of this process are as follows. First, the diffusion barrier metal film <b>260</b> is formed on the bottom and the side wall of the connection hole <b>221</b> and the groove <b>222</b> and on the silicon oxide layer <b>240</b> (for example, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>) by, for example, a sputtering method. Then, the seed film <b>261</b> is formed on the diffusion barrier metal film <b>260</b> by, for example, a sputtering method. Then, plating is performed using the seed film <b>261</b> as a seed to form a conductive film. Then, the conductive film on the silicon oxide layer <b>240</b>, the seed film <b>261</b>, the diffusion barrier metal film <b>260</b>, and the silicon oxide layer <b>240</b> are removed by a CMP method.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Next, the operation and effects of this embodiment will be described. According to this embodiment, before the second insulating layer <b>200</b> is formed, the upper surface of the interconnect <b>162</b> is disposed at a position higher than the upper surface of the first insulating layer <b>120</b>. Therefore, even when the outer layer of the second insulating layer <b>200</b> is polished and removed by a CMP method, a portion of the second insulating layer <b>200</b> remains on the air gap <b>128</b>. Therefore, even when positional deviation between the connection hole <b>221</b> and the interconnect <b>162</b> occurs and the connection hole <b>221</b> overlaps the air gap <b>128</b> in a plan view, the second insulating layer <b>200</b> serves as an etching stopper when the etching stopper film <b>210</b> disposed on the bottom of the connection hole <b>221</b> is removed, and the connection between the air gap <b>128</b> and the connection hole <b>221</b> is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Therefore, it is possible to prevent the generation of a region in which the diffusion barrier metal film <b>260</b> and the seed film <b>261</b> are not formed in the side wall and the bottom of the connection hole <b>221</b>. As a result, it is possible to prevent a void from being formed in the via <b>262</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In this embodiment, since the air gap <b>128</b> is formed by the second insulating layer <b>200</b>, it is not necessary to form another film in order to form the air gap <b>128</b>. Therefore, it is possible to prevent an increase in the number of processes for manufacturing a semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The second damaged layer <b>126</b> is formed on the upper surface of the first insulating layer <b>120</b>, and the second damaged layer <b>126</b> is removed such that the upper surface of the interconnect <b>162</b> is higher than the upper surface of the first insulating layer <b>120</b>. The removal of the second damaged layer <b>126</b> is performed by the same process as that for removing the first damaged layer <b>124</b> and forming the space <b>125</b> for forming the air gap <b>128</b>. Therefore, it is possible to prevent an increase in the number of processes for manufacturing a semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The first insulating layer <b>120</b> is processed by plasma including hydrogen to form the second damaged layer <b>126</b>. Therefore, when the second damaged layer <b>126</b> is formed, it is possible to prevent a damaged layer, for example, an oxide layer from being formed on the surface of the interconnect <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The second insulating layer <b>200</b> with a low dielectric constant is arranged in the space formed by reducing the upper surface of the first insulating layer <b>120</b> to be lower than the upper surface of the interconnect <b>162</b>, that is, a space between the upper parts of the interconnects <b>162</b>. Therefore, it is possible to prevent an increase in capacitance between the interconnects <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(Second Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating the structure of a semiconductor device according to a second embodiment of the invention. The semiconductor device has the same structure as that according to the first embodiment except for the following points. First, the underlying insulating film <b>10</b> is an insulating film in which a via connected to the interconnect <b>162</b> is formed. Therefore, the etching stopper film <b>100</b> according to the first embodiment is not formed between the underlying insulating film <b>10</b> and the first insulating layer <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The third insulating layer <b>220</b> includes an insulating interlayer <b>224</b> and an interconnect layer insulating layer <b>226</b>. The via <b>262</b> is provided in the insulating interlayer <b>224</b>, and the interconnect <b>264</b> is provided in the interconnect layer insulating layer <b>226</b>. An air gap <b>302</b> is formed between the interconnect <b>264</b> and the interconnect layer insulating layer <b>226</b>, and an insulating layer <b>300</b> and an etching stopper film <b>310</b> are formed on the interconnect layer insulating layer <b>226</b>. The air gap <b>302</b> is formed by the insulating layer <b>300</b>. A method of forming the air gap <b>302</b>, the insulating layer <b>300</b>, and the etching stopper film <b>310</b> is the same as that forming the air gap <b>128</b>, the second insulating layer <b>200</b>, and the etching stopper film <b>210</b>. The upper surface of the interconnect layer insulating layer <b>226</b> is lower than the upper surface of the interconnect <b>264</b>. A method of reducing the upper surface of the interconnect layer insulating layer <b>226</b> to be lower than the upper surface of the interconnect <b>264</b> is the same as that of reducing the upper surface of the first insulating layer <b>120</b> to be lower than the upper surface of the interconnect <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In this embodiment, it is also possible to obtain the same effects as those in the first embodiment. In addition, since the air gap <b>302</b> is also formed between the interconnect <b>264</b> and the interconnect layer insulating layer <b>226</b>, it is possible to reduce capacitance between the interconnects that are arranged in the same layer as that in which the interconnect <b>264</b> is arranged.</p>

A method of forming the components is the same as that in the first embodiment. However, in this embodiment, the diffusion barrier metal film <b>260</b> is not a multi-layer film of a TaN film and a Ta film laminated in this order, but it may be, for example, a SiCH film.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to this embodiment, it is also possible to obtain the same effects as those in the first embodiment. Since the second insulating layer <b>200</b> is formed after the metal cap film <b>164</b> is formed on the interconnect <b>162</b>, a portion of the second insulating layer <b>200</b> that is disposed over the air gap <b>128</b> is thicker than that according to the first embodiment. Therefore, even when the connection hole <b>221</b> overlaps the air gap <b>128</b> in a plan view, it is possible to prevent the connection between the air gap <b>128</b> and the connection hole <b>221</b> when the etching stopper film <b>210</b> disposed on the bottom of the connection hole <b>221</b> is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Since the metal cap film <b>164</b> is formed on the interconnect <b>162</b>, the electromigration resistance of the interconnect <b>162</b> is improved. In addition, since the metal cap film <b>164</b> also serves as a diffusion barrier metal film of the interconnect <b>162</b>, it is possible to use a SiCH film with a low dielectric constant as the diffusion barrier metal film <b>260</b>.</p>

That is, in the semiconductor device manufactured in this embodiment, the upper surface of the interconnect <b>162</b> is covered with the second insulating layer <b>200</b> and a lower part of the via <b>262</b> is provided in the second insulating layer <b>200</b>, which will be described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, the etching stopper film <b>100</b>, the first insulating layer <b>120</b>, the grooves <b>122</b>, the diffusion barrier metal film <b>160</b>, the seed film <b>161</b>, the interconnects <b>162</b>, the spaces <b>125</b>, the air gaps <b>128</b>, and the second insulating layer <b>200</b> are formed on the underlying insulating film <b>10</b>.

A method of making the upper surface of the interconnect <b>162</b> higher than the upper surface of the first insulating layer <b>120</b> is the same as that in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, the outer layer of the second insulating layer <b>200</b> is polished and removed by a CMP method.

The thickness of the second insulating layer <b>200</b> disposed on the interconnect <b>162</b> is, for example, equal to or more than 5 nm and equal to or less than 50 nm, which is smaller than that of the third insulating layer <b>220</b>.</p>

A method of forming the components is the same as that in the first embodiment except that, in a process of forming the connection hole <b>221</b>, after the etching stopper film <b>210</b> is etched, the second insulating layer <b>200</b> is etched to dispose the bottom of the connection hole <b>221</b> in the second insulating layer <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In this embodiment, when the etching stopper film <b>210</b> disposed on the bottom of the connection hole <b>221</b> is removed, the second insulating layer <b>200</b> serves as an etching stopper.

The upper surface of the interconnect <b>162</b> is higher than the upper surface of the first insulating layer <b>120</b>. Therefore, a portion of the second insulating layer <b>200</b> that is disposed over the air gap <b>128</b> is thicker than another portion that is disposed over the interconnect <b>162</b>.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In addition, since the second insulating layer <b>200</b> remains on the interconnect <b>162</b>, it is not necessary to consider selectivity between the interconnect <b>162</b> and the second insulating layer <b>200</b> in the process of removing the outer layer of the second insulating layer <b>200</b> using a CMP method.</p>
