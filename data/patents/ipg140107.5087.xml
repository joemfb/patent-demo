<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of cellular communication systems, and more particularly, to the femtocells base stations operable within cellular communication networks.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Prior to setting forth the background of the invention in detail, it may be helpful to set forth definitions of certain terms that will be used hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The term &#x201c;cellular communication network&#x201d; as used herein in this application, is defined as any radio frequency (RF) based communication network that is based upon geographical partition of space into cells. Each cell is provided with at least one base station that manages the wireless communication therein. Various cellular communication standards are currently in use while other are being developed. The popular ones are: UMTS, HSPA, GSM, CDMA-2000, TD-SCDMA, LTE and WiMAX.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The term &#x201c;Macrocell&#x201d; as used herein in this application, also known as Macrocell Base Station (MBS) is defined as a cell in a mobile phone network that provides radio coverage served by a power cellular base station (e.g. tower). The antennas for macrocells are usually mounted on ground-based masts, rooftops and other existing structures, at a height that provides a clear view over the surrounding buildings and terrain. Macrocell base stations have power outputs of typically few watts to tens of watts.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The term &#x201c;Femtocell&#x201d; as used herein in this application, also known as Femtocell Base Station (FBS) or Home NodeB is defined as a small cellular communication base station, typically designed for use in residential, enterprise or small business environments. The femtocell connects to the service provider's network via broadband (such as DSL or cable). Current designs typically support 2 to 5 mobile phones simultaneously in a residential setting, and it is possible to increase the number to 16. A femtocell allows service providers to extend service coverage and capacity indoors, especially where access would otherwise be limited or unavailable. The femtocell incorporates the functionality of a typical base station but extends it to allow a simpler, self contained deployment. By way of example, a UMTS femtocell may contain a Node B, RNC and GSN with Ethernet for backhaul.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The term &#x201c;frame&#x201d; as used herein in this application is the term used in digital communication systems (e.g., cellular communication networks) to define a fixed block of data transmitted as a single entity. Each frame contains a predefined number of &#x201c;chips&#x201d; wherein each &#x201c;chip&#x201d; represents a predefined period of time. The length of all frames in a given cellular communication network is equal and is defined by the &#x201c;frame borders&#x201d; or &#x201c;frame boundaries&#x201d;. The position on the timescale in which the frame starts is referred to as &#x201c;frame position&#x201d;. The &#x201c;temporal transmit position&#x201d; is the position on the timescale in which the signal begins. Each frame usually starts with transmit signal for a predefined time which then turns off for the reminder of the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic high level block diagram illustrating a cellular communication network comprising both macrocell base stations and femtocell base stations according to the prior art. The cellular communication network comprises a mobile operator network <b>40</b> coupled to a macrocell base station (MBS) <b>20</b> and two femtocell base stations (FBS) <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B via gateways and cables (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Each base station <b>20</b>, <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B creates a transmission sphere (or cell) around it <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> and <b>70</b> respectively that defines the geographical region in which the base station is operative. Each base station <b>20</b>, <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B is in communication with devices having wireless connectivity <b>30</b>A-<b>30</b>H, referred to in this application as &#x201c;User Equipment&#x201d; (UE) for the sake of simplicity. User Equipment <b>30</b>A-<b>30</b>H may comprise by way of example: cellular (mobile) phones, personal device accessories (PDA), laptop computers, handheld computers and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One of the challenges of the evolving femtocell base stations technology is avoiding transmitter collision sessions in neighboring cells array. Transmission collisions occur when a plurality of base stations are transmitting frames with overlapping or too close frame positions. Further, in the case of CDMA or W-CDMA these collisions may be notably severe, if the neighboring cells are using the same scrambling code or the same spreading code. In such a case decoding is not possible at all.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As collisions substantially degrade the quality of service, they need to be avoided completely. In macrocell base station deployment these collisions are avoided by carefully planning frame timing for each stationary macrocell base station in view of the neighboring stations. In some mobile technologies these collisions can further be avoided by assigning different scrambling codes or spreading codes to neighbor cells. Macrocell base stations are arranged such that they must support accurate transmission timing and different scrambling codes or spreading codes.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, in femtocell base stations technology where each user independently positions a femtocell bases station, careful planning of stations deployment is not possible. By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows a schematic block diagram of two neighboring femtocell base stations according to the prior art. Femtocell base stations <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B are spatially positioned such that their corresponding cells are overlapping over time and scrambling code such that User Equipment <b>30</b>A is in communication with both base stations <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows a timing diagram <b>80</b> corresponding to the operation of base stations <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B according to the prior art. As shown in diagram <b>80</b>, frame <b>90</b>A attributed to FMS <b>10</b>A starts at frame position <b>81</b>, exhibits valid data chips from <b>81</b> to <b>82</b>A, ends at <b>83</b>, and proceeds periodically therefrom. Similarly, frame <b>90</b>B attributed to FMS <b>10</b>B starts at same frame position <b>81</b>, also exhibits valid data chips from <b>81</b> to <b>82</b>A, ends at <b>83</b> and proceeds periodically therefrom. Clearly, this timing scheme is such that the frames positions of both femtocell base stations <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B are temporally positioned on the same spot, resulting in transmission session collision. Consequently, in operation, User Equipment <b>30</b>A will encounter severe difficulties in communicating with either femtocell base stations <b>10</b>A or <b>10</b>B. In fact, in the case that femtocell base stations <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B utilize the same scrambling code, such communication is deteriorated or not possible at all. Clearly, the aforementioned collision scenario may also occur between a femtocell base station and a macrocell base station. Further, due to non-equal or random minor time drifts of neighbor macrocells or femtocells, collisions are expected to happen periodically for significant intervals, wherein in these periods the communication is reduced or not available at all.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It would be therefore advantageous to provide a solution for avoiding transmitter collision sessions in neighboring femtocells array in order to facilitate independent femtocell base stations deployment.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, it is a principal object of the present invention to overcome the disadvantages of the prior art. This is provided in the present invention by adding transmitter timing adjust functionality to the femtocell base station.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In embodiments of the present invention, a control unit within the femtocell base station is arranged to detect a transmission collision situation and resolves it by adjusting the timing of the transmission signal and consequently the frame position gradually over time. The adjustment (or shift) is performed in a slow enough rate such that the User Equipments currently connected (camped) to the femtocell base station remain connected.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In embodiments of the present invention there is provided a method of avoiding transmitter collisions sessions in femtocells array.

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Embodiments of the present invention provide a femtocell base station control unit, a method and a cellular communication network arranged to avoid potential transmitter collision scenarios, which might disable femtocells base stations service. A femtocell base station operable in accordance with the present invention will be able to provide communication services in all deployment scenarios, and to resolve the lack of cell planning that characterizes femtocell arrays even in the case where neighbor cells use the same scrambling code or spreading codes.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is applicable to other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic block diagram of a femtocell base station according to some embodiments of the present invention. Femtocell base station <b>10</b> comprises a femtocell base station control unit <b>110</b> that comprises in turn a collisions avoidance module <b>100</b>. femtocell base station control unit <b>110</b> is coupled to and operatively associated with: an RF unit <b>150</b>; a flash based storage <b>140</b>; an SRAM memory <b>130</b>. Femtocell base station control unit <b>110</b> is further coupled to and operatively associated with a mobile operator network <b>40</b> via a 10/100 Ethernet physical layer module <b>120</b> and a gateway <b>170</b>. Femtocell base station <b>10</b> is in communication with user equipment <b>30</b>A-<b>30</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In operation, femtocell base station control unit <b>110</b> is arranged to manage and control the traffic in the cell associated with femtocell base station <b>10</b>. The femtocell traditional functionalities are achieved by femtocell base station control unit <b>110</b> in cooperation with RF unit <b>150</b>, flash based storage <b>140</b>, SRAM memory <b>130</b>, 10/100 Ethernet physical layer module <b>120</b>, gateway <b>170</b>, and mobile operator network <b>40</b>. In addition, collisions avoidance module <b>100</b> is operable to avoid transmit collisions with neighboring base stations.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Specifically, collisions avoidance module <b>100</b> attempts detection of neighboring base stations. In the case that neighboring base stations are detected, collisions avoidance module <b>100</b> detects frame boundaries of the transmitting signal of each detected neighboring base station and calculates the temporal transmit position such that the likelihood of transmit signals collisions is minimized.

<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a high level flow chart showing a method according to some embodiments of the invention. The disclosed method is a method of avoiding collision sessions in neighboring femtocell base station arrays, wherein each femtocell base station is operable to generate a transmission signal exhibiting periodic frames, each frame exhibiting frame boundaries and an active transmit signal within the frame boundaries, the active transmit signal having a temporal transmit position being the start point of the transmit signal the method comprising: attempting detection of neighboring base stations <b>410</b>; in the case that neighboring base stations are detected: detecting frame boundaries of the transmitting signal of each detected neighboring base station <b>420</b>; and subsequently calculating temporal transmit position such that the likelihood of transmit signals collisions is minimized in view of detected frame boundaries <b>430</b>; In the case that no neighboring base stations are detected for a predefined time, calculating the temporal transmit position such that the transmit position is the current transmit position added to a predefined number of chips <b>440</b>; then, in either case, setting temporal transmit position to calculated temporal transmit position <b>450</b>; and maintaining temporal transmit position by gradually adjusting transmit position over time <b>460</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows timing diagrams <b>510</b>, <b>520</b> and <b>530</b> of three femtocell base station illustrating the timing positions adjustment performed with regards to femtocell base station &#x201c;A&#x201d; according to the present invention. Specifically, after femtocell base station &#x201c;A&#x201d; has detected the presence of neighboring femtocell base stations &#x201c;B&#x201d;, &#x201c;C&#x201d; and &#x201c;D&#x201d;, and their corresponding frame boundaries and timing positions, optimal transmit position <b>512</b> is calculated, and set to femtocell base station &#x201c;A&#x201d;. As shown in diagrams <b>510</b>, <b>520</b> and <b>530</b>, transmit position for femtocell base station &#x201c;A&#x201d; was selected such that no collision may occur with any of femtocell base stations &#x201c;B&#x201d;, &#x201c;C&#x201d; or &#x201c;D&#x201d;. By way of example only, it may be shown that in relation with femtocell base station &#x201c;D&#x201d;, the transmit position was selected as the farthest position, while in relation with femtocell base station &#x201c;B&#x201d;, the transmit position is only shifted a few chips from the transit position of femtocell base station &#x201c;A&#x201d;. After adjusting the margins set above, embodiments of the present invention maintain and adjust the transmit position accordingly such that collisions are avoided and yet connected (camped) user equipment remains connected to the femtocell base station.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to some embodiments of the present invention, base stations (macrocells and femtocells alike) and specifically third generation (3G) cells detection may be achieved by adding a third/second generation (3G/2G) cells search module to the femtocell base station. This module is already used in User Equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to some embodiments of the present invention, base stations detection may be achieved by instructing the connected (camped) user equipment at a given time to measure the time difference between two cells by using, by way of example, CFN-SFN or SFN-SFN measurements reports.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to some embodiments of the present invention, the temporal transmit position exhibiting the minimal likelihood of collision with neighboring femtocells transmit signals is calculated by setting the femtocell transmit frame position as far as possible from the frame positions of any neighboring macrocell and other femtocells.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to some embodiments of the present invention, once the new timing position has been updated, the transmit adjustment performs the transmit timing update in a very slow manner. Specifically, the rate of timing correction is chosen such that connected (camped) user equipment on the cell of a given femtocell base station are capable to tack the change whether they are in Idle mode or Connected mode.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to some embodiments of the present invention, transmit timing adjustment for UMT networks is chosen such that it is slower than 25 chips in 5 seconds. Each elementary step should be less than a predefined number chips.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to some embodiments of the present invention, maintaining the new transmit timing position of a given femtocell base station and avoiding transmit timing drifts is achieved by a GPS receiver, NTP or PTP or any timing protocols over IP which provides reference in view of an absolute time reference.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to some embodiments of the present invention, maintaining the new transmit timing position of a given femtocell base station and avoiding transmit timing drifts is achieved by using highly accurate internal reference clock inside the femtocell base station or alternatively by using the macrocell base station timing which are relatively very accurate since they are connected to a central highly accurate clock.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to some embodiments of the present invention, in the case that neighboring cells timing cannot be detected, either temporarily or permanently, transmit adjust mechanism may be set to an &#x201c;updated transmit position&#x201d; which may be derived from the current transmit timing by adding a predefined number of chips. This update is done in case for a predefined period of time no user equipment has connected (camped) on the cells. This would be an indication that the femtocell has a transmit collision problem with other cell. This reduces the probability of transmission collision between the femtocells and the neighbor cells.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Advantageously, the present invention is aimed for the UMTS femtocells market. However, it is understood that the necessary modification may be performed in order to support any kind of cellular communication, in any standard. The functionality of the present invention serves as in cooperation with the femtocell base station control unit within that is arranged to perform all femtocell required activities within a standalone femtocell base station.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to some embodiments of the invention, the system can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer hardware, firmware, software, or in combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The invention can be implemented advantageously in one or more computer programs that are executable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a data storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device. A computer program is a set of instructions that can be used, directly or indirectly, in a computer to perform a certain activity or bring about a certain result. A computer program can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment.</p>
