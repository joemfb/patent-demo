<p id="p-0033" num="0032">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, there is shown an exemplary user interface for selecting and causing initiation of (initiating) an IP based voice communication connections between an inspection apparatus and an external computer. In one aspect, visual inspection apparatus <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> is configured to include a user interface enabling an inspector to cause initiation of (to initiate) an IP based voice communication connection with a computer of said system <b>1000</b> external to said visual inspection apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a user interface of apparatus <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> can include a graphical user interface including a setup button <b>1102</b> and an initiate button <b>1104</b>. In the exemplary example, apparatus <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> can be configured so that setup selections can be activated and deactivated by actuation of the buttons (e.g., clicking on). In the exemplary example, a button can be highlighted (e.g., displayed in a different color) to designate an active state. It is expected that during the course of operating an inspection apparatus it may be desirable for an inspector to initiate a voice communication connection with one or more computers of system <b>1000</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For example, an inspector may note a problem with an inspection article being subject to inspection and may wish to orally report the problem to persons at spaced apart locations receiving the data being collected during a current inspection. An inspector may also wish to report the problem to one or more owners, experts (supervisors) and other inspectors (peers). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, actuating setup button <b>1102</b> can bring up a configuration window <b>1106</b> for designating information which can be used by apparatus <b>100</b> in initiating an IP based communication connection. Responsively to an actuation of initiate button <b>1104</b> by an inspector after a setup has been completed, inspection apparatus <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> can initiate the IP based voice communication connection utilizing information designed during setup.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to window <b>1106</b>, window <b>1106</b> can include contemporaneous receiver button <b>1112</b> like equipment inspections button <b>1114</b>; group button <b>1116</b>, one button <b>1118</b>, more than one button <b>1120</b>, and configure button <b>1122</b>. When one button <b>1118</b> is selected, apparatus <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> is set up to address an IP based voice communication connection to a single address. When more than one button <b>1120</b> is selected, apparatus <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> is set up to address an IP based voice communication connection to more than one IP address. By actuating configure button <b>1122</b> or configure button <b>1152</b>, an inspector can indicate that all setup parameters have been finalized.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Certain examples described here forward will discuss the case where the particular inspection apparatus <b>100</b> collects data and addresses data packets to a central server <b>720</b>. However, it will be understood that any other apparatus of system <b>1000</b> can collect and send data, and that data collected by an inspection apparatus can be addressed to a computer other than server <b>720</b>, for example, data collected by an inspection apparatus can be sent by addressing data packets to one or more workstation computers.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Still referring to the graphical user interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, by actuating contemporaneous receivers button <b>1112</b>, an inspector can configure an apparatus, e.g., apparatus <b>100</b> so that when a next IP based voice communication connection is initiated responsively to an actuation of initiate button <b>1104</b>, data packets containing voice data are addressed to computers of system <b>1000</b> contemporaneously receiving data from inspection apparatus <b>100</b>. By a computer contemporaneously receiving data from an apparatus <b>100</b> it is meant that the computer is currently receiving data from the computer (e.g., as in a stream) or has received data (e.g., an image file, video file including an audiovisual file or other data collected by the apparatus) within a predetermined time window (e.g., 10 minutes, 1 hour) or has received data collected by apparatus during the course of completing a current inspection having a predetermined number of inspection requirements. Computers contemporaneously receiving data can be regarded as contemporaneous receivers. Contemporaneous receivers can comprise two varieties: addressees and third party requesters. A contemporaneous receiver computer can be regarded as an addressee if an apparatus, e.g., <b>100</b> is currently addressing data packets to the computer or has addressed a data packet to the computer within a predetermined time window or has addressed data packet to the computer during the course of completing a current inspection having a predetermined number of inspection requirements. In some instances an apparatus, e.g., <b>100</b> may be sending collected inspection data such as media files to a central computer, e.g., server <b>720</b>, and one or more workstation computers of system, e.g., computer <b>620</b> may request data from the server <b>720</b>. In such instances, apparatus <b>100</b> will not be addressing data packets collected during an inspection to the computer <b>620</b> directly but rather will address data packets to server <b>720</b>. Computer <b>620</b>, in the described example, can be regarded as a third party requester (receiver) computer since it receives data from apparatus <b>100</b> not from apparatus <b>100</b> directly but by requesting the data from a central computer <b>720</b> to which the data packets are addressed and that has been designated as a central repository for the data. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, apparatus <b>100</b> can be configured so that when contemporaneous receivers button <b>1112</b> is actuated, window <b>1132</b> is displayed to allow an inspector to select by actuation of button <b>1134</b> and button <b>1136</b> whether a next IP based voice communication connection, when initiated, will be addressed to addressees, third party requesters, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">For informing inspection apparatus <b>100</b> of a list addresses for third party requests, a central server <b>720</b>, in the example described, can incorporate an application for monitoring data requests from computers of system <b>1000</b>. When central server <b>720</b> receives a request from a computer, e.g., computer <b>620</b> for data collected from a particular inspection apparatus, e.g., apparatus <b>100</b>, in the example described, central server <b>720</b>, in accordance with the monitoring application, can send a communication to the particular inspection apparatus <b>100</b> informing the inspection apparatus <b>100</b> of the data request. In such manner inspection apparatus <b>100</b> can maintain a list of contemporaneous receiver computers, even where such computers are third party requesters. Inspection apparatus <b>100</b> in turn can selectively address external computers utilizing such list when commanded to initiate an IP based voice communication connection. Contemporaneous receivers can be regarded as computers which are currently receiving data collected and transmitted by apparatus <b>100</b> (e.g., as in streaming video data packets) or which have recently received data from apparatus <b>100</b>, e.g., within a designated time window or which has received data collected by apparatus <b>100</b> in the course of completing an inspection having a predetermined number of requirements, at least one of which has not yet completed. System <b>1000</b> can be configured so that such a designated time window is user adjustable. For example, the time window can be adjusted between various time windows of short duration of less than, e.g., 1 day (5 hours, 1 hour, 10 minutes, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">By actuating contemporaneous receivers button <b>1112</b>, an inspector can set up apparatus <b>100</b> so that an IP based voice communication connection will be addressed to a computer which is contemporaneously receiving data from apparatus <b>100</b>. In such manner, the voice communication connection, e.g., which may alert as to a problem and which will allow an inspector to verbally explain a problem will be addressed to a computer or computers which can be expected to have users who are viewing or which have recently viewed data collected by the inspection apparatus. It has been explained that contemporaneous receiver computers of system <b>1000</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can include computers that are currently receiving streaming data (e.g., MPEG4 streaming video data) being colleted by apparatus <b>100</b>. Accordingly, it is seen that system <b>1000</b> can be configured so that when initiate button <b>1104</b> is actuated by an inspector, apparatus <b>100</b> can initiate an IP based voice communication connection (e.g., a VOIP connection) while a computer is currently receiving streaming video data being collected by apparatus <b>100</b>. Accordingly, apparatus <b>100</b> can be configured to simultaneously support a streaming audio VOIP communication and a streaming video (e.g., MPEG4) communication over a common connection.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, by actuating button <b>1114</b> an inspector can designate that the inspector would like a next IP based voice communication connection to be addressed to a computer being used by an inspector who is inspecting a like equipment article to the one currently being inspected by the inspector of apparatus <b>100</b>. A like equipment article can be identical equipment article or an equipment article of the same type. When button <b>1114</b> is selected, an address for sending of voice data packets may be determined by way of examining data collected by several inspection apparatus <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As has been indicated, system <b>1000</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be set up so that each apparatus <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> sends data to a central server <b>720</b> retaining a central database <b>820</b>. Each media file (e.g., image file, video file including audio visual file) collected by apparatus <b>100</b> can have associated metadata (data about the data). The metadata can be written to an empty field of the media file. Alternatively, the metadata can also be written to a separate file such as a document (e.g., XML file) that apparatus <b>100</b> creates for each media file collected. A document file for each media file can comprise a reference to the media file and metadata associated with the media file. The reference can include document text that indicates the media file or the reference can be provided by commonly naming the document file and its reference media file. Inspection metadata and guided inspection procedures are described further in U.S. patent application No. (Not Yet Assigned), filed Dec. 22, 2006 entitled, &#x201c;Inspection Apparatus For Inspecting Articles&#x201d; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and U.S. Patent Application No. 60/786,829 filed Mar. 27, 2006 also incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Metadata associated with each media file can comprise alternative forms, e.g., equipment number (equipment #), job number (job #), inspector, apparatus number (apparatus #), and timestamp (the time at which the media file was collected). Such metadata identifies an inspection being performed. A central server, e.g., server <b>720</b> can be configured to examine incoming media files and/or their associated document files sent to it from various inspection apparatuses <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b>, and populate metadata from examined files into a database <b>820</b>, which may be provided by a multi-table relational database.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one example, a designated central server may retain a database <b>820</b> having a table <b>1202</b> and a table <b>1204</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Referring to table <b>1202</b>, table <b>1202</b> can include equipment #, column <b>1206</b>, inspection apparatus column <b>1208</b>, timestamp column <b>1210</b>, file column <b>1212</b>, and inspector column <b>1214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one example, system <b>1000</b> can be configured so that when like equipment inspectors button <b>1114</b> is actuated, system <b>1000</b> examines database <b>820</b> including data collected by several apparatuses <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> during past inspections to determine appropriate inspectors to contact when initiating a next IP based voice communication connection. System <b>1000</b> can be configured so that when button <b>1122</b> is actuated with like inspectors equipment button <b>1114</b> highlighted, apparatus <b>100</b> sends a command to server <b>720</b> to query database <b>820</b> to return a list of addresses to which a next initiated IP based voice communication connection can be addressed. Standard Query Language (SQL) commands may be utilized. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, each equipment article of a set of equipment articles is given a unique equipment article where a three digit prefix of the equipment article indicates an equipment type. In one example, when configure button <b>1122</b> of apparatus <b>100</b> is actuated with like equipment inspectors button <b>1114</b> highlighted, system <b>1000</b> might be configured to return information corresponding to inspectors who are contemporaneously inspecting similar equipment articles. A contemporaneously inspecting inspector can be regarded an inspector who has collected a file for sending to database <b>820</b> within a predetermined time window (e.g., 10 min., 1 hour). System <b>1000</b>, in such an embodiment, could return an address corresponding to inspector Smith who, as is indicated by table <b>1202</b>, is contemporaneously inspecting with use of inspection apparatus <b>100</b>, an equipment article 123AAB which is of a like type as the inspection article being inspected by inspector Johnson with use of inspection apparatus <b>100</b> (taking the example where database <b>820</b> is queried at 10:00 and a predetermined time window is 1 hour of the query). When a query of database <b>820</b> returns information corresponding to inspector Smith, apparatus <b>100</b> is set up so that when initiate button <b>1104</b> is actuated, an IP voice communication connection is initiated between apparatus <b>100</b> and inspector Smith. In returning information corresponding to inspector Smith, system <b>1000</b> may return more than one item of information. One item of information that system <b>1000</b> may return is the address of apparatus <b>110</b> that is currently being used by inspector Smith; that is, the address corresponding to apparatus <b>110</b>. Another item of information that may be returned to inspector Smith is a personal mobile phone identifier of inspector Smith such as a VOIP phone number of inspector Smith corresponding to a mobile phone <b>400</b>, <b>410</b>, of inspector Smith. It is seen that database <b>820</b> can include more than one table. For example, table <b>1204</b> can include an inspector column <b>1232</b> and a VOIP phone number. System <b>1000</b> can be configured so that once querying of table <b>1202</b> returns an inspector, table <b>1204</b> can be queried to return a VOIP phone number of a personal mobile phone such as mobile phone <b>400</b>, <b>410</b> of inspector Smith. In addition to returning information corresponding to inspectors contemporaneously inspecting a like type but different equipment article when like equipment inspectors button is actuated, system <b>1000</b> can be configured to return information corresponding to inspectors who have previously inspected the identical equipment article irrespective of any time window. When like equipment inspectors button <b>1114</b> has been actuated, system <b>1000</b> may return a VOIP phone number (VOIP #) for inspector Martin who has previously inspected the equipment article identified by 123AAA. In returning VOIP # for inspector Martin, system <b>1000</b> may query table <b>1202</b> in order to return the identity of the inspector, and then query table <b>1204</b> keying using the identified inspector to return an appropriate VOIP # from table <b>1234</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">System <b>1000</b> in one embodiment can be configured so that when button <b>1114</b> is actuated, window <b>1162</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is displayed allowing an inspector to select whether a time window for filtering like inspector identifiers will be active and if so, the period for such time window. In the example provided, button <b>1164</b> can be actuated to designate a 10 minute time window, button <b>1166</b> for 1 hour time window and button <b>1168</b> for no time window. System <b>1000</b> can be configured so that time window selection window <b>1172</b> can be displayed when contemporaneous receivers button <b>1112</b> is actuated prompting an inspector to define a criteria for qualifying as a contemporaneous receiver. If button <b>1174</b> is highlighted a 10 minute time window is applied in determining whether a receiving computer is a contemporaneous receiver, if button <b>1176</b> is highlighted, an hour time window is applied. If button <b>1178</b> is highlighted, computers currently receiving data from the inspection apparatus being subject to setup qualify as contemporaneous receivers. If button <b>1180</b> is highlighted, computers receiving data of a current incomplete inspection procedure qualify as contemporaneous receivers.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is seen that a query of database <b>820</b> can return an address of both an apparatus <b>101</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> and a mobile telephone <b>400</b>, <b>410</b>, configuring apparatus <b>100</b> so that when initiate button <b>1114</b> is actuated, apparatus <b>100</b> can concurrently initiate an IP based voice communication connection to both of a wireline connected inspection apparatus <b>101</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> and a cellular network connected mobile telephone <b>400</b>, <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, apparatus <b>100</b> can include groups button <b>1116</b>. Apparatus <b>100</b> can be configured so that when groups button <b>1116</b> is actuated, window <b>1151</b> appears enabling an inspector to designate one or more owners, experts (supervisors), or inspectors (peers) to whom a next IP based voice communication connection is to be made. In one example, database <b>820</b> can include several tables mapping names of owners, experts (supervisors) and peers (inspectors) to VOIP #S. When a certain name has been designated using apparatus <b>100</b>, apparatus <b>100</b> can query database <b>820</b> for the VOIP phone #. Apparatus <b>100</b> can then query a VOIP # server (not shown) to return a current IP address corresponding to the VOIP # in order to determine an address for addressing an IP based voice communication connection. After a query of VOIP sever returns a current IP address, actuation of initiate button <b>1104</b> can initiate an IP based voice communication with a computer in the form of a mobile phone, e.g., computer <b>400</b> where computer <b>400</b> is the mobile phone of the selected owner, expert, or peer of system <b>1000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Further regarding the user interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the inventors observed that an intended human recipient of an IP based voice communication connection initiated by apparatus <b>100</b> may not be present at a computer of system <b>1000</b> associated with the intended recipient at a time when a voice communication connection is initiated. Accordingly, system <b>1000</b> can be configured so that each workstation computer <b>600</b>, <b>601</b>, <b>610</b>, <b>611</b> and each inspection apparatus <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> is configured to automatically record an audio file (e.g., a WAV file) for later listening by an intended human recipient corresponding to each IP voice communication connection initiated between an inspection apparatus <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> and a workstation computer <b>600</b>, <b>601</b>, <b>610</b>, <b>611</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In another aspect, system <b>1000</b> can be configured to automatically signal an alarm condition in response to examining of file data and/or associated metadata of a file collected by an inspection apparatus (e.g., apparatus <b>100</b>). As part of signaling an alarm condition, system <b>1000</b> may responsively (automatically) initiate an IP based voice communication connection between the inspection apparatus collecting the examined data and one or more specific supervisory workstation computers determined to be contemporaneously receiving data collected by apparatus <b>100</b>. As part of signaling an alarm condition, system <b>1000</b> may also cause textual messages to be displayed on a collecting inspection apparatus and/or a supervisory workstation indicating the nature of the location (e.g., apparatus indicator) of the event giving rise to an alarm condition.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, as has been described, system <b>1000</b> can be configured so that each inspection apparatus <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> sends data such as file data and associated metadata to a central server, e.g., server <b>720</b>, which can process the received data in the population of an organized database <b>820</b>, which can be e.g., a relational database or an object oriented database. In a further aspect, system <b>1000</b> (and in one embodiment server <b>720</b> specifically) can be configured to examine file data and/or associated metadata in order to check for the presence of a condition giving rise to an alarm condition. Responsively to the examination of file data and/or metadata, system <b>1000</b> (specifically server <b>720</b> in one embodiment) can signal an alarm condition. Metadata associated with file data, as has been mentioned, can include equipment #, inspector, job #, apparatus identifier. Metadata can also include data generated by a sensor, e.g., location data as generated by a GPS device or temperature data. In one example, image signals generated by image sensor <b>132</b> can be processed to determine a temperature in head assembly <b>114</b>. For example, a presence of noise of certain characteristics may be interpreted to be an indicator of a certain temperature in head assembly <b>114</b>. A temperature of head assembly <b>114</b>, as determined by processing of image signals generated by image sensor <b>132</b>, can be associated with collected files as metadata. Alternatively, temperature thermistor <b>125</b> can be disposed in head assembly <b>114</b>, and can generate an output signal indicative of temperature which can be input into DSP <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In examining for the presence of an alarm condition, system <b>1000</b> (and in one embodiment server <b>720</b>) can examine file data and/or metadata. For example, in examining file data, server <b>720</b> can subject a collected image file or frame of a video file to pattern recognition processing and an alarm condition may be signaled on the detection of a certain object, e.g., a recognized crack in an equipment article. In another example, server <b>720</b> may examine incoming metadata. For example, server <b>720</b> may examine head assembly temperature data associated with each file and can determine that an alarm condition is present if a head assembly temperature associated with a certain file is above a predetermined temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">When server <b>720</b> in the described embodiment determines that an alarm condition is present, system <b>1000</b> can cause inspection apparatus <b>100</b> and supervisory computers, (e.g., which may be workstation computers <b>620</b> and <b>611</b> in one example) contemporaneously receiving data from apparatus <b>100</b> to display textual messages on displays thereof indicating the nature and possibly the location of the condition giving rise to the alarm condition. For example, inspection apparatus <b>100</b> may be caused to display the messaged CRACK DETECTED or HEAD TOO HOT. Supervisory computers <b>620</b>, <b>611</b> may be caused to display the textual messages CRACK DETECTED BY APPARATUS <b>100</b> or HEAD OF APPARATUS <b>100</b> TOO HOT.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Various methods can be employed for determining the identity of the one or more workstation computers contemporaneously receiving data from inspection apparatus <b>100</b>. Workstation computers that have contemporaneously received data from inspection apparatus <b>100</b> can include (1) workstation computers which are currently receiving data from an inspection apparatus <b>100</b>, (2) workstation computers which have received data from an inspection apparatus <b>100</b> within a time window, which time window can be user selectable and (3) workstation computers receiving data corresponding to a current inspection having a predetermined number of requirements, at least one of which has not yet been satisfied. For determination of the present set of supervisory workstation computers, server <b>720</b> may maintain a log file summarizing data requests by workstation computers <b>600</b>, <b>601</b>, <b>610</b>, <b>611</b>, <b>620</b>, <b>621</b>, receiving data collected from specific ones of apparatuses <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> and sent to server <b>720</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The identity of the inspection apparatus <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> that has collected data (e.g., a media file such as an image file or video file such as an audio visual file) and has sent the collected data to server <b>720</b> can be determined simply by examining data packets received (e.g., by server <b>720</b>) from the inspection apparatus, which will include at least one address of the inspection apparatus. There is therefore described herein, an inspection system for inspecting industrial equipment articles, the inspection system comprising: a visual inspection apparatus having an elongated inspection apparatus and a two dimensional image sensor, said visual inspection apparatus having software and hardware enabling IP based voice communications with a computer in IP network communication with said visual inspection apparatus, a workstation computer having a user interface in communication with said visual inspection apparatus, the system having at least one computer receiving a media file collected by said visual inspection apparatus and metadata associated with said media file, the system being configured to process at least one of said media file and said associated metadata received from said visual inspection apparatus, the system being configured to read an address of a data packet comprising data of said media file and further being configured to initiate an IP based voice communication connection between said workstation computer and said visual inspection apparatus responsively to said processing of at least one of said media file and said associated metadata utilizing said address read from said data packet.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When an alarm condition is signaled, system <b>1000</b>, in addition to causing display of textual messages at the appropriate inspection apparatus <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> and the appropriate workstation computers contemporaneously receiving data from the inspection apparatus can establish an IP based voice communication connection between inspection apparatus <b>100</b> and one or more workstation computers determined to be the workstation computers contemporaneously receiving data from inspection apparatus <b>100</b>. In establishing such a connection, system <b>1000</b> can cause such an IP based voice communication connection to be initiated by one or more workstation computers or by an inspection apparatus. In one example, system <b>1000</b> can be configured so that server <b>720</b> can examine data (e.g., metadata and/or associated file data) collected by an apparatus and responsively to an alarm condition being determined (detected) can establish an IP based voice communication by sending a communication including a command to an appropriate workstation computer commanding the workstation computer to initiate an IP based voice communication connection with an appropriate inspection apparatus. Also, system <b>1000</b> can be configured so that server <b>720</b> can examine data collected by an apparatus and responsively to an alarm condition server <b>720</b> can establish an IP based voice communication connection by sending a command to an appropriate inspection apparatus commanding the inspection apparatus to initiate an IP based voice communication connection with one or more appropriate workstation computers. After an IP based voice communication connection has been initiated, an expert (supervisor) working at a workstation computer can provide voice instructions regarding the alarm condition. Also, an inspector at the inspection apparatus can orally ask questions of a supervisor operating a workstation computer, or and/or can provide detailed information to the expert (supervisor) regarding the problem giving rise to the alarm condition.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In another aspect of system <b>1000</b>, system <b>1000</b> can be configured so that each apparatus <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> can automatically record in a suitable audio file format e.g., WAV file, recording of each IP based voice communication executed by the given inspection apparatus in the performance of an inspection. By recording of IP based voice communications, additional, more robust information is provided as part of the inspection data. For example, if a problem is noted regarding an equipment article during an inspection a recorded oral conversation regarding the problem between an inspector and an expert (supervisor) can be provided as part of the inspection record. In one embodiment, audio files corresponding to IP based voice communication connection executed by inspection apparatus <b>100</b> during the course of performing an inspection are saved in such manner as to allow the audio files to be easily reviewed as part of a review of data respecting an inspection.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, in one embodiment of system <b>1000</b>, media files (e.g., image files and video files including multimedia files) that are collected during an inspection procedure and audio files (e.g., WAV files) recording IP based voice communication connections (voice communication connection audio files) are associated with common metadata. By associating visual media files and voice communication connection audio files with common metadata, the media files and voice communication connection audio files can be commonly returned when searching a database (e.g., database <b>820</b>) including the files under one of the common metadata types. In one example, both collected visual media files and recorded voice communication audio files are associated with equipment # metadata that identifies a current inspection. In one example, both collected visual media files and recorded voice communication audio files are associated with job # metadata that identifies a current inspection. In one example, both collected visual media files and recorded voice communication audio files are associated with an inspection procedure identifier (which may or may not be provided by an equipment identifier e.g., equipment #). In one example, both collected visual media files and voice communication audio files are associated with timestamp metadata that identifies a current inspection. In one example, both collected visual media files and recorded voice communication audio files are associated with each of the above types of metadata that identify a current inspection.</p>
