<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2006-311775, filed Nov. 17, 2006, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to an image display method and an image display apparatus for displaying a moving image of an object of examination such as a coronary artery for determining an optimum direction of observation of the object by a medical X-ray apparatus when reading the moving image of the object that can be acquired by means of a medical equipment such as an X-ray diagnostic apparatus for intravascular surgery (intervention).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Objects of examination of human bodies include coronary arteries. Coronary arteries surround the heart as blood vessels to supply blood to the muscles of the heart. A serious condition arises when any of the coronary arteries falls into a morbid state such as stenosis. An intravascular intervention using an X-ray diagnostic apparatus is brought in to cure such a disease.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An intravascular intervention using an X-ray diagnostic apparatus is a risky manual operation of driving a surgery device into a coronary artery. For the intervention, the detector of the X-ray diagnostic apparatus is rigidly secured in position and X-rays are continuously irradiated from a selected view angle, while the operator proceeds with the manipulation, seeing the image of the blood vessel being displayed on the monitor screen as object of examination. The manipulation can be facilitated when the operator can see an image of the blood vessel taken from an optimal view angle.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</figref> of the accompanying drawings show how a part of a human body appears in tow different view angles. The view angles include view angle &#x3b8; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> and view angle &#xf8; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. By turn, the view angle &#x3b8; is expressed in terms of a head direction (CRA) and a tail direction (CAU) relative to the object of examination <b>1</b> of a human body, whereas the view angle &#xf8; is expressed in terms of a first tilt direction (RAO) and a second tilt direction (LAO) relative to the object of examination <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, when the view angle is shifted from an optimal view angle during the intervention, the coronary artery in question may be overlapped with other blood vessel or a branching blood vessel may be overlapped with the coronary artery to consequently give rise to a phenomenon of foreshortening, where the coronary artery appears shorter than its proper length. Such a phenomenon makes the manipulation of the intervention difficult. Therefore, it is important to find out an optimal view angle from the information acquired before the intervention. In the case of a coronary artery, foreshortening is a phenomenon that makes the length of the coronary artery projected onto a two-dimensional plane appear shorter than the length of the coronary artery actually running in a three-dimensional space. Foreshortening 0% refers to that the actual length of the coronary artery is equal to the apparent length thereof and foreshortening 100% refers to that the coronary artery appears simply as a spot.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is a technique of determining an optimal view angle for an intervention. With this technique, a technology of three-dimensionally displaying a rotating coronary artery (coronary 3D, coronary tree) on a monitor screen on the basis of X-ray images in two directions is employed to determine an optimal view angle. This technique has become popular for clinical applications.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> of the accompanying drawings schematically illustrates how a three-dimensional image is structured by epipolar geometry. For example, let us refer to the projected image of coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>of a human body picked up by imaging the coronary artery from a frontal direction as Frontal Image <b>2</b> and the projected image picked up by imaging the coronary artery from a direction different from the frontal direction, or a lateral direction, as Lateral Image <b>3</b>. The part of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>projected on point A on the Lateral Image <b>3</b> is found somewhere on line B but cannot be identified. The line B is projected onto line C on the Frontal Image <b>2</b>. The coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is projected somewhere on the line C. Thus, as the operator of the intervention manually specifies the corresponding point on the Frontal Image <b>2</b>, the position of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>in a three-dimensional space is defined. In other words, it is necessary to specify the coordinates of the point on the Frontal Image <b>2</b> and those of the corresponding point on the Lateral Image <b>3</b> in order to identify the three-dimensional position of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> schematically illustrates how a rotating blood vessel is displayed three-dimensionally on a monitor screen. The rotating blood vessel is displayed three-dimensionally as a moving image that is obtained when the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is observed in the first tilt direction (RAO) and the second tilt direction (LAO) and the view angle (point of view) is shifted. Each of the arrows in the three-dimensional images of the blood vessel indicates the rotating/moving direction of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">More specifically, a moving image that is obtained when the view angle is continuously shifted with time to RAO=50&#xb0;, RAO=90&#xb0;, RAO=130&#xb0;, . . . , LAO=10&#xb0; is displayed on a monitor screen. Only the view angles of RAO and LAO of RAO=50&#xb0;, RAO=90&#xb0;, RAO=130&#xb0;, . . . , LAO=10&#xb0; are shown for the purpose of simplicity. The moving image that is obtained as the view angle is shifted relative to the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>appears as a rotating image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a</i>. Thus, an optimal view angle can be determined from the rotating image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>being displayed on the monitor screen.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An optimal view angle is such that, for example, (a) an angle that makes the morbid part, e.g., a stenotic part, appear longest, which is an angle that makes branched blood vessels, if any, appear wide open, (b) an angle that makes the morbid part, e.g., a stenotic part, appear narrowest, (c) an angle that makes the morbid part, e.g., a stenotic part, free from any other overlapping blood vessel or (d) an angle that makes the morbid part appear moving least.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Blood vessels change their positions as the heart beats. An optimal view angle is determined for a blood vessel so as to structure a three-dimensional blood vessel image in a cardiac phase at a moment of the moving blood vessel and satisfy above (a), (b), (c). However, the determined optimal view angle cannot necessarily be optimal in all the cardiac phases. In other words, if such a view angle is optimal in a cardiac phase, it may not necessarily be so in other cardiac phases and hence the requirements of above (a), (b), (c) may not necessarily be satisfied in other cardiac phases. Additionally, it is not possible to determine an optimal view angle in terms of (d) an angle that makes the morbid part appear moving least. For example, if any other blood vessel does not overlap the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>in a cardiac phase, the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is more often than not hidden by some other blood vessel to make an intervention difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A heat phase can be explained by means of an electrocardiogram signal as follows. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is obtained by sensing the movement of the heart as an electrical signal. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> of the accompanying drawings, an R-wave appears when the ventricle begins contraction. A cardiac phase shows a temporal phase of the electrocardiogram signal E in the time interval from an R-wave to the next R-wave. Generally, an R-wave is defined as 0% temporal phase and the next R-wave is defined as 100% temporal phase and the temporal phase at any moment in the time interval is determined by means of the temporal ratio of the moment. For example, an end-diastolic phase is expressed to be at or near 75% temporal phase.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As pointed out above, the determined optimal view angle cannot necessarily be optimal in all the cardiac phases. To solve this problem, a technique of preparing four-dimensional data of (x, y, z, t) including three-dimensional spatial image data of (x, y, z) and temporal elements (t) and determining an optimal view angle for all the cardiac phases by means of these four-dimensional data may be conceivable.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">However, the data obtained by means of such a technique include both information acquired when the view angle is shifted and information on the movement of the heart. Then, the image displayed on the monitor screen is a three-dimensional image of a blood vessel that is obtained when the view angle is shifted to which the heartbeat movement is added. When both the shift of the view angle and the heartbeat movement are displayed on the monitor screen, the movement of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>shown on the monitor screen becomes complicated to make it difficult to determine an optimal view angle. Determine separately an optimal view angle by shifting the view angle and also an optimal view angle in a cardiac phase results in determining only a locally optimal view angle to make it very time consuming to determine an optimal view angle for all the cardiac phases. Known documents relating to this technical field include U.S. Pat. No. 6,501,848.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention provides an image display method and an image display apparatus that can display an image for determining an optimal view angle in a short period of time.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Now, the first embodiment of the present invention will be described by referring to the related ones of the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic block diagram of the first embodiment of image display apparatus according to the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, medical equipment <b>11</b> is connected to the main body <b>10</b> of the image display apparatus. The medical equipment <b>11</b> images an object of examination <b>1</b> that shows a periodic contracting movement such as the coronary arteries <b>1</b><i>a </i>extending around and surrounding a heart showing a heartbeat movement and acquires image data on the object. The medical equipment <b>11</b> may typically be an X-ray apparatus, an X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) apparatus, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) apparatus, a positron emission computed tomography (PET) apparatus, a single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) apparatus, an ultrasound diagnosis (US) apparatus, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), or an X-ray diagnostic apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The image display apparatus main body <b>10</b> processes the image data and displays an image of a coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a</i>. The image display apparatus main body <b>10</b> has a main control section <b>12</b> that includes a CPU. The main control section <b>12</b> is connected to an image data storage section <b>13</b> and a program memory <b>14</b>. The main control section <b>12</b> issues commands to operate a four-dimensional data structuring section <b>15</b>, a view angle setting section <b>16</b>, an image data preparing section <b>17</b>, a display control section <b>18</b> and an operation section <b>19</b> that typically includes a keyboard, a mouse and ten keys. A monitor <b>20</b> such as a liquid crystal display is connected to the display control section <b>18</b>. An input section <b>21</b> is connected to the main control section <b>12</b>. An electrocardiograph (ECG) <b>22</b> is connected to the input section <b>21</b>. The electrocardiograph <b>22</b> outputs the movement of the object of examination <b>1</b>, or the heart, as electrocardiogram signal E. For example, the surgeon who is going to perform an intravascular intervention operates the operation section <b>19</b> when he or she needs to determine an optimal view angle relative to the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the object of examination <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The four-dimensional data structuring section <b>15</b> receives the image data on the object of examination <b>1</b> acquired by the medical equipment <b>11</b> and structures four-dimensional image data (x, y, z, t) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> from the image data. Such four-dimensional image data <b>4</b>D are prepared by volume rendering, which is a technique for three-dimensional display. Such four-dimensional image data <b>4</b>D are prepared by maximum intensity projection (MIP). Maximum intensity projection (MIP) is being popularly used for displaying blood vessels by means of an MRI apparatus, an X-ray CT apparatus or a US apparatus. Four-dimensional image data <b>4</b>D are formed by image data of a three-dimensional space (x, y, z) and temporal elements (t). The four-dimensional image data <b>4</b>D are then stored in the image data storage section <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The view angle setting section <b>16</b> typically selects a plurality of view angles relative to the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the object of examination <b>1</b>. Each of the view angles is set by an input operation of the surgeon who is going to perform an intravascular intervention. Each view angle is defined by view angle &#x3b8; that is expressed in terms of a head direction (CRA) and a tail direction (CAU) relative to the object of examination <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> and view angle &#xf8; that is expressed in terms of a first tilt direction (RAO) and a second tilt direction (LAO) relative to the object of examination <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The plurality of view angles F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>3</sub>, . . . , F<sub>j </sub>are set, for example, as nine (j=9) fixed view angles including F<sub>1 </sub>(RAO 30&#xb0;, CRA 20&#xb0;), F<sub>2 </sub>(0&#xb0;, CRA 20&#xb0;), F<sub>3 </sub>(LAO 50&#xb0;, CRA 20&#xb0;), F<sub>4 </sub>(RAO 30&#xb0;, 0&#xb0;), F<sub>5 </sub>(0&#xb0;, 0&#xb0;), F<sub>6 </sub>(LAO 50&#xb0;, 0&#xb0;), F<sub>7 </sub>(RAO 30&#xb0;, CAU 30), F<sub>8 </sub>(0&#xb0;, CAU 30&#xb0;) and F<sub>9 </sub>(LAO 50&#xb0;, CAU 30&#xb0;). Note, however, that view angles are not limited to the above nine view angles of F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>3</sub>, . . . , F<sub>9 </sub>and can be arbitrarily selected by the surgeon who is going to perform an intravascular intervention. For the purpose of the present invention, view angle, view point and view direction are synonyms.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The image data preparing section <b>17</b> prepares a plurality of three-dimensional image data (u, v, t) <b>3</b>D including temporal elements t for the plurality of view angles as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> from the four-dimensional image data <b>4</b>D. Three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D include image data of a two-dimensional space (u, v) and temporal elements t. As a plurality of view angles F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>3</sub>, . . . , F<sub>j </sub>are selected and set by the view angle setting section <b>16</b>, the image data preparing section <b>17</b> prepares three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>1</sub>, <b>3</b>D<sub>2</sub>, <b>3</b>D<sub>3</sub>, . . . , <b>3</b>D<sub>j </sub>respectively for the plurality of view angles F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>3</sub>, . . . , F<sub>j</sub>. The three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>1</sub>, <b>3</b>D<sub>2</sub>, <b>3</b>D<sub>3</sub>, . . . , <b>3</b>D<sub>j </sub>are used to produce so many moving images of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>that moves in response to the heartbeat under the condition that the view angles F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>3</sub>, . . . , F<sub>j </sub>are fixed and set.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The display control section <b>18</b> displays the moving images of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>1</sub>, <b>3</b>D<sub>2</sub>, <b>3</b>D<sub>3</sub>, . . . , <b>3</b>D<sub>j </sub>of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>extending around and surrounding the beating heart that shows a heartbeat movement on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the monitor <b>20</b> under the condition that the view angles F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>3</sub>, . . . , F<sub>j </sub>are fixed. More specifically, the display control section <b>18</b> defines a plurality of windows W<sub>1</sub>, W<sub>2</sub>, W<sub>3</sub>, . . . , W<sub>j </sub>on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>and synoptically displays the three-dimensional images of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>1</sub>, <b>3</b>D<sub>2</sub>, <b>3</b>D<sub>3</sub>, . . . , <b>3</b>D<sub>j </sub>respectively in the windows W<sub>1</sub>, W<sub>2</sub>, W<sub>3</sub>, . . . , W<sub>j</sub>, synchronizing the time elements t of the three-dimensional image data, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As an example, the display control section <b>18</b> displays the related ones of RAO, LAO, CAU and CRA of each of the view angles F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>3</sub>, . . . , F<sub>j </sub>respectively at the left side, at the right side and at the lower side and at the upper side of each of the windows of the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows nine windows W<sub>1 </sub>through W<sub>9 </sub>formed on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a</i>. However, the number of view angles F<sub>1 </sub>through F<sub>j </sub>that is selected and set is not limited to nine and depends on the view angles that are frequently selected for intravascular interventions in the hospital, which may typically be about ten. Thus, the nine windows W<sub>1 </sub>through W<sub>9 </sub>are assigned respectively to the selected view angles F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>3</sub>, . . . , F<sub>j</sub>. Therefore, moving images of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>that moves in response to the heartbeat are displayed in the windows W<sub>1 </sub>through W<sub>9 </sub>under the condition that the corresponding view angles F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>3</sub>, . . . , F<sub>j </sub>are fixed and set.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The display control section <b>18</b> receives as input the electrocardiogram signal E of the object of examination <b>1</b> output from the electrocardiograph <b>22</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> and typically displays the electrocardiogram waveform at a corner of the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The program memory <b>14</b> stores the image display program to be executed by the main control section <b>12</b>.

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">On the other hand, the view angle setting section <b>16</b> receives the input given to the operation section <b>19</b> by the surgeon who is going to perform an intravascular intervention and selects and sets the view angles F<sub>1 </sub>through F<sub>j </sub>relative to the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the object of examination <b>1</b>. Note that the suffix j indicates each view angle. The number of view angles F<sub>1 </sub>through F<sub>j </sub>that is selected and set depends on the view angles that are frequently selected for intravascular interventions in the hospital, which may typically be about ten. The plurality of view angles F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>3</sub>, . . . , F<sub>j </sub>may be set as, for example, nine (j=9) fixed view angles including F<sub>1 </sub>(RAO 30&#xb0;, CRA 20&#xb0;), F<sub>2 </sub>(0&#xb0;, CRA 20&#xb0;), F<sub>3 </sub>(LAO 50&#xb0;, CRA 20&#xb0;), F<sub>4 </sub>(RAO 30&#xb0;, 0&#xb0;), F<sub>5 </sub>(0&#xb0;, 0&#xb0;), F<sub>6 </sub>(LAO 50&#xb0;, 0&#xb0;), F<sub>7 </sub>(RAO 30&#xb0;, CAU 30&#xb0;), F<sub>8 </sub>(0&#xb0;, CAU 30&#xb0;) and F<sub>9 </sub>(LAO 50&#xb0;, CAU 30&#xb0;).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Then, the image data preparing section <b>17</b> reads the four-dimensional image data <b>4</b>D from the image data storage section <b>13</b> and, at the same time, receives the nine (j=9) view angles F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>3</sub>, . . . , F<sub>9 </sub>that are fixed and set by the view angle setting section <b>16</b>.

<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The operation section <b>19</b> typically includes a mouse as switching operation section. As the mouse is operated for a click, the operation section <b>19</b> sends a moving image switching signal to the display control section <b>18</b> in response to the click.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The display control section <b>18</b> temporally sequentially displays the moving images of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>3</sub>, <b>3</b>D<sub>4</sub>, . . . , <b>3</b>D<sub>9 </sub>for the view angles F<sub>3</sub>, F<sub>4</sub>, . . . , F<sub>9 </sub>that show the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>moving in response to a heartbeat under the condition that the view angles F<sub>1 </sub>through F<sub>9 </sub>are fixed, switching from a view angle to another. More specifically, the display control section <b>18</b> switches the display of the moving images of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>3</sub>, <b>3</b>D<sub>4</sub>, . . . , <b>3</b>D<sub>9 </sub>from one to another each time it receives a moving image switching signal. It may be so arranged that the display control section <b>18</b> automatically switches the display of the moving images of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>3</sub>, <b>3</b>D<sub>4</sub>, . . . , <b>3</b>D<sub>9 </sub>after showing a moving image for a predetermined time period, for example the time period of a heartbeat.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The program memory <b>14</b> stores an image display program to be executed by the main control section <b>12</b>. The image display program is adapted to temporally sequentially display the moving images of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>3</sub>, <b>3</b>D<sub>4</sub>, . . . , <b>3</b>D<sub>9 </sub>for the view angles F<sub>3</sub>, F<sub>4</sub>, . . . , F<sub>9 </sub>on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>in a switched manner under the condition that the view angles F<sub>1 </sub>through F<sub>j </sub>are fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Now, the image display operation of the apparatus of the second embodiment having the above-described configuration will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The medical equipment <b>11</b> images an object of examination <b>1</b> such as the coronary arteries <b>1</b><i>a </i>extending around and surrounding a heart showing a heartbeat movement and acquires image data on the object. The four-dimensional data structuring section <b>15</b> receives the image data on the object of examination <b>1</b> acquired by the medical equipment <b>11</b> and structures four-dimensional image data (x, y, z, t) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> from the image data.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">On the other hand, the view angle setting section <b>16</b> receives the operation input of the operation section by the surgeon who performs an intravascular intervention and selects and sets a plurality of view angles F<sub>1 </sub>through F<sub>j </sub>relative to the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a</i>, or the object of examination <b>1</b>. The plurality of view angles F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>3</sub>, . . . , F<sub>j </sub>are set, for example, as nine (j=9) fixed view angles including F<sub>1 </sub>(RAO 30&#xb0;, CRA 20&#xb0;), F<sub>2 </sub>(0&#xb0;, CRA 20&#xb0;), F<sub>3 </sub>(LAO 50&#xb0;, CRA 20&#xb0;), F<sub>4 </sub>(RAO 30&#xb0;, 0&#xb0;), F<sub>5 </sub>(0&#xb0;, 0&#xb0;), F<sub>6 </sub>(LAO 50&#xb0;, 0&#xb0;), F<sub>7 </sub>(RAO 30&#xb0;, CAU 30), F<sub>8 </sub>(0&#xb0;, CAU 30) and F<sub>9 </sub>(LAO 50&#xb0;, CAU 30&#xb0;).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Then, the image data preparing section <b>17</b> temporally sequentially displays the moving images of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>1</sub>, <b>3</b>D<sub>2</sub>, <b>3</b>D<sub>3</sub>, . . . , <b>3</b>D<sub>9 </sub>for the view angles F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>3</sub>, . . . , F<sub>9 </sub>in a switched manner according to the three-dimensional image data preparing flowchart illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. More specifically, in Step #<b>1</b>, the image data preparing section <b>17</b> sequentially reads the four-dimensional image data <b>4</b>D (x, y, z/t=i<sub>1</sub>) of a cardiac phase i<sub>k </sub>(k=1, 2, 3, . . . , m) from the image data storage section <b>13</b>. In Step #<b>2</b>, the image data preparing section <b>17</b> reads view angle F<sub>j</sub>=1, for example, from the view angle setting section <b>16</b>. Then, in Step #<b>3</b>, the image data preparing section <b>17</b> prepares projection image data of the image obtained by projecting in the view angle F<sub>1 </sub>from the image data it reads.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In Step #<b>3</b>, the image data preparing section <b>17</b> prepares projection image data (u, v/t=i<sub>1</sub>) of a single image obtained by projecting in the view angle F<sub>1 </sub>from the four-dimensional image data <b>4</b>D (x, y, z/t=i<sub>1</sub>) of a cardiac phase i<sub>1 </sub>read for the view angle F<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Then, in Step #<b>10</b>, the image data preparing section <b>17</b> determines if projection image data (u, v/t=i<sub>1 </sub>through <sub>m</sub>) of all the cardiac phases i<sub>k </sub>(k=1, 2, 3, . . . , m) are prepared for the view angle F<sub>1 </sub>or not. In other words, the image data preparing section <b>17</b> determines if the number of projection images for the view angle F<sub>1 </sub>gets to the value necessary for forming a moving image or not. If the object of examination <b>1</b> is a coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a</i>, the number of projection images necessary for forming a moving image is the number of projection image necessary for continuously displaying a single heartbeat as a moving image as described above for the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">When the number of projection images of the prepared projection image data gets to the value necessary for continuously displaying a heartbeat as a moving image, the image data preparing section <b>17</b> completes the operation of preparing three-dimensional moving images of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>1 </sub>for the view angle F<sub>1</sub>. In other words, the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>1 </sub>are formed by image data of a two-dimensional space (u, v) and temporal elements t (=i<sub>1</sub>, <sub>2</sub>, <sub>3</sub>, . . . , <sub>m</sub>). The image of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>1 </sub>is a moving image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>that moves in response to a single heartbeat for the fixed view angle F<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In Step #<b>20</b>, the image data preparing section <b>17</b> sends the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>1 </sub>to the display control section <b>18</b>. The display control section <b>18</b> displays the moving image of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>1 </sub>for the view angle F<sub>1 </sub>on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>1 </sub>displays a moving image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>that moves in response to a heartbeat under the condition that the view angle F<sub>1 </sub>is fixed. The arrows in the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> indicate the moving directions of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>that moves in response to the heartbeat.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In Step #<b>21</b>, the image data preparing section <b>17</b> determines if the mouse of the operation section <b>19</b> is left- or right-clicked or not under this condition. If the mouse is left-clicked, the image data preparing section <b>17</b> moves to Step #<b>22</b>, where it increments the suffix of the view angle F<sub>j </sub>by &#x201c;1&#x201d; and returns to Step #<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Then, the image data preparing section <b>17</b> repeats Steps #<b>1</b> through #<b>3</b>, #<b>10</b> and #<b>20</b> to sequentially read the four-dimensional image data <b>4</b>D (x, y, z/t=i<sub>1</sub>) for a cardiac phase i<sub>k </sub>(k=1, 2, 3, . . . , m) from the image data storage section <b>13</b> and also the view angle F<sub>j=2 </sub>from the view angle setting section <b>16</b> and prepare a moving image of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>2 </sub>for the view angle F<sub>2 </sub>in a manner as described above. Then, the image data preparing section <b>17</b> sends the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>2 </sub>to the display control section <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The display control section <b>18</b> switches the moving image on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>from that of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>1 </sub>for the view angle F<sub>1 </sub>to that of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>2 </sub>for the view angle F<sub>2 </sub>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>2 </sub>displays a moving image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>that moves in response to a heartbeat under the condition that the view angle F<sub>2 </sub>is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Thereafter, as the mouse is left-clicked under the condition that the moving image of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>2 </sub>for the view angle F<sub>2 </sub>is displayed, the image data preparing section <b>17</b> moves to Step #<b>22</b>, where it increments the view angle F<sub>j </sub>by &#x201c;1&#x201d;, and then returns to Step #<b>2</b>. Then, the image data preparing section <b>17</b> repeats Steps #<b>1</b> through #<b>3</b>, #<b>10</b> and #<b>20</b> and prepares a moving image of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>3 </sub>for the view angle F<sub>3</sub>. Then, the display control section <b>18</b> switches the moving image on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>from that of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>2 </sub>for the view angle F<sub>2 </sub>to that of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>3 </sub>for the view angle F<sub>3 </sub>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Thus, each time the mouse is left-clicked, the moving image that is displayed on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>is switched to that of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>4 </sub>for the view angle F<sub>4</sub>, that of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>5</sub>, . . . , for the view angle F<sub>5</sub>, that of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>9 </sub>for the view angle F<sub>9 </sub>and that of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">If, on the other hand, it is determined in Step #<b>21</b> that the mouse of the operation section <b>19</b> is right-clicked, the image data preparing section <b>17</b> moves to Step #<b>23</b>, where it determines that the view angle F<sub>j </sub>of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>j </sub>of the moving image that is being displayed on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>at the time when the mouse is right-clicked is an optimal view angle. If, for instance, the moving image of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>1 </sub>for the view angle F<sub>1 </sub>is being displayed on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>at the time when the mouse is right-clicked, the image data preparing section <b>17</b> determines that the view angle F<sub>1 </sub>is an optimal view angle.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Then, the main control section <b>12</b> stores the view angle F<sub>1 </sub>that is determined as optimal view angle (RAO 30&#xb0;, CRA 20&#xb0;) in a memory such as RAM and also transmits it to the medical equipment <b>11</b>. The medical equipment <b>11</b> then drives the C arm to rotate in the above-described manner in order to move the X-ray source and the X-ray detector to respective positions that correspond to the view angle F<sub>1</sub>(RAO 30&#xb0;, CRA 20&#xb0;). As a result, it is possible to acquire a moving image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>produced by imaging the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>from the view angle F<sub>1 </sub>(RAO 30&#xb0;, CRA 20&#xb0;) optimal for the intravascular intervention.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Thus, with the above-described second embodiment, each time the mouse is left-clicked, the moving image that is displayed on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>is switched to that of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>1 </sub>for the view angle F<sub>1</sub>, that of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>2 </sub>for the view angle F<sub>2</sub>, . . . , that of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>9 </sub>for the view angle F<sub>9 </sub>and that of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>1</sub>. It will be clear that this embodiment provides advantages similar to those of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">As described above, the moving image that is displayed on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>is switched to that of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>1 </sub>for the view angle F<sub>1</sub>, that of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>2 </sub>for the view angle F<sub>2</sub>, . . . , that of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>9 </sub>for the view angle F<sub>9 </sub>and that of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>1 </sub>each time the mouse is left-clicked in the second embodiment. However, the present invention is by no means limited to such an arrangement. For example, it may alternatively be so arranged that a switching icon is displayed on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>and a pointer P is arranged on the icon so that, each time the mouse is left-clicked, the moving image that is displayed on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>is switched to that of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>1 </sub>for the view angle F<sub>1</sub>, that of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>2 </sub>for the view angle F<sub>2</sub>, . . . , that of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>9 </sub>for the view angle F<sub>9 </sub>and that of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>1</sub>. Still alternatively, a keyboard, a touch panel or a joystick may be used for switching the moving image.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In the above-described second embodiment, each time the mouse is left-clicked, the image data preparing section <b>17</b> reads the four-dimensional image data <b>4</b>D (x, y, z/t=i<sub>1</sub>) of a cardiac phase i<sub>k </sub>(k=1, 2, 3, . . . , m) from the image data storage section <b>13</b> and also a view angle F<sub>j </sub>from the view angle setting section <b>16</b> to prepare a moving image of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>2 </sub>for the view angle F<sub>2</sub>. However, the present invention is by no means limited to such an arrangement. It may alternatively be so arranged that moving images of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>1</sub>, <b>3</b>D<sub>2</sub>, <b>3</b>D<sub>3</sub>, . . . , <b>3</b>D<sub>9 </sub>for all the view angles F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>3</sub>, . . . , F<sub>9 </sub>are prepared in advance in the background and stored in the image data storage section <b>13</b> so that the moving image of the three-dimensional image data <b>3</b>D<sub>1</sub>, <b>3</b>D<sub>2</sub>, <b>3</b>D<sub>3</sub>, . . . , or <b>3</b>D<sub>9 </sub>is read out and displayed on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>each time the mouse is left-clicked.</p>

With the first method of displaying color information, the apparent quantity of movement of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>running around the heart due to the heartbeat and hence the quantity of movement on the projection plane R in the u-v directions as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is displayed in color. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates that the quantity of movement of a spot on the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>due to the heartbeat is expressed typically by means of red, blue and pink. However, in reality, the quantity of movement of all the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>that is the total of the spots on the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is expressed in color. If, for example, the apparent quantity of movement of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is greater than a first predetermined quantity of movement, the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is displayed in red. If, to the contrary, the apparent quantity of movement of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is smaller than the first predetermined rate of movement, the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is displayed in blue. Then, it will be clear that the use of angle &#x3b8; that is close to the blue color is preferable. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates the relationship between angle &#x3b8; and color information.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">Now, the apparent movement of the coronary artery <b>1</b> running around the heart due to the heartbeat will be described below in terms of the first color information display method by using three-dimensional image data <b>4</b>D (x, y, z, t) as example. Assume that the image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>displayed on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>is that of the coronary artery in a final stage of expansion of cardiac phase. Alternatively, the image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>displayed on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>may be that of the coronary artery in a final stage of contraction of cardiac phase.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the branching part of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>moves with time in response to the heartbeat. Thus, when the branching part of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is projected onto the projection plane (u-v plane) R, it moves in the u-v directions on the projection plane R. La in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> denotes the projection line on the projection plane R of the branching part of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>in end-diastolic phase. Ha in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> denotes the locus of movement of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>on the projection line L<b>1</b> in the four-dimensional space. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> denotes the locus of movement of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>on the projection plane R. Thus, the largest value (number of pixels) of amplitude in the projection plane R is defined as the apparent quantity of movement M of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>in the projection plane R.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">With the second color information display method, the changing rate of the foreshortening of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>when the view angle is displaced from an optimal view angle, or the changing rate of the length of the vector G in the w-direction relative to the projection plane R as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, is displayed in color. If, for example, the changing rate of the length of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is greater than a predetermined second quantity of movement, the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>will be displayed in red. If, to the contrary, the changing rate of the length of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is smaller than the second predetermined rate of movement, the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is displayed in blue. Then, it will be clear that the use of angle &#x3b8; that is close to the blue color is preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The changing rate of foreshortening of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>will be described below for the second color information display method by using a stenotic part <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>in four-dimensional image data <b>4</b>D (x, y, z, t) as an example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A and 20B</figref>. The stenotic part <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is not changed by a heartbeat movement. On the other hand, the apparent stenotic length of the stenotic part <b>1</b><i>b </i>on the projection plane R is changed by a heartbeat movement. Thus, the changing rate of foreshortening is determined as the ratio of the length A in a cardiac phase where the length of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>on the projection plane R appears longest to the length B in a cardiac phase where the length of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>on the projection plane R appears shortest, or B/A. If the changing rate B/A of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is greater than the predetermined second quantity of movement, the stenotic part <b>1</b><i>b </i>is, for example, displayed in red. On the other hand, if the changing rate B/A of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is smaller than the predetermined second quantity of movement, the stenotic part <b>1</b><i>b </i>is, for example, displayed in blue.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">The image display apparatus main body <b>10</b> includes a color information setting section <b>40</b>, a vector conversion section <b>41</b>, a quantity of movement computing section <b>42</b> and a color information converting section <b>43</b>.

<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Thus, with the first color information display method, for example, the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is displayed in red when the apparent quantity of movement of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is greater than the first predetermined quantity of movement, whereas it is displayed in blue when the apparent quantity of movement of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is smaller than the first predetermined quantity of movement.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">With the second color information display method, for example, the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is displayed in red when the changing rate of the length of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is greater than the second predetermined quantity of movement, whereas it is displayed in blue when the changing rate of the length of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is smaller than the second predetermined quantity of movement. It should be noted, however, that color information selected and set by the color information setting section <b>40</b> is not limited to red and blue and a gray scale or a technique of changing the hatch density may alternatively be used.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">The vector conversion section <b>41</b> converts the movement of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>in a three-dimensional space due to the heartbeat movement into a three-dimensional movement vector G from the four-dimensional image data <b>4</b>D (x, y, z, t) of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>

When the second color information display method is employed, the quantity of movement computing section <b>42</b> computationally determines the changing rate of the length of the vector G in the w-direction on the projection plane R.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">If the first color information display method is employed, the color information converting section <b>43</b> converts the two-dimensional quantity of movement of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>into color information that corresponds to the apparent quantity of movement M of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0191" num="0190">The program memory <b>14</b> stores the image display program to be executed by the main control section <b>12</b>.

<p id="p-0192" num="0191">Now, the image display operation of the apparatus of the fourth embodiment having the above-described configuration will be described below by referring to the three-dimensional image data preparing flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">The medical equipment <b>11</b> images an object of examination <b>1</b> such as the coronary arteries <b>1</b><i>a </i>extending around and surrounding a heart showing a heartbeat movement and acquires image data on the object.

<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Then in Step #<b>40</b>, the image data preparing section <b>31</b> reads the cardiac phase i<sub>k </sub>that corresponds to a final stage of expansion of the heart set by the phase setting section <b>30</b>.

<p id="p-0196" num="0195">Then in Step #<b>42</b>, the image data preparing section <b>31</b> determines if it reads the four-dimensional image data <b>4</b>D (x, y, z, t) of all the cardiac phases i<sub>k </sub>set by the phase setting section <b>30</b> or not.

<p id="p-0199" num="0198">If the first color information display method is employed, the quantity of movement computing section <b>42</b> computationally determines the two-dimensional quantity of movement M of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>in a two-dimensional plane on the projection plane R where the three-dimensional movement vector G is projected in Step #<b>45</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.

<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Then in Step #<b>43</b>, the image data preparing section <b>31</b> prepares three-dimensional image data (r, s, i<sub>k</sub>) <b>3</b>D<sub>k </sub>of the movement of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>projected onto the projection plane R when the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is shifted, for example, as RAO 0 CRA 0&#x2192;RAO 30&#xb0; CRA 0&#x2192;RAO 30&#xb0; CAU 30&#xb0;&#x2192;RAO 0 CAU 30&#xb0;&#x2192;LAO 30&#xb0; CAU 30&#xb0;&#x2192;LAO 30&#xb0; CRA 30&#xb0;&#x2192;RAO 30&#xb0; CRA 30&#xb0;&#x2192;RAO 30&#xb0; CRA 0 in a cardiac phase i<sub>k </sub>that corresponds to a final stage of expansion of the heart as in the case of the above described third embodiment.

<p id="p-0202" num="0201">A technique of three-dimensionally displaying a blood vessel such as a coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>(coronary 3D, coronary tree) from X-ray images in two directions as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> is employed when determining a optimal view angle for intravascular intervention. With the technique of three-dimensionally displaying a blood vessel, three-dimensional coordinates are computationally determined in the course of computations. When four-dimensional image data are computed for a plurality of cardiac phases, three-dimensional coordinates are computationally determined in the course of computations. Thus, with the technique of three-dimensionally displaying a blood vessel, it is possible to determine four-dimensional coordinates and hence the locus Ha of movement of a coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>on projection line La in a four-dimensional space as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">With the technique of three-dimensionally displaying a blood vessel, the position of a coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>in a three-dimensional space is determined as the surgeon who is going to perform an intravascular intervention manually points it on Frontal image <b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>. In other words, it is necessary to specify the coordinates of a point on Frontal image <b>2</b> and those of the corresponding point on Lateral image <b>3</b>. With this arrangement, it is possible to find out the three-dimensional coordinates of a stenotic part of a coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>as the surgeon who is going to perform an intravascular intervention points the stenotic part of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>as corresponding point. Generally, the surgeon points a plurality of corresponding points (characteristic points) on coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a</i>. The number will typically be about 3 to 10. Then, corresponding points are linearly selected between those characteristic points. As a result, it is possible to find out the three-dimensional coordinates of all the points on the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>by means of the characteristic points and the corresponding points.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">The medical equipment <b>11</b> may typically be an X-ray apparatus, an X-ray CT apparatus, an MRI apparatus, a PET apparatus, a SPECT apparatus, a US apparatus, an IVUS apparatus or an X-ray diagnostic apparatus. However, unlike the technique of three-dimensionally displaying a blood vessel, it is not possible to acquire coordinate information from the data restructured by an X-ray CT apparatus or an MRI apparatus. If such is the case, characteristic points are selected on three-dimensional image data and points that resemble such characteristic points are searched for on the corresponding four-dimensional image data to determine the locus of movement in a four-dimensional space.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">The image data preparing section <b>31</b> receives the apparent quantity of movement M of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>when the first color information display method is used or the changing rate of the length of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>when the first color information display method from the color information converting section <b>43</b> is employed. Then, the image data preparing section <b>31</b> adds color information to the three-dimensional image data (r, s, i<sub>k</sub>) <b>3</b>D<sub>k</sub>. The position on the three-dimensional image data (r, s, i<sub>k</sub>) <b>3</b>D<sub>k </sub>where color information is added is the position of the coordinates of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>that corresponds to the quantity of movement M of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>or the changing rate of the length of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a. </i></p>

<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Then, the display control section <b>18</b> displays a window W<sub>20 </sub>typically as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the monitor <b>20</b>.

At this time, the color of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>displayed on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>changes according to the apparent quantity of movement M of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>when the first color information display method is used or the changing rate of the length of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>when the second color information display method is used.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">With the first color information display method, the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is displayed in red when the apparent quantity of movement M of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is greater than a predetermined first quantity of movement, whereas it is displayed in blue when the apparent quantity of movement M of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is smaller than the predetermined first quantity of movement.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">With the second color information display method, on the other hand, the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is displayed in red when the changing rate of the length of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is greater than a predetermined second quantity of movement, whereas it is displayed in blue when the changing rate of the length of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is smaller than the predetermined second quantity of movement.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">Note that, while the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is displayed partly in red or blue for the sake of convenience of illustration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the apparent quantity of movement M or the changing rate of the length of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>varies from part to part in reality. Therefore, the display color of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>may vary from part to part depending on the apparent quantity of movement M or the changing rate of the length of each part of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the each part of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>may be displayed in red, yellow, blue, green, brown or some other color depending on the apparent quantity of movement M or the changing rate of the length of the part.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">Then in Step #<b>8</b>, the display control section <b>32</b> determines which view angle F<sub>j </sub>is selected by clicking the mouse of the operation section <b>19</b>.

<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Thereafter, the main control section <b>12</b> stores the view angle RAO 30&#xb0; CAU 30&#xb0; that is determined as optimal view angle in a memory such as RAM and also transmits it to the medical equipment <b>11</b>. The medical equipment <b>11</b> drives the C arm to rotate in the above described manner in order to move the X-ray source and the X-ray detector to respective positions that correspond to the view angle RAO 30&#xb0; CAU 30&#xb0;.

<p id="p-0213" num="0212">After the operation in Step #<b>47</b>, the image data preparing section <b>31</b> may move to Steps #<b>48</b>, #<b>49</b> to display the moving images of the coronary artery al in all the cardiac phases i<sub>k </sub>as synopsis.

<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Thus, the above-described fourth embodiment selects and sets a plurality of pieces of color information for indicating the quantity of movement of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>that corresponds to the heartbeat and displays the color information that corresponds to the quantity of movement of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a</i>, while shifting the view angle F<sub>j </sub>relative to the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>in the image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>that is being displayed on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0216" num="0215">The coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>can be displayed not only in the cardiac phase corresponding to a final stage of expansion of the heart but also in cardiac phases of 0%, 20%, 40%, 60% and 80%, while shifting the view angle F<sub>j </sub>relative to the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a</i>. Then, it is possible to see the movement of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>by way of the color information of red color and/or blue color, for instance. Thus, it is possible to see the overall movement of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>simply by seeing the displayed image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">While a plurality of pieces of color information are selected and set so as to correspond to different quantities of movement of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>that takes place in response to a heartbeat in the above described fourth embodiment, pieces of color information may be so selected and set as to correspond to moving directions (x, y, z) of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">Now, the fifth embodiment of the present invention will be described below by referring to the related ones of the accompanying drawings. Note that the components same as those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 10</figref> are denoted respectively by the same reference symbols and will not be described any further.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a schematic block diagram of the image display apparatus of this embodiment. The image display apparatus main body <b>10</b> includes an image data preparing section <b>50</b> and a display control section <b>51</b>. The image data preparing section <b>50</b> and the display control section <b>51</b> operate according to the respective commands issued from the main control section <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">The operation section <b>52</b> typically includes a mouse. Each time the mouse is clicked, the operation section <b>52</b> switches the image data prepared by the image data preparing section <b>50</b>, which are the three-dimensional image data (u, v, t) for forming a moving image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>that moves in response to the heartbeat under the condition that the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is fixed and set to the three-dimensional image data (r, s, t) for forming a moving image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>that is observed when the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is shifted relative to the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>under the condition that the heartbeat movement is fixed and vice versa and outputs a switching operation signal for displaying the moving images in a switched manner.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">Each time the image data preparing section <b>50</b> receives a switching operation signal output from the operation section <b>52</b>, it prepares the first three-dimensional image data (u, v, t) for forming an moving image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>that moves in response to the heartbeat under the condition that the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is fixed and set from the four-dimensional image data <b>4</b>D (x, y, z, t). Additionally, each time the image data preparing section <b>50</b> receives a switching operation signal output from the operation section <b>52</b>, it prepares the second three-dimensional image data (r, s, t) for forming a moving image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>that is produced by shifting the view angle F<sub>j </sub>relative to the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>under the condition that the heartbeat is fixed from the four-dimensional image data <b>4</b>D (x, y, z, t).</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">Each time the display control section <b>51</b> receives a switching operation signal output from the operation section <b>52</b>, it displays the moving image of the first three-dimensional image data (u, v, t) or the moving image of the second three-dimensional image data (r, s, t) prepared by the image data preparing section <b>50</b> in a switched manner.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">The program memory <b>14</b> stores the image data program to be executed by the main control section <b>12</b>. Each time the image display program receives a switching operation signal output from the operation section <b>52</b>, it causes the image data apparatus to display the moving image of the first three-dimensional image data (u, v, t) showing the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>that moves in response to the heartbeat under the condition that the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is fixed and set or the moving image of the second three-dimensional image data (r, s, t) produced by shifting the view angle F<sub>j </sub>relative to the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>under the condition that the heartbeat is fixed in a switched manner.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">Now, the operation of the apparatus of the fifth embodiment of the present invention will be described below by referring to the three-dimensional image data preparing flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">The medical equipment <b>11</b> images an object of examination <b>1</b> such as the coronary arteries <b>1</b><i>a </i>extending around and surrounding a heart showing a heartbeat movement and acquires image data on the object. The four-dimensional data structuring section <b>15</b> receives the image data on the object of examination <b>1</b> acquired by the medical equipment <b>11</b> and structures four-dimensional image data (x, y, z, t) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> from the image data.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">Each time the image data preparing section <b>50</b> receives a switching operation signal output from the operation section <b>52</b>, it prepares the first three-dimensional image data (u, v, t) for forming a moving image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>that moves in response to the heartbeat under the condition that the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is fixed and set from the four-dimensional image data <b>4</b>D (x, y, z, t).</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">Additionally, each time the image data preparing section <b>50</b> receives a switching operation signal output from the operation section <b>52</b>, it prepares the second three-dimensional image data (r, s, t) for forming a moving image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>produced by shifting the view angle F<sub>j </sub>relative to the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>under the condition where the heartbeat is fixed from the four-dimensional image data <b>4</b>D (x, y, z, t).</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">More specifically, in Step #<b>50</b>, the image data preparing section <b>50</b> prepares the second three-dimensional image data (r, s, t) for forming a moving image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>produced by shifting the view angle F<sub>j </sub>relative to the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>under the condition that the heartbeat is fixed and hence the cardiac phase is fixed. The display control section <b>51</b> then displays the moving image of the second three-dimensional image data (r, s, t) obtained by shifting the view angle F<sub>j </sub>under the condition that the heartbeat is fixed as indicated by display condition Q<sub>1 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> schematically illustrates a moving image of the second three-dimensional image data (r, s, t) produced by shifting the view angle F<sub>j </sub>relative to the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>under the condition that the cardiac phase i<sub>k </sub>is fixed. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the arrows indicate that the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>rotates when the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is shifted successively from F<sub>10 </sub>to F<sub>11 </sub>and F<sub>12</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">As the surgeon who is going to perform an intravascular intervention clicks the mouse of the operation section <b>52</b> under this condition, the operation section <b>52</b> outputs a switching operation signal for switching the image being displayed on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>in Step #<b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">As the image data preparing section <b>50</b> receives the switching operation signal output from the operation section <b>52</b> in Step #<b>52</b>, it switches from preparation of the second three-dimensional image data (r, s, t) for the moving image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>produced by shifting the view angle F<sub>j </sub>relative to the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>under the condition that the cardiac phase i<sub>k </sub>is fixed to preparation of the first three-dimensional image data (u, v, t) for the moving image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>moving in response to the heartbeat under the condition that the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is fixed and set.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">If the click operation is conducted at time T<sub>1 </sub>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> and the view angle F<sub>j </sub>of the second three-dimensional image data (r, s, t) is F<sub>10 </sub>at that time, the image data preparing section <b>50</b> prepares the first three-dimensional image data (u, v, t) for the moving image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>moving in response to the heartbeat under the condition that the view angle F<sub>10 </sub>is fixed and set.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">Then, the display control section <b>51</b> displays the moving image of the first three-dimensional image data (u, v, t) prepared by the image data preparing section <b>50</b> on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>under the display condition as illustrated in Q<sub>2 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. The moving image of the first three-dimensional image data (u, v, t) may be that of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>moving in response to the heartbeat under the condition that the view angle F<sub>10 </sub>is fixed and set as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. The arrows in the windows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> indicate the directions in which the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>moves.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">As the surgeon who is going to perform an intravascular intervention clicks the mouse of the operation section <b>52</b> once again under this condition, the operation section <b>52</b> outputs a switching operation signal for the image being displayed on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>in Step #<b>53</b>. Assume that the click operation is performed at time T<sub>2 </sub>and the moving image of the second three-dimensional image data (r, s, t) obtained from the view angle F<sub>10 </sub>is being displayed on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">Then, the image data preparing section <b>50</b> returns to Step #<b>50</b>, where it prepares the second three-dimensional image data (r, s, t) of the moving image obtained when the view angle F<sub>j </sub>relative to the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is shifted successively from F<sub>10 </sub>to F<sub>11 </sub>and F<sub>12 </sub>under the condition that the cardiac phase i<sub>k </sub>is fixed. Then, the display control section <b>51</b> displays the moving image of the second three-dimensional image data (r, s, t) produced by successively shifting the view angle F<sub>j </sub>from F<sub>10 </sub>to F<sub>11 </sub>and F<sub>12 </sub>under the condition that the heartbeat movement is fixed as indicated by the display condition Q<sub>3 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">Thereafter, each time the mouse is clicked, the moving image of the first three-dimensional image data (u, v, t) of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>moving in response to the heartbeat under the condition that the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is fixed is switched to the moving image of the second three-dimensional image data (r, s, t) of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>produced by shifting the view angle relative to the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>under the condition that the cardiac phase i<sub>k </sub>is fixed or vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">If the surgeon who is going to perform an intravascular intervention makes right mouse click while the moving image of the first three-dimensional image data (u, v, t) of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>moving in response to the heartbeat under the condition that the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is fixed to F<sub>10 </sub>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the display control section <b>51</b> determines that the view angle F<sub>10 </sub>of the first three-dimensional image data (u, v, t) of the moving image being displayed on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a </i>is an optimal view angle in Step #<b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">Thus, the fifth embodiment displays the moving image of the first three-dimensional image data (u, v, t) of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>moving in response to the heartbeat under the condition that the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is fixed or the moving image of the second three-dimensional image data (r, s, t) of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>produced by shifting the view angle F<sub>j </sub>relative to the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>under the condition that the cardiac phase i<sub>k </sub>is fixed in a switched manner each time the mouse is clicked. Then, it is possible to determine an optimal view angle for an intravascular intervention from the moving image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>moving in response to the heartbeat under the condition that the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is fixed and the moving image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>produced by shifting the view angle F<sub>j </sub>relative to the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>under the condition that the heartbeat movement is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">While the above-described fifth embodiment switches the display of the moving image of the three-dimensional image data (u, v, t) to that of the moving image of the three-dimensional image data (r, s, t) or vice versa by way of a click operation of the mouse, the present invention is by no means limited thereto. It may alternatively be so arranged that the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is displayed while the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is being shifted when the mouse is pushed down but the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>that is moving in response to the heartbeat is displayed while the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is fixed when the mouse is not pushed down.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">Still alternatively, it may be so arranged that the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>that is moving in response to the heartbeat is displayed while the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is fixed when the mouse is pushed down but the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is displayed while the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is being shifted when the mouse is not pushed down. Still alternatively, it may be so arranged that the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is displayed while the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is being shifted when the mouse is left-clicked but the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>that is moving in response to the heartbeat is displayed while the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is fixed when the mouse is right-clicked and either the moving image of the three-dimensional image data (u, v, t) or that of the three-dimensional image data (r, s, t), whichever appropriate, is made still when the mouse is not clicked at either side.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">A joystick may alternatively be used. It may be so arranged that the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is shifted in response to an operation of shifting the angle of tilting the joystick when displaying the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is fixed to display the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>moving in response to the heartbeat in response to a button operation. With this arrangement, it is possible to determine the view angle by the direction in which the joystick is tilted.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">For switching from the three-dimensional image data (u, v, t) to the three-dimensional image data (r, s, t) or vice versa, it may be so arranged that the operation of displaying the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a</i>, shifting the view angle F<sub>j</sub>, is terminated when the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is turned by 360&#xb0; and switched to the operation of displaying the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>moving in response to the heartbeat under the condition that the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is fixed. It may alternatively be so arranged that the operation of displaying the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>moving in response to the heartbeat under the condition that the view angle F<sub>j </sub>is fixed is terminated when a heartbeat is completed and switched to the operation of displaying the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a</i>, shifting the view angle F<sub>j</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">With the technique of three-dimensionally displaying a blood vessel such as a coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>from X-ray images taken from two directions, it is difficult to see the detailed structure of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>due to the phenomenon of foreshortening where the apparent length of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is shortened. Therefore, according to the present invention, a moving image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>acquired by angiography is displayed on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a</i>. Then, one or more moving images acquired by one of the first through fifth embodiments are displayed synchronously with the display of the moving image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">For example, when the first embodiment is applied, moving images of a plurality of three-dimensional image data (u, v, t) <b>3</b>D showing how the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>moves in response to the heartbeat under the condition that the plurality of view angles F<sub>1 </sub>through F<sub>j </sub>are fixed are displayed synchronously with the moving image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>acquired by angiography.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">With such a display technique, it is possible to observe the detailed structure of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>from the moving image acquired by angiography. At the same time, it is possible to recognize the phenomenon of foreshortening where the apparent length of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>is shortened from the display of one or more moving images by means of one of the first through fifth embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">The above described fourth embodiment displays color information that corresponds to the quantity of movement of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a</i>, while shifting the view angle relative to the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a</i>. However, the present invention is by no means limited thereto and the first through third and the fifth embodiments may be adapted to display color information corresponding to the quantity of movement of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>on the image of the coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a </i>being displayed on the monitor screen <b>20</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">The above-described first through fifth embodiments are adapted to view a coronary artery <b>1</b><i>a</i>. However, the present invention is by no means limited thereto and they may be so adapted as to display the entire heart to determine an optimal view angle for a surgery operation. They may alternatively be so adapted to display an organ other than the heart to determine an optimal view angle for a surgery operation without being influenced by any movement attributable to breathing.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein.
