<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-036978, filed 16 Feb. 2007.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This relates to solid-state image pickup devices and methods.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The demand for image input image sensors, such as CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) image sensors or CCD (charge coupled device) image sensors, in the application fields of digital cameras and cellular phones equipped with cameras, has increased along with the performance improvement of such image sensors. Image sensors with improved performance characteristics are desired. One such characteristic is expansion of the dynamic range. For such image sensors, further improvement in characteristics is demanded, and one of the characteristics is the dynamic range that should be expanded.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Examples of solid-state image pickup devices designed for realizing a wider dynamic range are given in Japanese Kokai Patent Application No. 2003-134396, Japanese Kokai Patent Application No. 2000-165754, Japanese Kokai Patent Application No. 2002-77737, and Japanese Kokai Patent Application No. Hei 5[1993]-90556. However, for such solid-state image pickup devices, a wide dynamic range is difficult to realize while maintaining high sensitivity and a high S/N ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To address this problem, another type of solid-state image pickup device, shown in Japanese Kokai Patent Application No. 2005-328493, was developed. In that solid-state image pickup device, the structure is such that photoelectric charge overflowing from the photodiode of each pixel is stored in a floating diffusion and an electrostatic capacitive element. When photoelectric charge does not overflow from the photodiode, the photoelectric charge in the photodiode is used to obtain the signal of each pixel. On the other hand, when it overflows, the sum of the photoelectric charge in the photodiode and the photoelectric charge that has overflowed from the photodiode gives the signal of the pixel. When such solid-state image pickup device is manufactured using the CMOS process, however, the dark current component with respect to the photoelectric charge that has overflowed from such photodiode increases by about 3-4 orders of magnitude higher than the required level. Consequently, it is inappropriate for use for storage of photoelectric charge over a long period of time, and there is a demand for development of a scheme to suppress such dark current. For example, the sites of generation of the dark current component include the interface directly below the gate of the transistor, the side surface of the element separating insulating film, the portion of the silicon surface contacting the depletion layer, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2005/083790, Japanese Kokai Patent Application No. 2005-328493, and Japanese Kokai Patent Application No. 2006-217410 disclose solid-state image pickup devices that can suppress the dark current component and can expand the dynamic range while maintaining high sensitivity and a high S/N ratio. And, for these solid-state image pickup devices, efforts have been made to realize high sensitivity and a high S/N ratio especially in the low-luminance region.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The problem to be solved is how to realize high sensitivity and a high S/N ratio, especially in the low irradiation region, while maintaining a wide dynamic range.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention addressed the above problem.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of the invention provide a type of solid-state image pickup device with the following characteristics. The device has a plurality of pixels integrated in an array configuration on a semiconductor substrate. Each pixel has a photodiode which receives light and generates and stores photoelectric charge; a transfer transistor which transfers the photoelectric charge from the photodiode; a floating diffusion which transfers the photoelectric charge through the transfer transistor; an additive capacitive element which is connected via the floating diffusion to the photodiode, and which stores the photoelectric charge transferred through the transfer transistor from the photodiode; a capacitive coupling transistor which combines or divides the floating diffusion and the additive capacitive element; and a reset transistor which is connected to the additive capacitive element or the floating diffusion for exhausting the photoelectric charge from within the additive capacitive element and/or the floating diffusion; and the capacitance of the floating diffusion is smaller than that of such photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The solid-state image pickup device is formed by integrating plural pixels in an array configuration on a semiconductor substrate, with each pixel comprising a photodiode, a transfer transistor, a floating diffusion, an additive capacitive element, a capacitive coupling transistor, and a reset transistor. The photodiode receives light to generate photoelectric charge and store it. The transfer transistor transfers photoelectric charge from the photodiode. The floating diffusion transfers the photoelectric charge through the transfer transistor. The additive capacitive element is set connected via such floating diffusion to the photodiode, and it stores the photoelectric charge transferred from the photodiode via the transfer transistor. The capacitive coupling transistor combines or divides the floating diffusion and the additive capacitive element. The reset transistor is connected to the additive capacitive element or floating diffusion, and it exhausts the photoelectric charge in the additive capacitive element and/or such floating diffusion. Here, the structure is such that the capacitance of the floating diffusion is smaller than that of the photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The described solid-state image pickup device embodiments are preferably configured so that the sum of the capacitance of the floating diffusion and the capacitance of the additive capacitive element is larger than the capacitance of the photodiode. It is more preferred that the capacitance of such floating diffusion be smaller than the capacitance of such additive capacitive element.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Example embodiments for implementing principles of the invention are described below:</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">First Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The solid-state image pickup device pertaining to the present embodiment is a CMOS image sensor. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram illustrating one pixel PX (pixel).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For a so-called five-transistor type CMOS image sensor, each pixel includes the following elements: a photodiode PD which receives light and generates and stores photoelectric charge; a transfer transistor Tr<b>1</b> which transfers such photoelectric charge from such photodiode PD; a floating diffusion FD which transfers such photoelectric charge through such transfer transistor Tr<b>1</b>; an additive capacitive element Cs; a capacitive coupling transistor Tr<b>2</b> which combines or divides the capacitance of such floating diffusion FD and the capacitance of such additive capacitive element Cs; a reset transistor Tr<b>3</b> which is connected to floating diffusion FD and exhausts the photoelectric charge in floating diffusion FD; an amplifying transistor Tr<b>4</b> (source follower SF) that amplifies and converts the photoelectric charge in floating diffusion FD to a voltage signal; and a selecting transistor Tr<b>5</b> that is formed connected in series to the amplifying transistor and is for selecting the pixel. For example, such five transistors may all be n-channel MOS transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For the CMOS image sensor in this embodiment, pixels each having the aforementioned composition are integrated. In each pixel, driving lines of &#x3c6;T, &#x3c6;S and &#x3c6;R are connected to the gate electrodes of transfer transistor Tr<b>1</b>, capacitive coupling transistor Tr<b>2</b> and reset transistor Tr<b>3</b>, respectively. Also, pixel selecting line SL (&#x3c6;X) driven by a row shift transistor is connected to the gate electrode of selecting transistor Tr<b>5</b>. A prescribed voltage VR is applied to the source/drain of one of reset transistor Tr<b>3</b> and selecting transistor Tr<b>5</b>, and output line Vout is connected to the output-side source/drain of amplifying transistor Tr<b>4</b>, and a voltage signal controlled by the column shift register is output. For selecting transistor Tr<b>5</b> and driving line &#x3c6;X, the voltage of floating diffusion FD can be fixed at an appropriate level such that the selection/non-selection operation of a pixel can be performed. Consequently, they may also be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a layout diagram illustrating an example of a pixel (1 pixel) of the CMOS image sensor in the first embodiment. Photodiode PD, additive capacitive element Cs and the five transistors Tr<b>1</b>-Tr<b>5</b> are arranged as shown in the drawing; floating diffusion FD, between such transfer transistor Tr<b>1</b> (T) and the gate of capacitive coupling transistor Tr<b>2</b> (S), and amplifying transistor Tr<b>4</b> (Source follower SF) are connected to each other by wiring W<b>1</b>; and wiring of prescribed voltage VR is connected to the diffusion layer between reset transistor Tr<b>3</b> (R) and selecting transistor Tr<b>5</b> (X). In this way, a circuit corresponding to the equivalent circuit diagram in the present embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In this layout, the width of the channel of transfer transistor Tr<b>1</b> is formed wider on the side of photodiode PD, and narrower on the side of floating diffusion FD. Consequently, instant transfer of the photoelectric charge from the photodiode to the floating diffusion is possible. On the other hand, by having a narrower dimension on the side of floating diffusion FD, it is possible to reduce the capacitance of such floating diffusion FD, and it is possible to increase the variation width of the potential with respect to the charge stored in such floating diffusion FD.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In such configuration, the CMOS image sensor in the first embodiment has a configuration in which capacitance C<sub>FD </sub>of floating diffusion FD is smaller than capacitance C<sub>PD </sub>of photodiode PD. It is also preferred that the sum of capacitance C<sub>FD </sub>of floating diffusion FD and capacitance C<sub>S </sub>of the additive capacitive element be larger than capacitance C<sub>PD </sub>of the photodiode PD. Also, it is preferred that capacitance C<sub>FD </sub>of floating diffusion FD be smaller than capacitance C<sub>S </sub>of the additive capacitive element. Thus, the following conditions are met:

In this embodiment, for example, the additive capacitive element is formed from the capacitance of an impurity diffusion layer formed on the semiconductor substrate. Even when the additive capacitive element doesn't have a configuration with a pair of electrodes set facing each other via an insulating film, sufficient capacitance still can be realized. Of course, one may also adopt a scheme in which a pair of electrodes are set facing each other via an insulating film.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the following, an explanation will be given regarding control of the potential shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> according to the time chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">FIGS. <b>7</b>(A)-(H) correspond to the potential diagrams at the various timings of the time chart. First, photoelectric charge Q is stored in C<sub>PD </sub>during the storage period of one field. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(A)</figref>, during the storage period, &#x3c6;s and &#x3c6;R are turned ON, C<sub>FD </sub>and C<sub>S </sub>are coupled, and power source voltage VR is applied in this state. As &#x3c6;T becomes level &#x3b1;<b>1</b>, in the potential made of C<sub>FD</sub>+C<sub>S</sub>, the photoelectric charge that overflowed from C<sub>PD </sub>during the storage period is exhausted to power source voltage VR. Then, at the time immediately after completion of output period P<sub>OP </sub>of the preceding line, driving lines (&#x3c6;S<b>1</b>+N<b>1</b>, &#x3c6;N<b>1</b>, &#x3c6;S<b>1</b>&#x2032;+S<b>2</b>&#x2032;+N<b>2</b>, &#x3c6;N<b>2</b>) are turned ON, and, at the same time, driving line &#x3c6;XCLR is turned ON, and analog memory AM shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is cleared.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(B)</figref>, after completion of output period P<sub>OP </sub>of the preceding line, and at time T<sub>1 </sub>when horizontal blanking period P<sub>HB </sub>of the current line starts, &#x3c6;X is turned ON, and &#x3c6;R is turned OFF. When &#x3c6;R is turned OFF, so-called kTC noise is generated in the potential arranged of C<sub>FD</sub>+C<sub>S</sub>. Here, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, &#x3c6;N<b>2</b> is turned ON, and the signal of the reset level of C<sub>FD</sub>+C<sub>S </sub>is read as noise N<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(C)</figref>, at time T<sub>2</sub>, &#x3c6;S is turned OFF (&#x3b1;<b>2</b>). When &#x3c6;s is turned OFF, the potential composed of C<sub>FD</sub>+C<sub>S </sub>is divided into the potential of C<sub>FD </sub>and potential C<sub>S</sub>. Here, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, &#x3c6;N<b>1</b> is turned ON, and the signal of the reset level of C<sub>FD </sub>is read as noise N<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Then, at time T<sub>3</sub>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(D)</figref>, &#x3c6;T is turned ON, and a portion or the entirety of photoelectric charge Q stored in C<sub>PD </sub>is transferred to C<sub>FD</sub>.

Consequently, it is impossible to transfer the entirety of photoelectric charge Q. Instead, only a portion of the charge is transferred, while the residual portion is left in C<sub>PD</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(E)</figref>, at time T<sub>4</sub>, while such residual portion is left in C<sub>FD</sub>, &#x3c6;T is set back to the OFF state (&#x3b1;<b>1</b>). As a result, photoelectric charge Q is divided into portion Q<sub>A </sub>transferred to C<sub>FD </sub>and residual portion Q<sub>B </sub>left in C<sub>PD</sub>. Here, assuming that &#x3c6;S<b>1</b>+N<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is ON, as the first signal, signal S<sub>1 </sub>corresponding to such portion Q<sub>A </sub>of the photoelectric charge transferred to C<sub>FD </sub>is read.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the following, an explanation will be given regarding recovery of such modulated pre-saturation charge signal (S<sub>1&#x2032;</sub>)+modulated over-saturation charge signal (S<sub>2&#x2032;</sub>). Here, S<sub>1&#x2032;</sub>, S<sub>2&#x2032;</sub>, and &#x3b1; (charge distribution ratio of C<sub>FD </sub>to C<sub>FD</sub>+C<sub>S</sub>) are represented by the following numerical formula:

Then, one of such obtained S<sub>1 </sub>and S<sub>1</sub>+S<sub>2 </sub>is selected as the final output. Here, for example, when the first signal (pre-saturation charge signal (S<sub>1</sub>)) is lower than the saturated signal of floating diffusion C<sub>FD</sub>, such first signal is taken as the output of such pixel, and, when such first signal (pre-saturation charge signal (S<sub>1</sub>)) exceeds the saturated signal of floating diffusion C<sub>FD</sub>, the second signal (pre-saturation charge signal (S<sub>1</sub>)+over-saturated charge signal (S<sub>2</sub>)) is taken as the output of such pixel. For example, the selection of such first signal (pre-saturation charge signal (S<sub>1</sub>)) and second signal (pre-saturation charge signal (S<sub>1</sub>)+over-saturated charge signal (S<sub>2</sub>)) may be performed by inputting S<sub>1 </sub>into a comparator with such reference potential set there, and, by means of the comparison result, a selector or the like is used to select S<sub>1 </sub>or S<sub>1</sub>+S<sub>2</sub>.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In a CMOS image sensor with such configuration, the portion up to S<sub>1 </sub>or S<sub>1</sub>+S<sub>2 </sub>may be formed on the CMOS image sensor, or a circuit of a differential amplifier or the like with the portion until the output of pre-saturation charge signal (S<sub>1</sub>)+C<sub>FD </sub>noise (N<sub>1</sub>), C<sub>FD </sub>noise (N<sub>1</sub>), modulated pre-saturation charge signal (S<sub>1&#x2032;</sub>)+modulated over-saturation charge signal (S<sub>2&#x2032;</sub>)+C<sub>FD</sub>+C<sub>S </sub>noise (N<sub>2</sub>), and C<sub>FD</sub>+C<sub>S </sub>noise (N<sub>2</sub>) formed on the CMOS image sensor chip may be set out of the chip. For the CMOS image sensor of the present embodiment, capacitance C<sub>FD </sub>of floating diffusion FD is smaller than capacitance C<sub>PD </sub>of photodiode PD (C<sub>FD</sub>&#x3c;C<sub>PD</sub>), so the first signal (pre-satutation charge signal (S<sub>1</sub>)) is obtained by means of only the signal of the smaller C<sub>FD</sub>, and it is possible to realize higher sensitivity and a higher S/N ratio of the signal in the low-luminance region. In addition, because the sum of capacitance C<sub>FD </sub>of floating diffusion FD and capacitance C<sub>S </sub>of the additive capacitive element exceeds capacitance C<sub>PD </sub>of photodiode PD (C<sub>FD</sub>+C<sub>S</sub>&#x2267;C<sub>PD</sub>), the second signal (pre-saturation charge signal (S<sub>1</sub>)+over-saturated charge signal (S<sub>2</sub>)) is obtained. As a result, in addition to such low-luminance region, the high-luminance region corresponding to the saturated quantity of capacitance C<sub>PD </sub>of photodiode PD also can obtain a signal at high sensitivity, and a wider dynamic range can be realized. In particular, by capacitance C<sub>FD </sub>of floating diffusion FD being smaller than capacitance C<sub>S </sub>of the additive capacitive element (C<sub>FD</sub>&#x3c;C<sub>S</sub>), it is possible to further increase the sensitivity of the low-luminance region. For example, by selecting C<sub>FD </sub>to be 0.4 fF so as to be capable to detect a single electron, and selecting C<sub>FD</sub>:C<sub>S </sub>to be 1:7, it is possible to obtain a high sensitivity signal in the illumination region up to about 3-4 fF of C<sub>PD</sub>.</p>

Both signals have noise Nc, Nd until the level of fundamental floor noise BN rides on them. However, since noise Nd of output (d) of the first signal (pre-saturation charge signal (S<sub>1</sub>)) is not noise which Nc has amplified, it is possible to realize higher sensitivity and a higher S/N ratio for a signal corresponding to the low-luminance region.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The remaining circuit configuration and the read operating method are the same as those in the first embodiment. Just as in the first embodiment, for the CMOS image sensor of the fifth embodiment, it is possible to realize high sensitivity and a high S/N ratio especially in the low-luminance region, while maintaining a wide dynamic range. Also, just as in the first embodiment, for the operating method for the CMOS image sensor in the fifth embodiment, the solid-state image pickup device can operate such that high sensitivity and a high S/N ratio can be realized especially in the low-luminance region, while a wide dynamic range is maintained.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Sixth Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram illustrating a portion of 16 pixels of a CMOS image sensor (displayed with some portions not shown) as the solid-state image pickup device in a sixth embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, in the vertical direction (the V direction), lines <b>1</b>-<b>4</b> are set side-by-side, and, in the horizontal direction, columns <b>1</b>-<b>4</b> are set side-by-side. As a result, 16 pixels are set in this configuration. Also, transfer transistor T is set for each pixel. Here, every two pixels adjacent to each other in the vertical direction (the V direction) share capacitive coupling transistor S and an amplifying transistor (source follower SF). Along with this, every two pixels share floating diffusion FD. In addition, reset transistor R is shared by two capacitive coupling transistors S adjacent to each other in the vertical direction with each shared by two pixels. That is, such reset transistor is shared by four pixels adjacent to each other in the vertical direction. Here, such selecting transistor X is shared by four amplifying transistors (source followers SF) adjacent in the horizontal direction (the H direction), that is, it is shared by 8 pixels. The other features of the circuit configuration and the operating method for the read operation are the same as those in the fifth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the CMOS image sensor of the sixth embodiment, there are 38 transistors for every 16 pixels. Consequently, the number per pixel, can be cut to 2.375. Just as in the first embodiment, for the CMOS image sensor of the sixth embodiment, it is possible to realize high sensitivity and a high S/N ratio especially in the low-luminance region, while maintaining a wide dynamic range. Also, according to the sixth embodiment, because the pixels share such selecting transistor X on the side of the power source potential, it also displays a bootstrapping effect. Also, just as in the first embodiment, for the operating method for the CMOS image sensor in the sixth embodiment, the solid-state image pickup device can operate such that high sensitivity and a high S/N ratio can be realized especially in the low-luminance region, while a wide dynamic range is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the following, an explanation will be given regarding the characteristics of the CMOS image sensors prepared in the first through sixth embodiments, as compared with those of Comparative Example 1, which adopts the conventional four-transistor configuration, and Comparative Example 2, which adopts the conventional five-transistor configuration and is described in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2005/083790, Japanese Kokai Patent Application No. 2005-328493, and Japanese Kokai Patent Application No. 2006-217410.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The dynamic range of the CMOS sensor in the first embodiment is much wider than that in Comparative Example 1, and a dynamic range can be guaranteed similar to that of Comparative Example 2. Also, no measure is necessary in handling the dark current of the floating diffusion and additive capacitive element, so it is possible to reduce the burden on development of the process. Also, it is possible to obtain a low-sensitivity output image (second signal) independent of kTC noise. Also, it is possible to reduce the noise level difference when a low sensitivity output and high sensitivity output are synthesized to form an image, and it is possible to obtain natural images without using a noise filter.</p>

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As explained above, for the CMOS image sensor of the present embodiments, the following effects can be realized:</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">1. Even with low-sensitivity output, it is still possible to cancel the dark current and kTC noise of the floating diffusion and additive capacitive element by handling only the charge stored in the photodiodes, so it is possible to obtain a low-noise image.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">2. While a wide dynamic range similar to that of the 5-transistor type conventional scheme described in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2005/083790, Japanese Kokai Patent Application No. 2005-328493, and Japanese Kokai Patent Application No. 2006-217410 is realized, the use of an additive capacitive element set facing each electrode via an insulating film is not necessary. Consequently, because sharing by pixels is possible, it is possible to realize finer pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">3. It is possible to reduce the electron-number equivalent noise quality for each pixel by means of gain-up for the pixels. Also, gain-up in the latter stage is not necessary, so noise is not amplified by the latter stage. As a result, it is possible to significantly lower the noise at the chip output.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The invention is not limited to the foregoing examples. For example, one may also adopt a scheme in which the capacitance ratio between the floating diffusion and the additive capacitive element is adjusted appropriately corresponding to the design, etc. Also, as the additive capacitive element, it is possible to adopt an element prepared by setting two electrodes facing each other via an insulating film. Moreover, those skilled in the art to which the invention relates will appreciate that other modifications may be made within departing from the scope of the claimed invention.</p>
