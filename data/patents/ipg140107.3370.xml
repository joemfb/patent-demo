<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Apparatus and associated method and computer program products involve a highly efficient uninterruptible power distribution architecture to support modular processing units. As an illustrative example, a modular processing unit includes an corresponding uninterruptible power system in which only one AC-to-DC rectification occurs between the utility AC grid and the processing circuit (e.g., microprocessor) loads. In an illustrative data center facility, a power distribution architecture includes a modular array of rack-mountable processing units, each of which has processing circuitry to handle network-related processing tasks. Associated with each modular processing unit is an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to supply operating power to the network processing circuitry. Each UPS includes a battery selectively connectable across a DC bus, and a AC-to-DC rectifier that converts an AC input voltage to a single output voltage on the DC bus. The regulated DC bus voltage may be close to the battery's fully charged voltage.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The following disclosure relates to a power distribution architecture for data centers, for example, techniques and associated apparatus to efficiently deliver uninterruptible power to scalable and/or modular data processing equipment.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Computers have become widely adopted for various applications, for both personal and corporate uses. Some computers operate as stand-alone data processing equipment, with perhaps a peripheral such as a printer and a display device. Although useful for many purposes, additional features and benefits may be achieved if multiple computers are networked together to share information and resources.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A computer network may be formed by connecting two or more computing devices with an information channel. One type of network is a local area network (LAN). A typical residential LAN, for example, may connect two computers to a printer. A typical corporate LAN, for example, may allow many users to share resources and large amounts of information, including databases and application software.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A second type of network is a wide area network (WAN). A prime example of a WAN is the Internet. WANs such as the Internet allow many computer devices to communicate messages and share information. When multiple LANs are interoperable with one or more WANs, opportunities for computing devices to communicate and share information greatly expand.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">From the perspective of an individual computing device that is connected to a network, users may direct the communication of information over a network with a user interface generated by a web browser application. A web browser is typically configured to enable the user to access web sites on the Internet or the World Wide Web. Web browsers allow users to easily send and receive messages over a network in packets of information. Such packets of information may include the address of a search engine website, such as www.dogpile.com, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The popularity and simplicity of sharing information over networks, such as the Internet, has resulted in demand for data processing and storage capacity to support high network traffic volume. One mechanism to address this need may be referred to as a data center. In the context of the Internet, a data center may provide processing, storage, and support functions that improve performance or enhance the utility of the Internet. Data centers may also be deployed in other contexts. Financial institutions, for example, may employ one or more data centers to store financial account and transaction information.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A data center may provide data processing and storage capacity. In operation, a data center may be connected to a network, and may receive and respond to various requests from the network to retrieve, process, and/or store data. In addition to extensive data processing and data storage capabilities, data centers typically support high speed data transfer and routing capabilities. To meet future network demands, data center capacity may continue to expand.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an exemplary power distribution architecture <b>100</b> for a data center <b>105</b> in which each of a number of modular rack-mounted bases (which may also be referred to as trays) <b>110</b> includes an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) <b>115</b> and a computer motherboard <b>120</b>. Efficient power delivery may be achieved by configuring the UPS <b>115</b> to perform the only AC-to-DC rectification that occurs between the AC mains power received from the electric utility grid and the DC power consumed by the motherboard <b>120</b>. In this example, AC mains refers to the AC power source available at the point of use in the data center <b>105</b>. When received in the data center <b>105</b> at the UPS <b>115</b>, the AC mains voltage is a substantially sinusoidal AC signal (e.g., 50 Hz, 60 Hz) that was generated, transmitted, and distributed by the electric utility. The AC mains input voltage is converted to a single DC voltage on a DC bus that delivers operating power to the motherboard <b>120</b>. In the event of a fault on the AC mains, a battery circuit is electrically connected across the DC bus to supply operating power to the motherboard <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the depicted example, the data center <b>105</b> includes a number of racks <b>125</b>A, <b>125</b>B, <b>125</b>C that contain a number of the trays <b>110</b>. The racks <b>125</b>A-<b>125</b>C may be powered by three phase AC power line voltages that are delivered to the data center <b>105</b> from an electric utility <b>130</b>. The AC power line voltages delivered to each of the racks <b>125</b>A-<b>125</b>C may originate from an AC generator (e.g., operated by the electric utility). The AC voltage signals, which are substantially sinusoidal, may be transmitted to a distribution point, such as a substation (not shown) in the utility grid, for example. The power line voltages (e.g., 480 V line-to-line) may be distributed from the substation to the data center <b>105</b>. In the data center <b>105</b>, individual phase voltages (e.g., 208 V line-to-neutral) are routed to the individual racks <b>125</b>A-<b>125</b>C. Suitable AC-to-AC transformers (not shown) may be employed, as necessary, to deliver the AC power at a specified AC voltage. For example, step-down transformers may transform AC power from high voltage levels suitable for transmission to levels that can be substantially directly applied to the UPS <b>115</b>. In some three phase configurations, for example, such transformers may make appropriate transformations between WYE and DELTA connections if required.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Unless otherwise indicated, references to AC voltages are understood to refer to substantially sinusoidal voltages, and voltage amplitudes are understood to refer to root mean square (r.m.s.) values. The utility <b>130</b> may deliver substantially symmetric three phase voltages suitable for powering substantially balanced three phase loads.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the depicted example, one phase voltage and a neutral line are distributed to each rack <b>125</b>. The racks <b>125</b> and trays <b>110</b> may be configured in to form a substantially balanced load. In other embodiments, a similar distribution may be used if the data center <b>105</b> included additional (or fewer) racks <b>125</b>. As an example, the exemplary tray <b>110</b> (shown in magnified detail) in the rack <b>125</b>A receives a phase A voltage and the neutral line. Each of the trays <b>110</b> in the rack <b>125</b>A receives the same AC input voltage signal, namely the Phase A-to-neutral voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Similarly, each of the trays <b>110</b> in the rack <b>125</b>B receives a Phase B-to-neutral as the AC input voltage signal, and each of the trays <b>110</b> in the rack <b>125</b>C receives Phase C-to-neutral as the AC input voltage signal. In other implementations, different phase voltages may be distributed among the trays <b>110</b> in one of the racks <b>125</b>A-<b>125</b>C, and/or the AC input voltage signal to each of the trays <b>110</b> may be line-to-line voltages instead of line-to-neutral voltages. In various embodiments, any practical number of phases (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . 12 or more) may be distributed to provide operating power to individual trays <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Each of the trays <b>110</b> in the depicted example is coupled to a network connection <b>140</b>. The network connection <b>140</b> provides an information channel to a network <b>145</b>, which may include, for example, a local area network, virtual private network, wide area network (e.g., the Internet), or a combination of such networks, which may be wired, fiber optic, and/or wireless. A remote computer <b>150</b> represents one of many possible devices that could communicate data directly or indirectly with one or more trays to access, store, process, and/or retrieve information using a processor <b>160</b> and associated memory <b>165</b> on the motherboard <b>120</b>. In some implementations, additional processors (e.g., servers) may facilitate such communication. For example, the exemplary remote computer device <b>150</b> may be included in a server, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, and/or a handheld processor-based device. One or more servers may pre- or post-process, supervise, route, and/or balance the flow of data associated with the communication.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In various embodiments, the motherboard <b>120</b> may include two, three, four, or any other practicable number of processors <b>160</b>. In some embodiments, the motherboard <b>120</b> may be replaced with tray of data storage devices (e.g., hard disc drives, flash memory, RAM, or any of these or other types of memory in combination). In such embodiments, the data storage devices and the UPS <b>115</b> with the battery <b>185</b> may be supported on the tray <b>110</b>. In various embodiments, a digital processor may include any combination of analog and/or digital logic circuits, which may be integrated or discrete, and may further include programmable and/or programmed devices that may execute instructions stored in a memory. The memory <b>165</b> may include volatile and/or non-volatile memory that may be read and/or written to by the processor <b>160</b>. The motherboard <b>120</b> may further include some or all of a central processor unit(s) (CPU), memory (e.g., cache, non-volatile, flash), and/or disk drives, for example, along with various memories, chip sets, and associated support circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the motherboard <b>120</b> may provide one or more DC-to-DC converters to convert the DC bus voltage to a suitable voltage for operating the circuitry in the motherboard <b>120</b>. For example, one or more DC-to-DC converters may provide regulated output voltages, which may include, for example. a +3.3VDC power signal, a +5VDC power signal, a &#x2212;5VDC power signal, a +12VDC power signal, and a &#x2212;12VDC power signal.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an exemplary implementation, the processor <b>160</b> and the memory <b>165</b> on the motherboard <b>120</b> may form at least a part of a processing system configured to handle network operations. As an illustrative example, the motherboard <b>120</b> may help to process Internet requests. The motherboard may process information either alone or in combination with other parallel processes running on other processor-based devices, such as one or more other trays <b>110</b> in the data center <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">An AC input voltage signal is delivered to each of the trays <b>110</b> to be processed by the UPS <b>115</b>. In some examples, the AC input voltage signal may be received from the AC mains. The UPS <b>115</b> includes an AC-to-DC converter <b>170</b> that converts the AC input voltage signal to a regulated DC voltage. The converter <b>170</b> outputs the regulated DC voltage onto a DC bus <b>175</b>. In some embodiments, the AC-to-DC converter <b>170</b> may regulate the DC voltage to a static set point. In some other embodiments, the set point may be dynamically determined. In some of the static and dynamic embodiments, the set point may be based on a characteristic of the battery. Examples of such set point regulation will be described in additional detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The AC-to-DC converter <b>170</b> may maintain voltage regulation on the DC bus <b>175</b> when the AC input voltage signal is in a normal range. A normal range for a typical sinusoidal AC signal may be specified in various ways. For example, one or more thresholds may be specified between about 80 V and 500 V for line frequencies that may be between about 40 Hz and 1000 Hz, such as around 50 Hz, 60 Hz, 100 Hz, 200 Hz, 300 Hz, 400 Hz, 500 Hz, . . . , and up to about 1000 Hz or more. As an illustrative example, for a 120 V nominal AC input voltage signal, a fault may be identified if the AC peak input voltage falls below a first threshold of 90 V in any half cycle, or if the r.m.s. voltage drops below a second threshold of 100 V for a predetermined amount of time. Fault conditions may include, without limitation, blackouts, brownouts, voltage sags, surges, instabilities related to switchgear operation, or other electrical transient associated with the AC mains. In some implementations, a fault condition may cause or potentially cause improper operation of a processing unit in the DC load, for example, if the AC-to-DC converter <b>170</b> is unable to maintain adequate regulation of the voltage on the DC bus <b>175</b>, and/or to supply sufficient current to operate the DC loads serviced by the DC bus <b>175</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">If the AC input voltage signal falls outside of a normal range, such as during a fault condition, a detection circuit (not shown) may send a signal indicative of this condition. In response to detecting the fault condition, a battery circuit <b>180</b> may be configured to connect a battery <b>185</b> across the DC bus <b>175</b> so that the motherboard <b>120</b> can continue to operate substantially without interruption. The battery <b>185</b> may continue to provide operating power to the circuits on the motherboard <b>115</b> until the battery <b>185</b> substantially discharges. The battery circuit <b>180</b> may include circuitry capable of controlling the charging and/or discharging the battery across the DC bus <b>175</b> in various operating modes. An exemplary battery circuit is described in further detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</figref>, <b>5</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> are block diagrams that illustrate exemplary power distribution architectures for delivering power to operate DC loads that have at least one processor. For example, the motherboard <b>120</b> may constitute a DC load in various embodiments. In these examples, the AC-to-DC converter <b>170</b> provides the only AC-to-DC rectification that occurs between the AC utility grid (e.g., substation transformer, transmission line, generator, and the like) and the microprocessor <b>160</b> in any of the trays <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an exemplary power distribution architecture in a system <b>300</b>, which may be implemented in a large facility with large power requirements, for example. The system <b>200</b> includes a utility AC mains generator <b>205</b> to supply AC mains voltage from a utility such as the electric utility <b>130</b>. The exemplary system <b>200</b> also includes two back-up AC generators, including a diesel fuel powered generator <b>210</b> and a co-located (e.g., turbine) generator <b>215</b>. Power from the generators <b>205</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>215</b> may be combined and/or selected by the AC switchgear <b>220</b>, and then delivered to the tray <b>110</b> via an AC bus <b>225</b>. In the event of a fault on the AC mains from the generator <b>205</b>, the generators <b>210</b>, <b>215</b> may provide a backup AC input voltage signal on the AC bus <b>225</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some implementations, a substantially asynchronous energy source may be used to generate a substantially sinusoidal AC voltage signal. For example, a flywheel energy storage and recovery system may be used. Wind or solar generated energy, such as that provided by a wind farm or a solar farm, respectively, may serve as sources of energy to generate a substantially sinusoidal AC voltage in an electric utility grid. In such implementations, the generated substantially sinusoidal signal is transmitted through the utility grid to an input of the AC-to-DC converter <b>170</b> without intervening AC-to-DC rectification.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In cooperation with the battery backup provided by the battery <b>185</b>, the generators <b>205</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>215</b> may provide substantially uninterruptible power to operate a DC load <b>230</b> on the tray <b>110</b> for short, intermediate, and/or longer term periods.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">An exemplary use of the generators <b>210</b>, <b>215</b>, may be illustrated in the event of a fault (e.g., brownout, blackout) or unavailability (e.g., circuit maintenance) of the AC mains voltage from the generator <b>205</b>. In response to detecting the fault on the AC input voltage signal, the battery <b>185</b> is connected to deliver substantially battery voltage across the DC bus <b>175</b>. As such, short term (e.g., at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 seconds at full load) operation of the DC load is maintained by power supplied from the battery <b>185</b>. The diesel generator <b>210</b> may be started to provide power to the AC bus <b>225</b>, preferably before the battery <b>185</b> fully discharges. For more extended AC power faults, the co-located generator <b>215</b> may be brought on-line to provide a more cost-effective operation, or to avoid exceeding government-regulated limits on diesel fuel generation.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some implementations, one or both of the generators <b>210</b>, <b>215</b> may provide peak load shedding capability. For example, the co-located generator <b>215</b> may be used during expected peak demand hours each day. In some cases, this may permit negotiation of preferential rates for electric power from the electric utility <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an exemplary schematic in additional detail. In various embodiments, the AC-to-DC converter <b>170</b> may regulate the single output voltage on the DC bus to a set point. The set point may be a static value in some embodiments, or it may be dynamically determined during operation. For example, the set point may be based, at least in part, on one or more electrical characteristics of the battery.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Characteristics on which a set point can be established may include battery characteristics such as battery chemistry, battery age, charge/discharge history, nominal maximum charge, temperature, charging profile (e.g., voltage charge rate under constant current), estimates of battery internal impedance, or other parameters relating to the electrical performance of the battery.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition to internal battery characteristics, the set point may be based at least in part on electrical circuit parameters of the battery circuit <b>180</b> and the DC bus <b>175</b>. In some embodiments, the set point to which the AC-to-DC converter <b>170</b> regulates the voltage on the DC bus <b>175</b> can be a function of a battery charging circuit topology. If the battery charging circuit provides a voltage boost circuit (e.g., boost converter, charge pump, flyback), then the set point voltage may be substantially at or below a desired maximum charge voltage. If the battery charging circuit only provides a voltage step-down (e.g., linear regulator, buck converter) capability, then the set point can be set to a value sufficiently above the maximum nominal charge voltage to achieve the required charge performance over relevant temperatures, taking account of tradeoffs in power loss and charging current and corresponding charge time. In light of such trade-offs, the set point may be only as high as necessary to meet charge time specifications. For example, the set point may be set to between about 0.050 and about 1 Volt above the nominal expected battery voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In various embodiments, the set point voltage may be set based on a specified temperature, such as 0, 10, 25, 30, 40, 50, . . . , 80 degrees Celsius. In an illustrative example, the set point may be dynamically adjusted based on a temperature in or around the battery <b>185</b> as measured by at least one temperature sensor (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the depicted embodiment, the UPS <b>115</b> includes a charge/discharge control circuit <b>305</b> in series connection with the battery <b>185</b>, and further includes the controller <b>245</b> in operative connection with a non-volatile memory (NVM) <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The series connected battery <b>185</b> and circuit <b>305</b> are connected across the DC bus <b>175</b>. Responsive to a signal indicative of a fault on the AC input voltage signal, the circuit <b>305</b> can operatively connect the battery <b>185</b> across the DC bus <b>175</b> to permit the battery to discharge to the DC load <b>230</b> through a low impedance path. When the AC input voltage signal on the AC bus <b>225</b> is not faulted, the circuit <b>305</b> may selectively permit charging current to flow from the DC bus <b>175</b> to charge the battery <b>185</b>. If multiple batteries or battery strings are connected in electrical parallel, individual strings or groups of strings may be independently charged at different rates according to a defined charging algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the depicted embodiment, the NVM <b>310</b> may store set point information for regulating the output of the AC-to-DC converter <b>170</b>.

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The schematic <b>500</b> further includes an over-current protection element <b>515</b>, which in this example includes a fuse.

In other examples, additional series and/or shunt devices to provide over-current, over-voltage, reverse protection, EMI mitigation, and/or other functions.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the depicted embodiment, a pair of terminals (+Battery, &#x2212;Battery) is connectable to a battery. The negative battery terminal (&#x2212;Battery), connects to two parallel paths, each of which is controllable by operation of a switch. One of the parallel paths connects the negative battery terminal to a negative rail of the DC bus <b>175</b> through a resistor <b>520</b> and a switch <b>525</b>. This path permits a charging current to flow when the switch is closed. The amplitude of the charging current is substantially limited by the value of the resistance <b>520</b> and the difference between the voltage on the DC bus <b>175</b> and the battery (not shown). The internal resistance of the battery is typically much less than the value of the resistance <b>520</b>. In some applications, the voltage drop across the resistance <b>520</b> may be used to measure and/or control the charging current.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The other parallel path connects the negative battery terminal to a negative rail of the DC bus <b>175</b> through a switch <b>530</b>. When the switch <b>530</b> is closed, the battery is operatively connected across the DC bus <b>175</b>. In this state, the battery can discharge and supply operating power to any DC loads (not shown) that are also connected across the DC bus <b>175</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The switches <b>525</b>, <b>530</b> may be passive and/or actively controlled. An exemplary embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, is illustrative of one implementation, and is not to be taken as limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the battery <b>185</b> is modeled with a series resistance <b>540</b> that may represent internal and/or contact resistance, for example. The ideal switch <b>525</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) for charging the battery is implemented as a diode with no active control input. In this implementation, the AC-to-DC converter <b>170</b> (not shown) may regulate the DC bus <b>175</b> to a voltage that is sufficient to forward bias the diode (switch) <b>525</b> over temperatures of interest and to provide a desired charging current. As such, the set point may be at least the maximum charging voltage plus a diode drop voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the depicted example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the battery charging current is determined, at least in part, by a series resistance and a unidirectional current mechanism, such as a diode or other semiconductor switch, for example. In other embodiments, the battery charger may include a series-pass regulator (e.g., low drop out (LDO) linear regulator) or a switch mode power converter (e.g., buck, boost, buck-boost, Cepic, Cuk, flyback, charge pump, or resonant, etc.), either alone or in combination. The battery charge current may be controlled by current mirror techniques, or using current measurement feedback techniques involving current sense resistance or inductive coupling measurement, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The ideal switch <b>530</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) for discharging the battery is implemented as a back-to-back MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor) switch configured to block current in both directions when in a non-conductive state. This switch <b>530</b> opens and closes in response to a control signal <b>535</b> that may be generated, for example, by the controller <b>245</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), for example. In various embodiments, the switches <b>525</b>, <b>530</b> may include Schottky diodes, insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), or other semiconductor or electro-mechanical switches (e g., relays).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-7</figref> are flow diagrams illustrating exemplary methods that may be performed in embodiments of the power distribution architecture.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a flowchart <b>600</b> illustrates an exemplary method that the UPS <b>115</b> may perform to handle a fault condition on the AC input voltage signal. In some embodiments, the UPS <b>115</b> may perform the method to coordinate switchover to and/or from the battery as a temporary power source. In some cases, performing the method may substantially reduce and/or prevent performance disruptions (e.g., data errors) as a consequence of the AC fault condition. For example, the battery <b>185</b> may provide sufficient operating power to maintain operation of the DC loads <b>230</b> until an AC source, such as the utility mains <b>205</b> or backup generators <b>210</b>, <b>215</b>, can be brought on-line. In some embodiments, the battery <b>185</b> may continue to provide operating power while the DC loads <b>230</b> execute instructions to perform graceful power-down operations. Such graceful shutdown operations can vary widely, but generally attempt to mitigate performance disruptions that could result from the fault condition. Such disruptions may, for example, manifest themselves as stale data when the processing system is subsequently restarted.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Generally, the method includes operations that may be performed by a controller (e.g., the controller <b>245</b>). The operations may further be performed under the control, supervision, and/or monitoring of one or more of the processors <b>160</b> in the system <b>100</b>. Operations may also be supplemented or augmented by other processing and/or control elements that may be in operative communication with the controller through a network connection <b>140</b> coupled to the tray <b>110</b>. Some or all of the operations may be performed by one or more processors executing instructions tangibly embodied in a signal. The processing may be implemented using analog and/or digital hardware or techniques, either alone or in cooperation with one or more processors executing instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The method begins at step <b>605</b> when the controller determines that there is a fault on the AC input voltage signal. For example, the controller may identify the occurrence of AC power failures by monitoring, for example, the AC bus <b>225</b>, a voltage status condition signal provided by a voltage monitoring/fault detection circuit on the tray <b>110</b>, and/or an output voltage (e.g., V<sub>UPS </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) at the DC bus <b>175</b>. In some embodiments, the UPS <b>115</b> may include an analog to digital converter that converts V<sub>UPS </sub>into a digital value (e.g., a 10 bit digital value). When the controller detects that a key voltage drops below a threshold, the controller may initiate an AC power fault routine. In other embodiments, the controller may receive signals from an external component, such as a power combiner in the AC switchgear <b>220</b>. Such signals may indicate a failure in the AC input voltage signal. In other embodiments, the AC-to-DC converter <b>170</b> may send a message to the controller to indicate an AC power fault.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">If the controller determines that the AC power is not faulted, then step <b>605</b> is repeated. If the controller determines that the AC power is in a fault condition, then, in step <b>610</b>, the controller switches the UPS <b>115</b> from AC operation to battery operation. For example, the controller may send signals to open the switch <b>525</b> and to close the switch <b>530</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) to operatively connect the battery <b>185</b> across the DC bus <b>175</b> such that the battery <b>185</b> can support the DC loads <b>230</b>. Next, in step <b>615</b>, the controller sets a timer to a backup duration time. The timer may be a register in the controller to decrement or increment as time advances. In some embodiments, the backup duration time may represent a duration that the battery power may be used or relied upon. For example, the controller may compute the backup duration time using an estimate of an expected battery life, less the time required for the DC loads <b>230</b> to perform graceful power down operations. In other embodiments, the controller may load the backup duration time from the NVM <b>310</b>. In step <b>620</b>, the controller determines whether the AC power is restored. For example, the controller may receive a message from the AC-to-DC converter about the present status of the AC input power. As another example, the controller may poll the AC-to-DC converter to determine whether the AC power is restored. If the controller determines that the AC power is restored, then the controller may perform operations in step <b>625</b> to switch back to operating from AC power, and the method <b>600</b> then ends. An exemplary method for switching from battery power to AC power is described in further detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">If, at step <b>620</b>, the controller determines that the AC power is not restored, then in step <b>630</b> the controller checks whether V<sub>UPS </sub>is less than a minimum voltage for battery backup (V<sub>OFF</sub>). If the controller determines that V<sub>UPS </sub>is less than V<sub>OFF</sub>, then the controller may set the timer to a power down time in step <b>630</b>. For example, the power down time may be an estimation of the time required for the DC loads to perform the power down operations. In some examples, the power down operations of the DC loads may prevent data loss and/or avoid damage due to sudden loss of DC power. If, in step <b>630</b>, the controller determines that V<sub>UPS </sub>is not less than V<sub>OFF</sub>, then, in step <b>640</b>, the controller may determine whether an output voltage of the battery (V<sub>BATT</sub>) is less than a battery low threshold (BATT_LOW). In some embodiments, when V<sub>BATT </sub>is lower than BATT_LOW, it may indicate that the power stored in the battery is low and proper power down operations may be executed to prevent data loss, for example. If the controller determines that V<sub>BATT </sub>is less than BATT_LOW, then the step <b>635</b> is performed. If the controller determines that VBATT is not less than BATT_LOW, then the controller may check whether the backup duration time is expired. If the controller determines that the backup duration time is expired, then the step <b>635</b> is performed. If the controller determines that the backup duration time is not expired, then the step <b>620</b> is repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">After the controller sets the timer to the power down time in step <b>635</b>, the controller may check whether the AC power is restored in step <b>650</b>. If the controller determines that the AC power is restored, then the step <b>625</b> is performed. If the controller determines that the AC power is not restored, then the controller determines whether the power down time is expired in step <b>655</b>. If the controller determines that the power down time is not expired, then the step <b>650</b> is repeated. If the controller determines that the power down time is expired, then the controller may, in step <b>660</b>, power down the UPS (e.g., open the switch <b>530</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and the method ends.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a flow chart that illustrates an exemplary method <b>700</b> of operations for switching from battery backup power to AC input power. For example, a controller may switch from battery operation to AC operation after AC power is restored after an AC power failure (e.g., see step <b>625</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), or after a maintenance operation (e.g., a battery test operation).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some embodiments, the controller may delay the transfer from battery power operation to AC power operation to mitigate, for example, high peak (e.g., inrush) currents into the data center <b>105</b>. A small fixed delay may further be provided to ensure that the AC input voltage is stable.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As described with reference to step <b>625</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), the method <b>700</b> may begin when the controller determines that the AC input power is restored. First, in step <b>710</b>, the controller may determine a random delay parameter. For example, a random delay parameter may be stored in the NVM <b>310</b> that represents a length of time (e.g., time, clock cycles) to delay (e.g., 1 ms, 0.5 ms, 0.025 ms, etc.) before switching to AC powered operation.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some embodiments, the random delay parameter may be randomly or pseudo-randomly determined. For example, the controller may generate a pseudo-random delay parameter using a seed (e.g., a serial number stored in a memory register on the UPS <b>115</b> and/or the motherboard <b>120</b>, a machine time when the tray is first started-up, etc.). The delay parameter may then be used by the controller <b>245</b> and/or stored in the NVM <b>310</b>. In another example, the delay parameter may be a random number (e.g., recorded from a physical process such as radioactive decay) that is stored in the NVM <b>310</b> during manufacturing process of the UPS <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In one embodiment, the controller sets a timer to the random delay at step <b>715</b>. In other embodiments, the controller may monitor the delay using a counter, a real time clock, an analog ramp or decay circuit with a threshold comparator, or other suitable delay device. Then, the controller determines, in step <b>720</b>, whether V<sub>BATT </sub>is less than BATT_LOW. If V<sub>BATT </sub>is less than BATT_LOW, indicating that the battery is running out of charge, then the controller may switch from battery power to AC power in step <b>725</b> and the method <b>700</b> ends. For example, the controller may switch off battery power by opening the switch <b>530</b> in the circuit <b>500</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). In the exemplary data center <b>105</b>, it is unlikely that all the batteries will reach a discharge limit at the same time, so this method is not expected to substantially increase peak currents on the AC input voltage lines in most embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">If V<sub>BATT </sub>is not less than BATT_LOW in step <b>725</b>, then, in step <b>730</b>, the controller checks whether the timer has expired. If the specified delay is not reached, then the step <b>725</b> is repeated. If the specified delay is reached, then the step <b>720</b> is repeated and the method <b>700</b> ends.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In various embodiments, the battery voltage may be above and/or below the regulated voltage on the DC bus. In some embodiments, the AC-to-DC converter may regulate to a set point voltage that is within 50, 100, 200, 250, 400, 500, . . . , 1000 mV of the battery's nominal fully charged voltage. In various implementations, the regulation set point may be dynamically determined, for example, based on battery characteristics, such as the age, usage history, temperature, internal resistance, charge time response, discharge time response, or other battery circuit-related characteristics. If the battery voltage is above the set-point voltage, then the charger may include a step-up and/or buck-boost type converter circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In some embodiments, a tray <b>110</b> may be a modular support structure configured to be mounted in one of a number of locations, slots, or positions in the rack <b>125</b>. Each tray <b>120</b> may include a substrate, such as a printed circuit board (PCB), on which the UPS <b>175</b> and the motherboard <b>120</b> and/or other DC loads <b>230</b> may be integrated. The trays <b>110</b> may provide features for a thermal management system, including ports for air flow, when installed in one of the racks <b>125</b>. The term &#x201c;tray&#x201d; is not intended to refer to a particular arrangement, but instead refers to any arrangement of computer-related components coupled together to serve a particular purpose, such as on a motherboard. Trays may be generally mounted parallel to other trays in a horizontal or vertical stack, so as to permit denser packing than would otherwise be possible with computers having free-standing housings and other components. The term &#x201c;blade&#x201d; may also be employed to refer to such apparatuses. Trays may be implemented in particular configurations, including as computer servers, switches (e.g., electrical and optical), routers, drives or groups of drives, and other computing-related devices.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Embodiments of the UPS <b>115</b> may be configured to accept various primary or secondary battery technologies. Technologies may include, but are not limited to sealed lead acid, nickel metal hydride, nickel cadmium, wire wound lead acid, alkaline, and lithium ion. The UPS <b>115</b> may include circuitry to auto-detect battery chemistry, and adapt charging and discharge profile information according to the determined battery characteristics. In some embodiments, the set point to which the AC-to-DC converter <b>170</b> regulates the DC bus <b>175</b> may be responsive to the auto-detected battery characteristics. In various embodiments, the battery voltage may be between about 8 Volts and about 26 Volts, such as about 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, . . . , 23, 24, or 25 Volts.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">For example, a nominal 12 Volt lead acid battery may have a corresponding set point regulation on the DC bus of about 13.65 Volts, for example, to provide for substantially fully charging the battery. In the event of a switchover from 13.65 Volts regulation on the DC bus to battery voltage, the transient step (in this case, a drop) in voltage on the input to the DC load will be relatively small, such as less than 1 Volt, for example. Such a small change in the input voltage may substantially mitigate adverse transients in the DC loads.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The battery <b>185</b> may be a single cell, or a combination of cells arranged in series and/or parallel. In some embodiments, one or more batteries in a UPS may be hot swappable in modes other than battery back-up mode in which the battery is discharging into the load during a fault condition on the AC bus <b>225</b>. A visual or audible indicator may be provided to alert service personnel whether the battery may be hot swapped.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">When mounted on a tray <b>110</b>, a battery may be located and supported for quick and convenient replacement. Various quick connect/quick disconnect wire harnesses (e.g., Fast-on style connectors), spring-biased electrical contacts, snap features, locking tabs, or the like may be employed to retain batteries for secure connection and quick replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">AC mains voltage, as used herein, may refer to AC voltage sources that typically have a fundamental frequency between about 47 Hz and about 500 Hz, without being necessarily so limited. Sources of AC voltage may be derived from stationary or mobile sources, examples of which may include AC generators on transport vehicles, trucks, trains, ships, aircraft, or the like. AC generators include, for example, sources of electric power that substantially derive from coupling a time-varying magnetic field to one or more conductors to produce a substantially sinusoidal voltage. In some implementations, a magnetic field is rotated relative to one or more conductive windings. In some other implementations, one or more conductive windings are rotated relative to a stationary magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The AC-to-DC converter <b>170</b>, being the only AC-to-DC rectification in the power path from the AC generator to the DC load <b>230</b>, may include features to reduce harmonic distortion, mitigate conducted emissions, manage inrush current, and the like. Accordingly, the converter <b>170</b> may incorporate hardware, software, or a combination thereof, to provide power factor correction, spread spectrum (e.g., frequency hopping) switching frequency, filtering, and/or current controlled start-up, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Regulation of the DC bus voltage output by the converter <b>170</b> may be accomplished by employing any suitable switching converter and control strategy for providing the single output voltage at a determined set point. Switching topologies may include, but are not limited to, forward, flyback, Cuk, SEPIC, buck, buck-boost, or any suitable resonant or quasi-resonant AC-to-DC converter. In one illustrative embodiment, the AC-to-DC rectification and conversion is accomplished, at least in part, with appropriate operation of an active switching matrix having four controllable switches that modulate the AC input voltage applied to an inductive element in a buck arrangement. In another illustrative embodiment, the AC input voltage is rectified by an uncontrolled diode rectifier stage, followed by a magnetically coupled DC-to-DC conversion stage using a forward or flyback topology, for example. In yet another illustrative example, a power factor input stage is followed by one or more cascaded step-down DC-to-DC converter stages to yield the regulated voltage at the determined set point. Linear regulation may be used in combination with switch-mode power conversion. From this disclosure, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize a number of implementations for the AC-to-DC converter <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">With reference for example to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> as an illustrative example, some embodiments of the system <b>400</b> may operate in any of at least four modes. In a first mode, the processing unit <b>405</b> is shut down, as is the UPS <b>115</b>. In a second mode, the battery <b>185</b> is charged using power received from the DC bus <b>175</b>. In this second mode, the battery <b>185</b> may fast charge or trickle charge according to a charging algorithm. In a third mode, the battery is &#x201c;floated&#x201d; being effectively disconnected from the DC bus and neither charging nor discharging while the AC-to-DC converter supplies operating power to the DC load <b>230</b>. In a fourth mode, the battery is operatively connected to the DC bus <b>175</b>, and discharges to supply operating power to the DC loads <b>230</b>. This fourth condition may be initiated in response to a fault condition on the AC bus <b>225</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In various implementations, transfers between voltage sources may involve certain transition sequences. The AC switchgear <b>220</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), for example, may transfer between any of the generators <b>205</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>215</b> using either a substantially make-before-break or a substantially break-before-make transfer sequence. When switching from AC input operation to battery operation, the UPS <b>115</b> may, in some embodiments, disable operation of the AC-to-DC converter before, substantially during, or after the battery <b>185</b> is connected across the DC bus <b>175</b>. If all the converter <b>175</b> output current passes through a series diode, for example, then the converter <b>175</b> may be disabled by simply disabling operation of the DC-to-DC switching at the switch-mode controller (not shown). In other embodiments, the output may be actively disconnected by a semiconductor switch, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">A number of embodiments have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosed embodiments. For example, advantageous results may be achieved if the steps of the disclosed techniques were performed in a different sequence, if components in the disclosed systems were combined in a different manner, or if the components were replaced or supplemented by other components. Accordingly, other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims.</p>
