<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an organic EL display device which uses organic EL elements as pixels, and more particularly to an improved power source wiring which supplies electricity for allowing the organic EL elements to emit light.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An organic EL element is a current-light-emitting-type element which emits light when an electric current flows therethrough, wherein a large current of several tens to 100 mA flows in a power source line in the inside of a TFT substrate on which the organic EL elements are formed. Particularly, in performing fixed-voltage driving of an EL display panel, when electricity is supplied to respective pixels via the power source line in the inside of the TFT substrate from a terminal at an inlet of the display panel, due to a voltage drop which is generated attributed to the resistance of the power source line, image defects such as the brightness inclination, smears and the like are generated. Accordingly, it is necessary to reduce the resistance of the power source line in the inside of the TFT substrate (from the inlet of the display panel to the respective pixels).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">With respect to the reduction of the power source resistance, in following patent document 1, there is described a technique in which, for lowering a voltage drop attributed to the resistance of a drive power source line which drives a plurality of organic EL elements arranged in a matrix array, auxiliary power source lines are connected to both ends (and an intermediate portion) of a drive power source line.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent document 1: JP-A-2003-108068</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the above-mentioned patent document 1, although the voltage drop of the drive power source line which is connected to a plurality of organic EL elements is lowered, a voltage drop of the auxiliary power source lines which are connected to the plurality of drive power source lines is not taken into consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an organic EL display device which reduces a voltage drop of a power source bus line which supplies electricity to a power source line which is connected to a plurality of organic EL elements.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention is directed to an organic EL display device which includes a power source line which is connected to a plurality of organic EL elements and a power source bus line which is connected to the power source line, wherein electricity is supplied to a plurality of portions including both ends of the power source bus line or both ends of the power source bus line.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the present invention, it is possible to obtain the organic EL display device which can reduce the voltage drop attributed to the line resistance of the power source bus line which supplies electricity to the power source line of the organic EL elements thus effectively overcoming image defects such as the brightness inclination, smears or the like attributed to the power source bus line.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The display device according to the present invention is applicable to a TV receiver set, a PC monitor, a notebook type PC, a PDA, a mobile phone, a digital still camera, a digital video camera, a car navigation monitor and the like. Further, the display device according to the present invention is also applicable to other self-luminous light-emitting-type display.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Hereinafter, the present invention is explained in conjunction with embodiments by reference to drawings.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Embodiment 1</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> are general appearance views of an organic EL display device according to the present invention, wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a front view and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a cross-sectional view. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a pixel part <b>12</b> is formed on a TFT substrate (display panel) <b>11</b>, and the pixel part <b>12</b> is sealed by the TFT substrate <b>11</b>, a sealing substrate <b>13</b> which faces the TFT substrate <b>11</b>, and a sealing material <b>14</b>. In a sealed space, for preventing the degradation of organic EL elements in the pixel part <b>12</b> attributed to moisture, a desiccant material <b>15</b> is sealed. Further, on the TFT substrate <b>11</b>, a FPC (Flexible Printed Circuit) <b>16</b> for supplying signal for driving the organic EL elements and for supplying electricity from a power source part is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a drive circuit diagram of the organic EL display device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, pixels <b>22</b> each of which is formed of the organic EL element are arranged in a matrix array in a display region <b>21</b>. The plurality of pixels <b>22</b> are connected to power source lines <b>23</b> and the plurality of power source lines <b>23</b> are connected to a power source bus line <b>24</b>. Both ends of the power source bus line <b>24</b> are connected to a power source part <b>25</b> via the FPC <b>16</b>. In this manner, the organic EL elements in the pixels <b>22</b> emit light with the electricity supplied to both ends of the power source bus line <b>24</b> from the power source part <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further, the plurality of pixels <b>22</b> which are arranged in a matrix array are connected to scanning lines <b>26</b> and data lines <b>27</b>, and are driven in response to scanning signals of the scanning lines <b>26</b> selected by a scanning line drive circuit <b>28</b> and data signals from the data lines <b>27</b> which are connected to a data line drive circuit <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A display control part <b>30</b> receives signals from the outside and supplies the scanning signals and the data signals to the scanning line drive circuit <b>28</b> and the data line drive circuit <b>29</b> via the FPC <b>16</b> and, at the same time, controls the power source part <b>25</b>. Although the power source part <b>25</b> and the display control part <b>30</b> are mounted on the FPC <b>16</b> in the drawing, it is not always necessary to mount the power source part <b>25</b> and the display control part <b>30</b> on the FPC <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Here, a cathode contact <b>31</b> is connected to cathodes of the organic EL elements in the pixels <b>22</b>, wherein the cathode contact <b>31</b> is grounded to the TFT substrate <b>11</b> and, at the same time, is grounded to the FPC <b>16</b> via the FPC <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a detailed view of the pixels <b>22</b> each of which is constituted of the organic EL element shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in each one of the plurality of pixels <b>22</b> arranged in the inside of the display region <b>21</b>, a switching TFT <b>41</b> which is selected by the scanning line drive circuit <b>28</b> and acquires the data signals from the data line drive circuit <b>29</b>, a capacitance <b>42</b> which stores the data signals, and a driver TFT <b>44</b> which drives the organic EL element <b>43</b> in response to the data signals are provided. The power source part <b>25</b> is connected to both ends of the power source bus line <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The organic EL element <b>43</b> has an anode side thereof connected to the driver TFT <b>44</b> and a cathode side thereof connected to a cathode current line <b>45</b> which holds a reference potential (ground potential), and the cathode current line <b>45</b> is connected to the cathode contact <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In this embodiment; electricity is supplied from both ends of the power source bus line <b>24</b> and hence, compared to the supply of electricity from one terminal, it is possible to lower a voltage drop attributed to the line resistance of the power source bus line <b>24</b>. By lowering the voltage drop in this manner, it is possible to reduce the brightness inclination in the horizontal direction of the horizontal power source bus line <b>24</b>. Here, the brightness inclination in the vertical direction attributed to the voltage drop of the vertical power source line <b>23</b> is ignored.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Embodiment 2</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a drive circuit diagram of an organic EL display device of an embodiment 2 corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> of the embodiment 1.
