<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a power converter configured to convert DC power generated by a power generator into AC power that is interconnectable with a commercial power system and to supply the power to an external load, and relates to a fuel cell system including the power converter.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Fuel cell systems are configured to supply power generated by a fuel cell to, for example, a household electrical load. The fuel cell in such a fuel cell system is interconnected with a commercial power system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In such a fuel cell system, control is performed such that surplus power generated by the fuel cell does not flow into power of the power system. Specifically, there are known fuel cell systems in which surplus power generated by a fuel cell is consumed by an internal load (an electric heater) (see Patent Literatures 1 to 3, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram schematically showing a schematic configuration of a fuel cell system disclosed in Patent Literature 1.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the fuel cell system disclosed in Patent Literature 1 includes: a fuel cell <b>106</b> which is operated in a manner interconnecting with a commercial power system <b>167</b>; an electric heater <b>153</b>; and a heater controller <b>154</b>. The fuel cell system is configured to supply surplus power generated by the fuel cell <b>106</b> to the electric heater <b>153</b>. The heater controller <b>154</b> adjusts the amount of power supplied to the electric heater <b>153</b> by means of a switching element.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0010">However, in the fuel cell system disclosed in Patent Literature 1, if for example the commercial power system <b>167</b> momentarily loses power or the commercial power system <b>167</b> is opened for a short period of time due to engineering work performed thereon, then DC power generated by the fuel cell <b>106</b> is temporality supplied to and consumed by the electric heater <b>153</b>. This causes an increased load on the switching element and the switching element generates heat, accordingly. Therefore, a large-sized radiation fin is required in order to dissipate the heat generated by the switching element. For this reason, the fuel cell system disclosed in Patent Literature 1 has problems of being large-sized, high-cost, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0011">The present invention has been made to solve the above conventional problems. An object of the present invention is to provide a power converter and a fuel cell system including the power converter, the power converter being capable of suppressing a load on a buck converter circuit when DC power generated by a power generator is temporarily supplied to an internal load such as an electric heater in a case where there is a fear that a reverse power flow into a power system may occur, that is, for example, a case where the power system momentarily loses power.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0012">In order to achieve the above object, a power converter according to the present invention is configured to convert DC power generated by a power generator into AC power, and the power converter includes: a boost converter circuit configured to boost an output voltage of the power generator; an inverter circuit configured to convert an output voltage of the boost converter circuit into AC power and to interconnect the AC power with a power system; a buck converter circuit configured to perform power conversion of output power of the boost converter circuit and to supply resultant power to an internal load; and a controller. The controller is configured to control the output voltage of the boost converter circuit to be higher than or equal to a first voltage value which is greater than the maximum value of AC voltage of the power system, in a case of interconnecting output power of the power generator with the power system via the boost converter circuit and the inverter circuit, and to control the output voltage of the boost converter circuit to be lower than or equal to a second voltage value which is less than the maximum value of AC voltage of the power system, in a case of supplying output power of the power generator to the internal load via the boost converter circuit and the buck converter circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0013">This configuration makes it possible to suppress a load on the buck converter circuit when the DC power generated by the power generator is temporarily supplied to the internal load such as an electric heater in a case where there is a fear that a reverse power flow into the power system may occur. Therefore, a large-sized radiation fin for dissipating heat from a power switching element of the buck converter circuit is not necessary. This allows the power converter to be reduced in size and cost.</p>

The output of the inverter circuit <b>5</b> is connected to the power system <b>2</b> via the filter <b>6</b> and the disconnection mechanism <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0031">The output of the boost converter circuit <b>3</b> is connected to a buck converter circuit <b>8</b>. The input of the buck converter circuit <b>8</b> is connected to the input of a power switching element Q<b>43</b>. The output of the buck converter circuit <b>8</b> is connected to the output of the power switching element Q<b>43</b>. The output of the buck converter circuit <b>8</b> is connected to an electric heater (internal load) <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0032">Examples of materials that can be used for forming the power switching elements used in the boost converter circuit <b>3</b>, inverter circuit <b>5</b>, and buck converter circuit <b>8</b> include SiC, GaN, and SiGe. Moreover, these power switching elements may be formed as MOSFETs, IGBTs, or other transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0033">The electric heater (internal load) <b>60</b> is an electrical load which temporarily consumes DC power generated by the DC power source which is the fuel cell body <b>1</b> when the power system <b>2</b> momentarily loses power or when the power system <b>2</b> is opened for a short period of time due to engineering work performed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0034">A controller <b>9</b> controls the buck converter circuit <b>8</b>, which is configured to perform power conversion of output power of the boost converter circuit <b>3</b> and to supply the resultant power to the electric heater (internal load) <b>60</b>, and controls the boost converter circuit <b>3</b>, the inverter circuit <b>5</b>, the disconnection mechanism <b>7</b>, and the buck converter circuit <b>8</b> in order to prevent power from flowing back from the power system to the output of the inverter circuit <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0035">If the output power of the inverter circuit <b>5</b> is in interconnection with the power system <b>2</b>, the controller <b>9</b> controls the boost converter circuit <b>3</b> to maintain the output voltage of the boost converter circuit <b>3</b> to be higher than or equal to a first voltage value which is greater than the maximum value of AC voltage of the power system <b>2</b>. In the case of causing the electric heater (internal load) <b>60</b> to consume all of the output power of the DC power source which is the fuel cell body <b>1</b> via the boost converter circuit <b>3</b> and the buck converter circuit <b>8</b>, the controller <b>9</b> controls the boost converter circuit <b>3</b> such that the output voltage of the boost converter circuit <b>3</b> becomes a second voltage value which is less than the maximum value of AC voltage of the power system <b>2</b>.</p>

For example, the first voltage value is preferably 125% to 145% of the maximum value of AC voltage of the power system <b>2</b> from the standpoint of stably supplying power to an external load. Similarly, the second voltage value may be set to any value so long as the set value is less than the maximum value of AC voltage of the power system <b>2</b>. For example, the second voltage value is preferably 35% to 55% of the maximum value of AC voltage of the power system <b>2</b> from the standpoint of causing the electric heater (internal load) <b>60</b> to consume power while suppressing a load on the power switching element Q<b>43</b> of the buck converter circuit <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0037">It should be noted that in the present invention, the term internal load refers to a device that consumes power and that is among the devices included in the system in which the power converter of the present invention is incorporated (in Embodiment 1, the fuel cell system). Moreover, the term external load refers to a device that consumes power and that is other than the devices included in the system in which the power converter of the present invention is incorporated (one example of external load is an electrical appliance used in a house where the fuel cell system is installed). Furthermore, examples of causing an internal load to consume all of the output power of the DC power source which is the fuel cell body <b>1</b> include charging a battery.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0038">In Embodiment 1, the controller <b>9</b> is configured to control each of the power converter <b>100</b> and the fuel cell system <b>200</b>. The controller <b>9</b> may be configured in any form so long as the controller <b>9</b> is configured as a device for controlling the devices included in the power converter <b>100</b> and fuel cell system <b>200</b>. The controller <b>9</b> includes: a microprocessor; an arithmetic processing unit exemplified by, for example, a CPU; and a storage unit configured as a memory or the like which stores a program for performing control operations. Through the loading and execution, by the arithmetic processing unit, of a predetermined control program stored in the storage unit, the controller <b>9</b> performs various controls over the power converter <b>100</b> and the fuel cell system <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0039">It should be noted that the controller <b>9</b> may be configured not only as a single controller, but as a group of multiple controllers which operate in cooperation with each other to control the power converter <b>100</b> and the fuel cell system <b>200</b>. Moreover, the controller <b>9</b> may be configured as a microcontroller. Furthermore, the controller <b>9</b> may be configured as an MPU, PLC (Programmable Logic Controller), logic circuit, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0040">In the power converter <b>100</b> and the fuel cell system <b>200</b> including the power converter <b>100</b> according to Embodiment 1, which are configured as described above, the controller <b>9</b> is configured to control, while the output power of the inverter circuit <b>5</b> is in interconnection with the power system <b>2</b>, the boost converter circuit <b>3</b> such that the output voltage of the boost converter circuit <b>3</b> becomes higher than or equal to the first voltage value which is greater than the maximum value of AC voltage of the power system <b>2</b>. Accordingly, the power converter <b>100</b> and the fuel cell system <b>200</b> including the power converter <b>100</b> according to Embodiment 1 can stably supply power to an external load.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0041">Moreover, in the power converter <b>100</b> and the fuel cell system <b>200</b> including the power converter <b>100</b> according to Embodiment 1, the controller <b>9</b> is configured to control, in the case of causing the electric heater (internal load) <b>60</b> to consume all of the output power of the fuel cell body <b>1</b>, the boost converter circuit <b>3</b> such that the output voltage of the boost converter circuit <b>3</b> becomes lower than or equal to the second voltage value which is less than the maximum value of AC voltage of the power system <b>2</b>. Accordingly, the power converter <b>100</b> and the fuel cell system <b>200</b> including the power converter <b>100</b> according to Embodiment 1 can reduce power loss of the power switching element Q<b>43</b> of the boost converter circuit <b>3</b> even in the case of causing the electric heater (internal load) <b>60</b> to consume all of the output power of the fuel cell body <b>1</b> when there is a fear that a reverse power flow into the power system <b>2</b> may occur, that is, for example, when the power system <b>2</b> momentarily loses power or the power system <b>2</b> is opened for a short period of time due to engineering work performed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0042">Therefore, the power converter <b>100</b> and the fuel cell system <b>200</b> including the power converter <b>100</b> according to Embodiment 1 do not require a large-sized radiation fin for dissipating heat from the power switching element Q<b>43</b> of the buck converter circuit <b>8</b>. Further, unlike the conventional art, it is not necessary to increase, by means of the boost converter circuit <b>3</b>, the output power of the fuel cell body <b>1</b> to be greater than or equal to the first voltage value and then step down, by means of the buck converter circuit <b>8</b>, the output power of the fuel cell body <b>1</b> to a value that corresponds to power consumption by the electric heater <b>60</b>. As a result, power loss at the time of boosting and stepping down the output power can be reduced. Accordingly, the output power can be efficiently converted into heat by means of the electric heater <b>60</b>. This makes it possible to improve the reliability of the fuel cell system <b>200</b> and to reduce the size and cost of the power converter <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0043">Further, in the power converter <b>100</b> and the fuel cell system <b>200</b> including the power converter <b>100</b> according to Embodiment 1, the controller <b>9</b> is configured to open the disconnection mechanism <b>7</b> in the case of controlling the output voltage of the boost converter circuit <b>3</b> to be the second predetermined voltage, which is lower than the maximum value of AC voltage of the power system <b>2</b>, to cause the electric heater (internal load) <b>60</b> to consume all of the output power of the fuel cell body <b>1</b> via the boost converter circuit <b>3</b> and the buck converter circuit <b>8</b>. This makes it possible to prevent power from flowing back from the power system <b>2</b> into the power converter <b>100</b>, thereby further improving the reliability of the fuel cell system <b>200</b>.</p>
