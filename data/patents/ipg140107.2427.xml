<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Disclosed herein are photoconductors comprised of a photogenerating layer and a charge transport layer comprised of a mixture of a charge transport component and a tetraaryl polycarbonate.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Photoconductors that include certain photogenerating layers and specific charge transport layers are known. While these photoconductors may be useful for xerographic imaging and printing systems, many of them have a tendency to deteriorate, and thus have to be replaced at considerable costs and with extensive resources. A number of known photoconductors also have a minimum of, or lack of, resistance to abrasion from dust, charging rolls, toner, and carrier. For example, the surface layers of photoconductors are subject to scratches, which decrease their lifetime, and in xerographic imaging systems adversely affect the quality of the developed images. While used photoconductor components can be partially recycled, there continues to be added costs and potential environmental hazards when recycling.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Thus, there is a need for photoconductors with extended lifetimes and reduced wearing characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is also a need for light shock and ghost resistant photoconductors with excellent or acceptable mechanical characteristics, especially in xerographic systems where biased charging rolls (BCR) are used.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Photoconductors with excellent cyclic characteristics and stable electrical properties, stable long term cycling, minimal charge deficient spots (CDS), and acceptable lateral charge migration (LCM) characteristics are also desirable needs.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, there is a need for photoconductors with suppressed J zone parking deletion, which prevents or minimizes oxidation of the charge transport compounds present in the charge transport layer by nitrous oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>) originating from xerographic corotron devices.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another need relates to the provision of photoconductors which simultaneously exhibit excellent photoinduced discharge and charge/discharge cycling stability characteristics (PIDC) and improved bias charge roll (BCR) wear resistance in xerographic imaging and printing systems.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Moreover, there is a need for scratch resistant photoconductive surface layers.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">These and other needs are believed to be achievable with the photoconductors disclosed herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A number of known components can be selected for the various photoconductor layers, such as the supporting substrate layer, the photogenerating layer, the charge transport layer mixture, the ground plane layer when present, the hole blocking layer when present, and the adhesive layer when present.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Supporting Substrates</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The thickness of the photoconductor supporting substrate layer depends on many factors, including economical considerations, the electrical characteristics desired, adequate flexibility properties, availability, and cost of the specific components for each layer, and the like, thus this layer may be of a substantial thickness, for example about 2,500 microns, such as from about 100 to about 2,000 microns, from about 400 to about 1,000 microns, or from about 200 to about 600 microns (&#x201c;about&#x201d; throughout includes all values in between the values recited), or of a minimum thickness. In embodiments, the thickness of this layer is from about 70 to about 300 microns, or from about 100 to about 175 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The photoconductor substrate may be opaque or substantially transparent, and may comprise any suitable material including known or future developed materials. Accordingly, the substrate may comprise a layer of an electrically nonconductive or conductive material such as an inorganic or an organic composition. As electrically nonconducting materials, there may be employed various resins known for this purpose including polyesters, polycarbonates, polyamides, polyurethanes, and the like, which are flexible as thin webs. An electrically conducting substrate may be any suitable metal of, for example, aluminum, nickel, steel, copper, gold, and the like, or a polymeric material, as described above, filled with an electrically conducting substance, such as carbon, metallic powder, and the like, or an organic electrically conducting material. The electrically insulating or conductive substrate may be in the form of an endless flexible belt, a web, a rigid cylinder, a sheet, and the like. The thickness of the substrate layer depends on numerous factors, including strength desired, and economical considerations. For a drum, this layer may be of a substantial thickness of, for example, up to many centimeters or of a minimum thickness of less than a millimeter. Similarly, a flexible belt may be of a substantial thickness of, for example, about 250 microns, or of a minimum thickness of less than about 50 microns provided there are no adverse effects on the final electrophotographic device.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In embodiments where the substrate layer is not conductive, the surface thereof may be rendered electrically conductive by an electrically conductive coating. The conductive coating may vary in thickness over substantially wide ranges depending upon the optical transparency, degree of flexibility desired, and economic factors.</p>

In embodiments, the substrate is in the form of a seamless flexible belt. In some situations, it may be desirable to coat on the back of the substrate, particularly when the substrate is a flexible organic polymeric material, an anticurl layer, such as for example polycarbonate materials commercially available as MAKROLON&#xae;.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Anticurl Layer</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some situations, it may be desirable to coat an anticurl layer on the back of the photoconductor substrate, particularly when the substrate is a flexible organic polymeric material. This anticurl layer, which is sometimes referred to as an anticurl backing layer, minimizes undesirable curling of the substrate. Suitable materials selected for the disclosed photoconductor anticurl layer include, for example, polycarbonates commercially available as MAKROLON&#xae;, polyesters, and the like.

During hydrolysis of the aminosilanes, the hydrolyzable groups, such as the alkoxy groups, are replaced with hydroxyl groups. The pH of the hydrolyzed silane solution can be controlled to from about 4 to about 10, or from about 7 to about 8 to thereby result in photoconductor electrical stability. Control of the pH of the hydrolyzed silane solution may be affected with any suitable material, such as generally organic acids or inorganic acids. Examples of organic and inorganic acids selected for pH control include acetic acid, citric acid, formic acid, hydrogen iodide, phosphoric acid, hydrofluorosilicic acid, p-toluene sulfonic acid, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The hole blocking layer can, in embodiments, be prepared by a number of known methods, the process parameters being dependent, for example, on the photoconductor member desired.

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Photogenerating Layer</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Usually, the disclosed photoconductor photogenerating layer is applied by vacuum deposition or by spray drying onto the supporting substrate, and a charge transport layer or a plurality, from about 2 to about 5 of charge transport layers are formed on the photogenerating layer. The charge transport layer may be situated on the photogenerating layer, the photogenerating layer may be situated on the charge transport layer, or when more than one charge transport layer is present, they can be contained on the photogenerating layer.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In embodiments, charge transport refers, for example, to charge transporting molecules that allows the free charges generated in the photogenerating layer to be transported across the charge transport layer. The charge transport layer is usually substantially nonabsorbing to visible light or radiation in the region of intended use, but is electrically active in that it allows the injection of photogenerated holes from the photoconductive layer, or photogenerating layer, and permits these holes to be transported to selectively discharge surface charges present on the surface of the photoconductor.</p>

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The photoconductor wear rates when selecting for the charge transport layer a mixture of a charge transport compound and the tetraaryl polycarbonates illustrated herein is, for example, reduced by from about 30 to about 70 percent, and more specifically, from about 40 to about 60 weight percent as compared to a similar known photoconductor that is free of the charge transport layer tetraaryl polycarbonate. Thus, the tetraaryl polycarbonate containing photoconductor wear rate, measured using an in-house known wear fixture as illustrated herein is from about 30 to about 55, or from about 35 to about 50 nanometers/kilocycles.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In addition to improved wear characteristics, the disclosed photoconductors have color print stability and excellent cyclic stability of almost no or a minimal change in a generated known photoinduced discharge curve (PIDC), especially no or minimal residual potential cycle up after a number of charge/discharge cycles of the photoconductor, for example about 100 kilocycles, or xerographic prints of, for example, from about 80 to about 100 kiloprints. Color print stability refers, for example, to substantially no or minimal change in solid area density, especially in 60 percent halftone prints, and no or minimal random color variability from print to print after a number of xerographic prints, for example 50 kiloprints.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Also included within the scope of the present disclosure are methods of imaging and printing with the photoconductor devices illustrated herein. These methods generally involve the formation of an electrostatic latent image on the imaging member, followed by developing the image with a toner composition comprised, for example, of a thermoplastic resin, a colorant, such as a pigment, dye, or mixtures thereof, a charge additive, internal additives like waxes, and surface additives, such as for example silica, coated silicas, aminosilanes, and the like, reference U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,560,635 and 4,338,390, the disclosures of each of these patents being totally incorporated herein by reference, subsequently transferring the toner image to a suitable image receiving substrate, and permanently affixing the image thereto. In those environments wherein the photoconductor is to be used in a printing mode, the imaging method involves the same operation with the exception that exposure can be accomplished with a laser device or image bar. More specifically, the flexible photoconductor belts disclosed herein can be selected for the Xerox Corporation iGEN&#xae; machines that generate with some versions over 110 copies per minute. Processes of imaging, especially xerographic imaging and printing, including digital and/or color printing, are thus encompassed by the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The imaging members or photoconductors illustrated herein are, in embodiments, sensitive in the wavelength region of, for example, from about 400 to about 900 nanometers, and in particular from about 650 to about 850 nanometers, thus diode lasers can be selected as the light source. Moreover, the imaging members of this disclosure are useful in color xerographic applications, particularly high-speed, for example at least 100 copies per minute, color copying and printing processes.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The following Examples are being submitted to illustrate embodiments of the present disclosure. Molecular weights were determined by Gel Permeation analysis. The ratios recited were determined primarily by the amount of components selected for the preparations indicated.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Comparative Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">An undercoat layer was prepared, and then deposited on a 30 millimeter thick aluminum drum substrate as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Zirconium acetylacetonate tributoxide (35.5 parts), &#x3b3;-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (4.8 parts), and poly(vinyl butyral) BM-S (2.5 parts) were dissolved in n-butanol (52.2 parts). The resulting solution was then coated by a dip coater on the above 30 millimeter thick aluminum drum substrate, and the coating solution layer was pre-heated at 59&#xb0; C. for 13 minutes, humidified at 58&#xb0; C. (dew point=54&#xb0; C.) for 17 minutes, and dried at 135&#xb0; C. for 8 minutes. The thickness of the resulting undercoat layer was approximately 1.3 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A photogenerating layer, 0.2 micron in thickness, comprising chlorogallium phthalocyanine (Type C) was deposited on the above undercoat layer. The photogenerating layer coating dispersion was prepared as follows. 2.7 Grams of chlorogallium phthalocyanine (ClGaPc) Type C pigment were mixed with 2.3 grams of the polymeric binder (carboxyl-modified vinyl copolymer, VMCH, available from Dow Chemical Company, 15 grams of n-butyl acetate, and 30 grams of xylene. The resulting mixture was mixed in an Attritor mill with about 200 grams of 1 millimeter Hi-Bea borosilicate glass beads for about 3 hours. The dispersion mixture obtained was then filtered through a 20 micron Nylon cloth filter, and the solids content of the dispersion was diluted to about 6 weight percent.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Subsequently, a 32 micron charge transport layer was coated on top of the above photogenerating layer from a solution prepared by dissolving N,N-diphenyl-N,N-bis(3-methylphenyl)-1,1&#x2032;-biphenyl-4,4&#x2032;-diamine (mTBD, 4 grams), and a film forming polymer binder PCZ-400[poly(4,4&#x2032;-dihydroxy-diphenyl-1-1-cyclohexane carbonate), M<sub>w</sub>=40,000] available from Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Ltd. (6 grams), and 0.1 gram of a butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), in a 70/30 solvent mixture of tetrahydrofuran (THF)/toluene, followed by drying in an oven at about 120&#xb0; C. for about 40 minutes. The resulting charge transport layer PCZ-400/mTBD/BHT ratio was 59.4/39.6/1.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example I</heading>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">A photoconductor was prepared by repeating the process of Comparative Example 1 except that the 32 micron thick charge transport layer was coated on top of the photogenerating layer from a solution prepared from a mixture of N,N&#x2032;-diphenyl-N,N-bis(3-methylphenyl)-1,1&#x2032;-biphenyl-4,4&#x2032;-diamine (mTBD), 39.6 weight percent, 59.4 weight percent of the tetraaryl polycarbonate copolymer obtained from Mitsubishi Chemical Company and identified herein as C80PPA20, where m is 80 mol percent and n is 20 mol percent, and the viscosity average molecular weight was 62,300 as determined by GPC analysis, and 1 weight percent of the butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) dissolved in a solvent mixture of tetrahydrofuran/toluene 70/30. The 32 micron thick charge transport layer resulting comprised C80PPA20/mTBD/BHT in a 59.4/39.6/1 ratio.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Electrical Property Testing</heading>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The above prepared photoconductors of Comparative Example 1 and Example I were tested in a scanner set to obtain photoinduced discharge cycles, sequenced at one charge-erase cycle followed by one charge-expose-erase cycle, wherein the light intensity was incrementally increased with cycling to produce a series of photoinduced discharge characteristic curves from which the photosensitivity and surface potentials at various exposure intensities were measured. Additional electrical characteristics were obtained by a series of charge-erase cycles with incrementing surface potential to generate several voltage versus charge density curves. The scanner was equipped with a scorotron set to a constant voltage charging at various surface potentials. The above photoconductors were tested at surface potentials of 700 volts with the exposure light intensity incrementally increased by means of regulating a series of neutral density filters; and the exposure light source was a 780 nanometer light emitting diode. The xerographic simulation was completed in an environmentally controlled light tight chamber at ambient conditions (40 percent relative humidity and 22&#xb0; C.).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Substantially similar PIDCs were obtained for the above two photoconductors. Therefore, the incorporation of the above tetraaryl polycarbonate of Example I did not adversely affect the electrical properties of this photoconductor.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Wear Testing</heading>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Wear tests of the photoconductors of Comparative Example 1 and Example I were performed using an in house wear test fixture (biased charging roll, and BCR charging with peak to peak voltage of 1.8 kilovolts). The total thickness of each photoconductor was measured via Permascope before each wear test was initiated. Then the photoconductors were separately placed into the wear fixture for 100 kilocycles. The total photoconductor thickness was measured again with the Permascope, and the difference in thickness was used to calculate wear rate (nanometers/kilocycle) of the photoconductors. The smaller the wear rate, the more wear resistant was the photoconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">There resulted an improved wear rate of 46.0 nm/kcycle for the Example I photoconductor versus a wear rate of 65.8 nm/kcycle for the Comparative Example 1 photoconductor, which represents a 67 percent wear rate improvement for the Example I photoconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Thus, it is expected, in accordance with the principles of the teachings of the present disclosure, that photoconductors possessing wear rates of from about 35 to about 55 nm/kcycle, from about 40 to about 50 nm/kcycle, or better can be achieved.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example II</heading>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Two photoconductors are prepared by repeating the process of Example I except that the tetraaryl polycarbonate copolymer C80PPA20 is replaced with Z80PPA20, where m is 80 mol percent, n is 20 mol percent, and the viscosity average molecular weight is 64,600 as determined by GPC analysis, and A80PPA20, where m is 80 mol percent, n is 20 mol percent and the viscosity average molecular weight is 62,600.</p>
