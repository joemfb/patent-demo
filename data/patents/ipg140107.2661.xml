<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Current photolithography has reached fundamental printing limits. One process that is gaining recognition for use in DRAM and NAND flash manufacturing is sidewall spacer &#x201c;line doubling&#x201d;, sometimes also referred to as &#x201c;line multiplication&#x201d;, &#x201c;frequency doubling&#x201d;, or &#x201c;pitch-halving&#x201d;. The process also has application in making nanoimprint templates, which may be used for making bit-patterned-media magnetic recording disks, for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,758,981 B2 which is assigned to the same assignee as this application.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The process uses sidewall spacers to create patterned hardmasks as a means of doubling the printed line density. The process is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1F</figref>. A layer of hardmask material is deposited on a substrate, and a layer of mandrel material (which may be a photoresist) is patterned into lines on the hardmask layer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). A conformal layer of spacer material is deposited on the tops and sides of the mandrel lines and on the hardmask layer in the gaps between the mandrel lines (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). The spacer material on the tops of the mandrel lines and in the gaps between the mandrel lines is then removed by anisotropic etching, leaving the mandrel lines with sidewalls of spacer material (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). The material of the mandrel lines is then removed, leaving lines of sidewall spacer material on the hardmask layer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>). The number of spacer lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> is double the number of mandrel lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, and thus the pitch of the spacer lines is half the pitch of the mandrel lines, hence the terms &#x201c;line doubling&#x201d; and &#x201c;pitch halving&#x201d;. The spacer lines are then used as an etch mask to transfer the pattern into the hardmask (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>) and the spacer lines are then removed, leaving a pattern of hardmask lines on the substrate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is one method of depositing various types of spacer materials. ALD is a thin film deposition process that is based on the sequential use of a gas phase chemical process, in which by repeatedly exposing gas phase chemicals known as the precursors to the growth surface and activating them at elevated temperature, a precisely controlled thin film is deposited in a conformal manner. Many ALD processes are &#x201c;energy-assisted&#x201d;, meaning that they are performed with the assistance from a plasma or ozone.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention relates to a method for sidewall spacer line doubling using thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) of a titanium oxide (TiOx) spacer layer. A hardmask layer is deposited on a suitable substrate. An optional transfer layer may deposited on the hardmask layer. A mandrel layer, preferably a layer of diamond-like carbon (DLC) is deposited on the hardmask layer or optional transfer layer. The mandrel layer is patterned into a plurality of stripes with tops and sidewalls. A layer of spacer material, consisting essentially of titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>), is deposited, by thermal ALD without the assistance of plasma or ozone, on the tops and sidewalls of the mandrel stripes and on the hardmask layer between the mandrel stripes. Thermal ALD of the TiO<sub>2</sub>, without energy assistance by plasma or ozone, has been found to cause no damage to DLC mandrel stripes. The spacer material on the tops of the mandrel stripes and on the hardmask layer between the mandrel stripes is then removed by anisotropic etching, leaving the mandrel stripes and sidewall TiO<sub>2 </sub>spacer material. Then the mandrel stripes are etched away, leaving stripes of TiO<sub>2 </sub>sidewall spacer material on the hardmask layer. The TiO<sub>2 </sub>stripes are used as an etch mask to etch away the exposed hardmask layer. The TiO<sub>2 </sub>stripes are removed, leaving a pattern of hardmask stripes on the substrate that is double the number of original mandrel stripes. The patterned hardmask may be used as an etch mask to transfer the pattern into the substrate.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a thin film deposition process that is based on the sequential use of a gas phase chemical process, in which by repeatedly exposing gas phase chemicals known as the precursors to the growth surface and activating them at elevated temperature, with or without the assistance from a plasma or ozone, a precisely controlled thin film is deposited in a conformal manner. If plasma is involved in the deposition, the technique is referred to as &#x201c;plasma-enhanced&#x201d; ALD, or PEALD. If ozone is used in the deposition, the process is called &#x201c;ozone-assisted&#x201d; ALD. PEALD and ozone-assisted ALD are both referred to as &#x201c;energy-assisted&#x201d; ALD. When the precursors are activated without additional energy assistance from plasma or ozone, the technique would be referred to as &#x201c;thermal&#x201d; ALD.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the method of this invention, it has been discovered that conformal coating of a titanium oxide (TiOx) spacer material over mandrel lines of diamond-like carbon (DLC) occurs without damage to the DLC mandrel lines if thermal ALD is used. However if either plasma or ozone is involved during the deposition of the TiOx spacer material, the narrow DLC mandrel lines may be damaged. Thus in the process of this invention the deposition of TiOx by ALD does not involve the use of plasma or ozone. Thermal ALD, without energy assistance by plasma or ozone causes no damage to the mandrel lines.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The sidewall spacer line doubling method of this invention using thermal ALD of TiOx will be described with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1M</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the substrate <b>200</b> is a suitable material which may be, but is not limited to, Si, fused silica, or glass, and which may also be coated with materials such as a silicon oxide, a silicon nitride, carbon, tantalum, molybdenum, chromium, alumina or sapphire. A hardmask layer <b>205</b> of a material that is resistant to the subsequent etch chemistry of the substrate <b>205</b> is deposited on the substrate <b>200</b>. The hardmask layer may be, but is not limited to, a metal such as Cr, or an oxide or nitride of Cr (CrOx or CrNx) of between about 3-10 nm thickness, or carbon, such as DLC, of between about 10-100 nm thickness. An optional transfer layer <b>210</b> is deposited on the hardmask layer <b>205</b>. The material of the transfer layer may be, but is not limited to, amorphous Si, or a silicon nitride (SiNx). The thickness of the transfer layer is typically between about 3-20 nm. The transfer layer <b>210</b> facilitates adhesion between the hardmask layer <b>205</b> and the subsequently deposited DLC layer, and allows over etching of the spacer material for a wider process window during the later etch-back without damaging the hardmask layer which may result in uneven etch depth in subsequent steps.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a mandrel layer <b>300</b> is deposited on the transfer layer <b>210</b>. If the optional transfer layer <b>210</b> is not used, then the mandrel layer <b>300</b> is deposited on the hardmask layer <b>205</b>, or on an adhesion layer (not shown) formed on the hardmask layer. The preferred material of the mandrel layer <b>300</b> to work with TiOx spacers deposited by thermal ALD (described below) is diamond-like-carbon (DLC). The mandrel layer <b>300</b> of DLC can be deposited using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or physical vapor deposition (PVD). The strong mechanical property of DLC, as compared to other polymeric based materials, ensures high pattern fidelity, especially for critical dimensions less than 20 nm. The thickness of the mandrel layer <b>300</b> is determined by the desired pattern size and height, but is generally between about 10-300 nm. Additional layers of materials (not shown), such as a resist or block copolymer and/or a hardmask material (dissimilar to hardmask layer <b>205</b>) such as SiO<sub>2 </sub>or SiNx, may be deposited on top of the mandrel layer <b>300</b> for the initial patterning to allow the lithography and transfer etching into the mandrel layer <b>300</b> in the next step.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> the mandrel layer is patterned into periodic stripes <b>302</b>. The patterning into the stripes <b>302</b> may be achieved using e-beam lithography, optical lithography, nanoimprint lithography, directed self assembly of block copolymers, or a combination thereof, and related etch techniques. The periodic stripes <b>302</b> pitch, in the direction parallel to the substrate and orthogonal to the stripes, is 2p<sub>0</sub>, i.e., two times the desired pitch of the final line patterns. The width (w) of the stripes <b>302</b> must be less than the final pitch p<sub>0 </sub>of the final line patterns. The choice of the width (w) is typically chosen to be close to p<sub>0</sub>/2, half of the desired pitch of the final line patterns. Portions of the underlying transfer layer <b>210</b> are exposed in the gaps <b>216</b> between stripes <b>302</b>. The width of gaps <b>216</b> at this step is 2p<sub>0</sub>&#x2212;w, the difference between two times the pitch p<sub>0 </sub>of the final lines and the mandrel stripe width w. In the present example, the initial patterning is done using e-beam directed self-assembly of a block copolymer polystyrene-block-polymethylmethacrylate (PS-b-PMMA), followed by pattern transfer into the DLC. The desired pitch p<sub>0 </sub>of the final patterns is approximately 14.5 nm, and therefore the pitch of DLC stripes <b>302</b> is patterned to be 29 nm. The width w of DLC stripes <b>302</b> is approximately 8.8 nm. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> is a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image top view of the structure represented by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, where the lighter lines are the DLC lines <b>302</b> with a 29 nm pitch and the darker lines are transfer layer <b>205</b> in the gaps <b>216</b>. The stripes <b>302</b> may be patterned as parallel generally straight stripes if the resulting etched substrate is to be used in a semiconductor device. The stripes <b>302</b> may be patterned as either generally radial stripes or generally concentric circular stripes if the resulting etched substrate is to be used as an imprint mold for making bit-patterned-media magnetic recording disks.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the next step, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, a titanium oxide (TiOx) spacer layer <b>400</b> is deposited on the top and sidewalls of DLC stripes <b>302</b>, as well as on the portions of the transfer layer <b>210</b> in gaps <b>216</b>. The layer <b>400</b> is deposited in a conformal manner to a uniform thickness t, using thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD), while the substrate is heated to a temperature between about 100&#xb0; C. and 300&#xb0; C., without the use of plasma or ozone. The thickness t is chosen to be p<sub>0</sub>&#x2212;w, the difference between the desired pitch of the final line patterns and the width of the DLC stripes <b>302</b>. At this step, the width of the gaps <b>216</b>&#x2032; is reduced to w. In the present example, the thermal ALD of TiOx is carried out at 250&#xb0; C. The precursors used for TiOx deposition were tetrakis(dimethylamido)titanium (TDMAT) and water vapor. Alternatively, other titanium containing precursors could be used in conjunction with water, such as titanium tetrachloride (TiCl<sub>4</sub>) and titanium butoxide (Ti(OBu)<sub>4</sub>). The TiOx layer <b>400</b> deposited by thermal ALD in this manner consists essentially of titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>). The targeted thickness t of the TiOx layer is approximately 5.7 nm. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref> shows a top view SEM image of a section of the TiOx coated lines of 29 nm pitch, where the lighter lines is the TiOx on top of the DLC stripes <b>302</b> and the darker lines is the TiOx in the narrowed gaps <b>216</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>, an anisotropic etch in a direction perpendicular to the substrate surface is carried out to etch back the TiOx spacer material. The etch-back of TiOx can be done using reactive ion etching (RIE) with an etchant gas containing fluorine and/or chlorine or by ion beam (Ar) etching. The DLC stripes <b>302</b> may also be shortened by the etch chemistry. The vertical thickness of the spacer material to be removed by the etch step should be at least t, the initial layer thickness of the TiOx spacer material. This will ensure the removal of the TiOx spacer material on top of DLC stripes <b>302</b>, and in the narrowed gaps <b>216</b>&#x2032;, leaving only stripes <b>405</b> of TiOx spacer material covering the sidewalls of DLC stripes <b>302</b>. An overetch of the spacer material (vertical thickness removed more than t) is typically used to allow a wide process window, and therefore portions of the transfer layer <b>210</b> may also be etched in the narrowed gaps <b>216</b>&#x2032;. Hardmask layer <b>205</b> is not etched in this step. The lateral width of all TiOx spacer stripes <b>405</b> is t, the as-deposited thickness of TiOx. The TiOx stripes <b>405</b> have a pitch of p<sub>0</sub>, the desired pitch of the final patterns. In the present example, the etch process is a fluorine-containing RIE process, and the resulting height h of TiOx spacers <b>405</b> is approximately 14 nm. A top view SEM image of the structure represented by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>, in which the light lines are the remaining TiOx <b>405</b> spacer lines, the gray lines are the DLC stripes <b>302</b>, and the dark lines are the narrowed gaps <b>216</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The remaining mandrel stripes <b>302</b> are subsequently removed. In the case where the DLC is the preferred mandrel material, the removal can be done using an oxygen-containing (e.g., O<sub>2</sub>, CO, CO<sub>2</sub>) RIE, or a hydrogen-containing RIE, or a combination thereof. In the resulting structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref>, only TiOx spacers <b>405</b> of pitch p<sub>0 </sub>and width t are left on top of the transfer layer <b>210</b>, separated by gaps <b>216</b>&#x2032; and <b>316</b>. A top view SEM image of the structure represented by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2J</figref>, in which the light lines are the remaining TiOx spacer stripes with a 14.5 nm pitch.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The line patterns <b>405</b> defined by TiOx spacers in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref> can be transferred to the hardmask layer <b>205</b> through two etch steps, the first step etches through the transfer layer <b>210</b>, and the second etch step through the hardmask layer <b>205</b>. The resulting structure is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2K</figref>. The first step may be a fluorine-containing RIE if the material of the transfer layer <b>210</b> is Si or SiNx. The second etch step can be an oxygen containing (e.g., O<sub>2</sub>, CO, CO<sub>2</sub>) RIE if the material of the hardmask <b>205</b> is DLC, or a chlorine-containing RIE or an ion beam etch if the material of the hardmask layer <b>205</b> is Cr (or CrOx or CrNx). During the two etch steps, the TiOx spacers <b>405</b> may also be shortened by the etch chemistry or ion bombardment.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">To ensure a complete and uniform pattern transfer into the substrate, it is preferred to remove the remaining TiOx spacers <b>405</b> after the patterning of the hardmask layer <b>205</b>. The TiOx spacers can be removed in boiled sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), or a mixture of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). It is also optional to remove the remaining material of transfer layer <b>210</b> using wet chemistry such as hydrofluoric acid (HF). The resulting structure is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2L</figref>, with only patterned hardmask stripes <b>206</b> remaining on top of the substrate <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The line patterns with pitch p<sub>0 </sub>may then be etched into the substrate <b>200</b> with the patterned hardmask layer <b>205</b>, followed by the removal of the hardmask layer. The final structure, stripes of substrate pillars (or recesses) with pitch p<sub>0 </sub>in the substrate <b>200</b>, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2M</figref>.</p>
