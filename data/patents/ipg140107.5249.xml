<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments of the invention relate generally to power management and the like, and more particularly, to an apparatus, a system, a method, and a computer-readable medium for providing power controlling functionality to generate configurable power signals and to deliver power during fault conditions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Traditional techniques for providing power switching functionality to generate configurable power signals and to deliver power during fault conditions, while functional, do not readily facilitate the effective power distribution, especially in vehicles. Further, conventional power switching devices generally are not well suited to provide for safety mechanisms (e.g., resolving extreme short circuit conditions).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would be desirable to provide computer-readable media, methods, systems and power controlling apparatuses for reducing the drawbacks commonly associated with provisioning power, and to further provide techniques, for example, to do so during various fault conditions.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A computer-readable medium, a method, a system and a power controlling apparatus are disclosed to, among other things, apply and distribute power in vehicles. According to the various embodiments, a power-controlling apparatus can be configured to control power to an entity consuming power or from an entity producing power as a function of time, sensed parameter, or type of fault. Thus, a power-controlling apparatus can operate as a &#x201c;power router&#x201d; to distribute power among a network of power sources and loads, and to redistribute power depending on a mode of operation and/or a fault condition. In one embodiment, a Power Control Unit (&#x201c;PCU&#x201d;) is configured to operate as a &#x201c;power router.&#x201d; In some examples, a power control unit can deliver at least 250 Amps (e.g., continuously) in one channel operation, and in two channel operation, at least 125 Amps per channel. In some embodiments, the PCU can operate, for example, from 5 Volts to 55 Volts. In various embodiments, the PCU can implement one or more of the following: configurable (e.g., over network like CAN) short circuit detection, configurable subtle over current detection, configurable extreme over voltage/under voltage detection, configurable, subtle over voltage/under voltage detection, configurable extreme over temperature, configurable subtle over temperature detection, configurable Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)-based waveforms, configurable PWM ramp-up/ramp-down of signals, configurable PWM continuous (or nearly so) waveform generation, programmability over a network (such as CAN), reporting of Voltage, Current, Temperature, and the like over a communication network, a network status detection for both network dependent operating modes and robust stand-alone operation. For example, a PCU can distinguish an over current condition from allowed high current conditions through an advanced and configurable fault maturing algorithm, according to one embodiment. In another embodiment, the PCU can respond to over current, over voltage, and under voltage conditions within, for example, 4 milliseconds. In another embodiment, a PCU can be used to control the power contribution from various power sources and/or various energy storage devices that collectively or individually can supply power to a power bus.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is an example of a power control unit in accordance with at least some embodiments of the present invention. As shown in diagram <b>150</b>, a power control unit <b>160</b> includes a waveform control module <b>161</b>, one or more operational profiles <b>162</b>, a mode controller <b>164</b>, a fault detector <b>166</b>, and one or more fault profiles <b>168</b>. Also, power control unit <b>160</b> can include one or more power source input terminals <b>159</b> and one or more power signal output terminals <b>171</b>. At least one power source input terminal <b>159</b> can be configured to receive power from any number of power sources, such as solar cell arrays, batteries, alternators, and the like, and in different forms (e.g., in either DC or AC at various amplitudes). At least one power signal output terminal <b>171</b> can be configured to transmit power signals to any number of power sinks, including loads, such as motors, lights, resistive loads (e.g., heaters), batteries, and the like, and in different forms (e.g., in either DC or AC at various amplitudes and/or at various rates of change). Power control unit <b>160</b> is configured to control a power signal in accordance with a mode of operation and/or a fault condition, and to transmit the power signal to a power sink (e.g., a load).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In view of the foregoing, power control unit <b>160</b> can generate various power signals with programmable power signal waveforms, the power signals being configured to apply shaped waveforms that have relatively high voltage amplitudes (e.g., up to 55 volts, or greater) and/or relatively high current magnitudes (e.g., up to 100 amperes, or greater). As such, power control unit <b>160</b> can facilitate power distribution from any number of power sources (not shown) to a power sink (not shown) that can operate at relatively high voltage amplitudes and/or high current magnitudes. In at least some embodiments, power control unit <b>160</b> can modify power signals based on a mode of operation for either power control unit <b>160</b> or the system of which power control unit <b>160</b> is a part. In at least some embodiments, power control unit <b>160</b> can modify power signals in response to detecting a fault condition, as well as the type of fault that is detected. Further, power control unit <b>160</b> can undertake a corrective action to resolve or accommodate a pending fault to ensure operation of either the power sink or a system containing power control unit <b>160</b>, or both. For example, power control unit <b>160</b> can discriminate between absolute faults (i.e., extreme faults) for a parameter that exceeds a range or threshold that demarcates the boundary of acceptable operation, and nascent faults that mature into a matured fault (i.e., subtle faults) after an interval of time. Absolute faults (i.e., extreme faults) are magnitude-based faults as they predominantly are determined in relation to magnitudes of a parameter, according to some embodiments, whereas nascent faults (i.e., subtle faults) are time-based faults as they predominantly are determined in relation to an amount of time that a parameter is, for example, outside a range of acceptable parameter values during acceptable modes of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In operation, mode controller <b>164</b> is configured to determine one mode of operation from a subset of modes of operation. A mode of operation can be associated with an operational profile from operational profiles <b>162</b>, where the operational profile can include data that describe how power control unit <b>160</b> operates to generate a power signal responsive to a parameter from parameters <b>180</b>. An operational profile can include relationships between a parameter and a power signal as an output, including transfer functions and other mathematically-described relationships between one or more inputs (i.e., parameters) and an output (i.e., the power signal). To illustrate, consider that power control unit <b>160</b> is used in a combat vehicle to operate a fan motor in a combat mode (i.e., fan is to operate to cool, regardless of speed or power to ensure success in combat), in a power conversation mode (i.e., fan is to operate to cool, but at a reduced speed to conserve power), and a silent mode (i.e., fan is to operate to cool, but at a speed to minimize vibrations and/or audible sounds at resonant frequencies). Combat mode can be associated with operational profile <b>162</b><i>a</i>, power conversation mode can be associated with operational profile <b>162</b><i>b</i>, and silent mode can be associated with operational profile <b>162</b><i>c</i>. Examples of operational profiles for various modes of operation are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Further, operational profiles <b>162</b> can include data representing one or more levels of performance, for each mode of operation, for a power sink. So, if the power sink/load is operating out-of-spec (e.g., as determined by a parameter), then power control unit <b>160</b> can generate a power signal to meet a level of performance, even if it abnormally stresses the load. For example, if sand or grit impairs the speed of fan, level of performance might require that fan operate a certain RPM, regardless of the power required to meet the speed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, mode controller <b>164</b> can be configured to select operational profiles <b>162</b><i>a</i>, <b>162</b><i>b</i>, and <b>162</b><i>c</i>, based on the mode of operation, to respectively generate, for example, power signal <b>170</b><i>a</i>, <b>170</b><i>b</i>, and <b>170</b><i>c </i>at one or more power signal output terminals <b>171</b>. Thus, power control unit <b>160</b> can apply power to a device, which can be a load or a power sink, by selecting an operational profile <b>162</b> to deliver power to the device. Power control unit <b>160</b> can generate a power signal <b>170</b> having a waveform shaped (e.g., by waveform control module <b>161</b>) as a function of a selected operational profile. Power control unit <b>160</b> then transmits power signal <b>170</b> to the device, which can be a power sink or a load. Note that the terms &#x201c;power sink&#x201d; and &#x201c;load&#x201d; can refer to any device that operates to consume power, such as a power-consumption device that performs work and an energy storage device (e.g., batteries).

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Waveform control module <b>161</b> can generate a power signal by, for example, shaping a portion of a waveform for one of power signals <b>170</b> to have a rate of change specified by one of operational profiles <b>162</b>. The rate of change can describe a slope for portions of either a trailing edge or a leading edge of a portion of the power signal, according to some embodiments. Waveform control module <b>161</b> can also form another portion of the waveform for one of power signals <b>170</b> to include an amplitude (i.e., a magnitude) specified by one of operational profiles <b>162</b>. In some embodiments, waveform control module <b>161</b> can include a power-on portion of a waveform for one of power signals <b>170</b> and a power-off portion of the waveform. A power-on portion and a power-off portion of a waveform for power signal <b>170</b> can reduce or eliminate transients associated with applying power or removing power from a load. In one example, the power-on portion provides for a soft start of a load (e.g., a motor), whereas the power-off portion provides for a soft stop of the load.

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In at least some embodiments, fault detector <b>166</b> is configured to determine whether a fault condition exists, and, if so, which type of fault relates to the fault condition. Fault detector <b>166</b> can be configured to operate in accordance with one or more fault profiles <b>168</b>. According to one embodiment, each of fault profiles <b>168</b> can include data representing parameter levels, thresholds and ranges that can demarcate a threshold or ranges of values for one or more parameters associated with normal operation. Examples of a fault profile are discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a fault profile <b>168</b> can correspond to an operation profile <b>162</b>. Thus, operating a load in various modes of operation may cause power control unit <b>160</b> to produce various power signal magnitudes and waveforms and to operate in response to different values of parameters. Correspondingly, different fault profiles can be used to determine faults and fault types for different values of parameters in different modes of operation. Upon detecting a fault, fault detector <b>166</b> can initiate a fault action from fault actions <b>169</b>, which include data representing a set of actions that can be undertaken to either resolve a fault condition (e.g., shut down operation of a load, increase operation of a load, such as a fan when temperature rises above a threshold), or compensate for the fault condition (e.g., if a battery is losing charge without be recharged by an alternator, then power control unit <b>160</b> can operate to meter the application of power to a load to conserve power).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In at least some embodiments, power control unit <b>160</b> can control the application of power during fault conditions. Waveform control module <b>161</b> can be configured to generate a power signal for delivery to a power sink, the power signal having a programmable waveform that has a shape based on a selected operational profile. Fault detector <b>166</b> can monitor a parameter <b>180</b> associated with to determine whether the parameter is within a range of parameter values associated with normal operation of the power sink, or in the normal operation ranges associated with other power sinks. In various instances, parameter <b>180</b> can be associated with the power signal (e.g., voltage, current), the power sink (e.g., the load's temperature), or any other parameter (e.g., ambient temperature). When fault detector <b>166</b> detects a fault as a function of a value for the parameter being noncompliant (i.e., being outside the range of the parameter values or above/below a threshold associated with normal operation), fault detector <b>166</b> initiates a fault action <b>169</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, fault detector <b>166</b> is configured to compare one of parameters <b>180</b> against one or more fault profiles <b>168</b>. Based on the comparison, fault detector <b>166</b> can be configured to classify a fault once detect. For example, fault detector <b>166</b> can classify the fault as being associated with a first subset of faults if the parameter matches at least a portion of fault profile <b>168</b><i>a</i>, as an example. Or, fault detector <b>166</b> can classify the fault as being associated with a second subset of faults if the parameter matches a second fault profile of the one or more fault profiles. In a specific embodiment, the first subset of faults include nascent faults that mature into a fault after some time (e.g., a subtle fault), whereas the second subset of faults can include extreme faults (or absolute faults), which are predominately determined based on relative magnitudes of a parameter. In other embodiments, there can be any number of subset of faults with which to classify faults (e.g., two or more subsets).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Fault detector <b>166</b> classifies a fault as being associated with the first subset of faults by confirming whether the fault is mature. For example, a determination that a fault is mature can include determining that the value for the parameter is associated with a first subset of parameter values, and monitoring an interval of time during which the value for the parameter is associated with the first subset of parameter values. In at least one embodiment, the first subset of parameter can include parameter values associated with a hysteresis region and a subtle fault region, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>. Once the interval of time exceeds a matured fault threshold, then the fault is deemed to be a matured fault (e.g., a matured subtle fault). Optionally, fault detector <b>166</b> can generate an indication that the fault is mature, and thus, is a matured fault, with a fault action subsequently implemented. Such a fault action would be related to faults in the first subset of faults. But note that if fault detector <b>166</b> does not detect that the interval of time exceeds the matured fault threshold, then the fault has yet to mature. According to some embodiments, fault detector <b>166</b> can identify that the fault is nascent (e.g., a subtle fault trigger level has been surpassed), and classify the fault as a nascent fault. Fault detector <b>166</b> then can determine whether the fault is maturing or dematuring. For example, fault detector <b>166</b> can increase a degree of maturity for the nascent fault when the value for the parameter remains associated with the first subset of parameter values. But fault detector <b>166</b> can decrease the degree of maturity for the nascent fault when the values of the parameter are associated with a second subset of parameter values (e.g., values for a normal operation and values associated with a hysteresis region after surpassing a trigger level bounding the normal range of operation). Note that fault detector <b>166</b> can identify the nascent fault as a mature fault when the degree of maturity meets a threshold degree of maturity (i.e., the threshold indicative of a matured fault) Lastly, fault detector <b>166</b> can classify a fault as being associated with a third subset of faults by confirming whether the fault is absolute (e.g., an extreme fault).</p>

In another example, a comparative motor life study could be performed to objectively determine the benefits of implementing a ramp-to-on/ramp-to-off toggle waveform as shown in diagram <b>510</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>.

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Waveform Generator <b>300</b> can be configured to operate with Soft Start and or Soft Stop unit <b>320</b>, according to at least some embodiments of the invention. The normal operation of a switch is to facilitate current to flow (e.g., a switch is closed) or not flow (e.g., a switch is open). In the case of turning a motor on, there can be a high amplitude/short duration current in-rush transient to the motor that has an impact on other components or power sources within a power system. Depending on the motor, electrical currents can peak to significantly higher than normal operating current. When the motor &#x201c;transition from motor-off to motor-on&#x201d; is controlled with PCU Soft Start, the in-rush current is eliminated. The Soft Start functionality of unit <b>320</b> can handle the transition from current minimum to current maximum. Soft Stop functionality of unit <b>320</b> can handle the transition from current maximum to current minimum. In the case of a light, a soft start can gradually turn the light on and soft stop would fade to off. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram <b>700</b> showing an example of a 10 second Soft Start <b>702</b> and a 5 second Soft Stop <b>703</b>, according to one embodiment.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is an example of a flow <b>800</b> for detecting faults using a power control unit, according to at least some embodiments of the invention. A power control unit can implement a fault detection process in accordance with flow <b>800</b> to detect one or more faults relating to any parameter, one or more derived parameters, mathematical expressions based on any one or more parameters, and the like. At <b>802</b>, a parameter (or a value thereof) is obtained or sampled, for example, from a sensor to form an obtained parameter. In various embodiments, flow <b>800</b> can match a parameter (i.e., an obtained parameter) against one or more criteria (i.e., thresholds and/or levels), and can categorize the parameter into one or more fault categories, where different categories of faults can cause different actions (corrective or otherwise) to be undertaken. In this example, flow <b>800</b> determines whether an obtained parameter is associated with either a subtle fault or an extreme fault. As used herein, an &#x201c;extreme fault,&#x201d; at least in some embodiments, refers to a valid fault. In some embodiments, an extreme fault is a value-based fault that need not require a duration of time to determine that a fault condition exists. In some instances, an extreme fault is a critical fault. An extreme fault, in some cases, can require an action to resolve the fault. As used herein, a &#x201c;subtle fault,&#x201d; at least in some embodiments, refers to a fault that is not an extreme fault, but is associated with an obtained parameter that is subtly being disassociated with a normal range or threshold of operation. In some embodiments, a subtle fault can be a time-based fault that matures into fault after some period of time during which parameter value does not comply with values associated with normal operation (i.e., operation during which no faults exist or nascent faults are becoming subtle faults). In some cases, a nascent fault matures into a subtle fault. Thus, a subtle fault can be a function of historic values of the parameter. A subtle fault can invoke actions that may differ from those actions invoked by extreme faults. For example, a subtle fault, once detected, can cause generation of a notification message (e.g., a message notifying a user that such a fault exists for later correction), whereas an extreme fault can cause generation of a power-altering message (e.g., a message that is transmitted from a power control unit to modify the distribution of power in a system implementing one or more power control units). In some instances, a subtle fault requires a maturation process (i.e., fault maturation) to occur over time before a fault can be deemed a subtle fault, the subtle fault maturation process including both a fault maturation determination and a fault dematuration determination. The fault maturation determination is a process by which a subtle fault is determined or categorized. Generally, the fault maturation determination is a function of the degree of degradation of an obtained parameter (e.g., the degree to which a value for a parameter moves away, or diverges, from normal operation) over time. However, a potentially subtle fault need not mature into a subtle fault when the value of the parameter moves toward, or converges upon, the normal operating threshold over time. The fault dematuration determination is a process by which a value for parameter that is associated with a potentially subtle fault (e.g., undergoing fault maturation) can demature into a value that is deemed to be normal.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">At <b>804</b>, a determination is made as to whether the obtained parameter is associated with an extreme fault. In some embodiments, a value of a parameter can be determined to be associated with an extreme fault if the value of the parameter exceeds a threshold. For example, the value can be matched against thresholds <b>920</b> and <b>930</b> to determine whether the parameter relates to region (&#x201c;A&#x201d;) <b>902</b> and region (&#x201c;A&#x201d;) <b>914</b>, respectively, in the diagram of <b>900</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. In at least some embodiments, diagram <b>900</b> can be described as a fault profile that describes the conditions in which a parameter (or a value thereof) is associated with one or more fault conditions. That is, diagram <b>900</b> sets forth various parameter levels, thresholds and ranges for categorizing faults and as well as determining faults (e.g., performing maturation processes). Note that different parameters can have different fault profiles. Note further that a parameter (or the value thereof) can be matched against different fault profiles having different parameter levels, thresholds and ranges. For example, each mode of operation in which a power control unit (as well as the system in which the power control unit operates) can be associated with a corresponding fault profile that has different parameter levels, thresholds and ranges than the other fault profiles.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">If the value is within (or substantially within) either region (&#x201c;A&#x201d;) <b>902</b> or region (&#x201c;A&#x2032;&#x201d;) <b>914</b>, then an extreme fault is detected at <b>806</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. An indication that an extreme fault can be generated at <b>806</b> for consumption by a power control unit or power management application (i.e., to take some sort of action). An indication can be of any form, such as a flag or a message that includes data representing an indication that an extreme fault has been detected. At <b>808</b>, an extreme fault action is performed, such as a preconfigured extreme fault action. For example, the extreme fault action can include an action of &#x201c;communicating the condition&#x201d; to &#x201c;initiating a control action,&#x201d; which can initiate a corrective action. Note that the particular extreme action taken may be different for different modes of operation. For example, a power control unit can operate in a dependent mode under control of, for example, a centralized processor, such as a power management application (&#x201c;PMA&#x201d;) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>. The centralized processor can determine which extreme action the power control unit should take and communicate a message to the power control unit, which, in response to the message, performs the extreme action. Flow <b>800</b> can terminate at <b>810</b>, or can resume fault detection processes to monitor other fault conditions. Further, a power control unit can operate in an independent mode, in which the power control unit determines the extreme action, such as turning off (i.e., power cessation) to the load.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">But if flow <b>800</b> determines that the obtained parameter is not associated with an extreme fault condition, then flow <b>800</b> can continue to <b>815</b> to whether a subtle fault determination is underway (i.e., a potential fault or a nascent exists). If not, then the parameter continues to be evaluated at <b>817</b> to monitor the parameter. If so, then flow <b>800</b> moves to <b>812</b>, at which a determination is made as to whether the obtained parameter exceeds a first trigger level associated with a subtle fault, the first trigger level specifying the initiation of a fault maturation determination. An example of a first trigger level is threshold <b>922</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> (or threshold <b>928</b> for the lower values of the parameter). In some embodiments, a value of a parameter can be determined to be associated with a subtle fault if the value of the parameter exceeds a threshold for a duration of time. For example, the value can be matched against thresholds <b>922</b> and <b>928</b> to determine whether the parameter relates to region (&#x201c;B&#x201d;) <b>904</b> and region (&#x201c;B&#x2032;&#x201d;) <b>912</b>, respectively, in the diagram of <b>900</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. If the value of the parameter is not within region (&#x201c;B&#x201d;) <b>904</b> or region (&#x201c;B&#x2032;&#x201d;) <b>912</b>, then flow <b>800</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> continues in <b>812</b> to determine whether a potential subtle fault has been detected and may be maturing or dematuring. If the parameter is determined to exceed the first trigger level (and have a value, for example, below an extreme fault level) at <b>812</b>, then the subtle fault, as a nascent fault, is maturing at <b>814</b> and an optional indication of the maturing status of the parameter can be generated. Flow <b>800</b> then can continue to <b>827</b> at which a maturation action can be taken to mature the nascent fault. In some examples, a maturation counter can be incremented.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">But if the parameter is determined to not exceed the first trigger level) at <b>812</b>, then flow <b>800</b> continues to <b>820</b>, at which is determination is made as to whether the value of the parameter is within acceptable (i.e., normal) range of values of operation. If so, then a second trigger level has been reached, the second trigger level specifying the initiation of a fault dematuration determination. For example, the value of the parameter can be associated with the valued of region (&#x201c;D&#x201d;) <b>908</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. An example of a second trigger level is threshold <b>924</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> (or threshold <b>926</b> for the lower values of the parameter). The subtle fault, as a nascent fault, is dematuring at <b>822</b> and an optional indication of the dematuring status of the parameter can be generated. Flow <b>800</b> then can continue to <b>826</b> at which a dematuration action can be taken to demature the nascent fault to extinguish the potential fault condition. In some examples, the maturation counter can be decremented, or a dematuration counter can be incremented. If not, then the second trigger level has not been reached and flow <b>800</b> continues to <b>824</b>. Thus, the value of the parameter is between the values associated with the first and second trigger levels, both of which define, for example, a hysteresis region. For example, the value of the parameter can be associated with either region (&#x201c;C&#x201d;) <b>906</b> or region (&#x201c;C&#x2032;&#x201d;) <b>910</b>. Next, flow <b>800</b> continues to <b>825</b> at which a determination is made as to whether a fault maturation determination process is pending (e.g., based on a previously sampled value of the parameter that exceeds the first trigger level). If so, then flow <b>800</b> can continue to <b>827</b> at which a maturation action can be taken to mature the nascent fault. If not, then a fault dematuration determination process is pending and the flow continues to <b>826</b> at which a dematuration action can be taken to demature the nascent fault.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">At <b>829</b>, flow <b>800</b> retrieves information specifying the states of dematuring as determined in <b>826</b> and maturing as determined in <b>827</b>, and the flow can determine the degree of maturity associated with the parameter. For example, a value of a dematuration counter can be subtracted from a value of a maturation counter to determine the degree of maturity. In at least some embodiments, the degree of maturity can represent amount of accumulated time (e.g., an interval of time) that a value of a parameter has exceeded a normal range of operation after a first trigger level is surpassed. Flow <b>800</b> can flow to <b>830</b> at which a determination is made as to whether the potential subtle fault has matured into a fault (e.g., a subtle fault). For example, the degree of maturity determined at <b>829</b> can be compared against a threshold degree of maturity. If the degree of maturity meets or exceeds the threshold degree of maturity, then the nascent fault is deemed to have matured into a subtle fault, which can be indicated at <b>831</b>. At <b>832</b>, a matured subtle fault action can be performed, after which flow <b>800</b> can be terminated at <b>840</b>, or can continue at <b>802</b> (not shown). For example, the subtle fault action at <b>832</b> can include &#x201c;communicating the condition&#x201d; to &#x201c;performing a control action.&#x201d; Note that the matured subtle fault action may be different for different modes of operation. For example, a power control unit can operate in a dependent mode under control of, for example, a centralized processor, such as a power management application (&#x201c;PMA&#x201d;) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>. The centralized processor can determine which matured subtle fault action that the power control unit should take and communicate a message to the power control unit, which, in response to the message, performs the matured subtle fault action. Further, a power control unit can operate in an independent mode, in which the power control unit determines the matured subtle fault action, such as decreasing power applied to a load.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">If the degree of maturity does not meet or exceed the threshold degree of maturity, then the nascent fault is not yet deemed to have matured into a subtle fault, and may continue either maturing or dematuring. Thus, flow <b>800</b> can transition to <b>833</b> to continue evaluating the parameter value to determine whether the nascent fault either matures into a subtle fault or dematures, thereby extinguishing the pending fault condition. Note that the fault profiles and their thresholds, such as thresholds <b>920</b>, <b>922</b>, <b>924</b>, <b>926</b>, <b>928</b>, and <b>930</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, as well as maturation times <b>942</b> and <b>946</b>, can be programmed and stored in, for example, a memory. Note further that the thresholds can also be configured to &#x201c;inactive&#x201d; in some cases. Maturation times <b>942</b> and <b>946</b> can represent threshold degrees of maturity against which a degree of maturity can be matched. In at least some embodiments, more or less than the levels depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> can be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> is an example of a flow for detecting faults using a power control unit in a specific implementation, according to an embodiment of the invention. To illustrate the flow of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, consider the example of the fault profile of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> to determine types of faults, according to at least one embodiment of the invention. The following example of a fault detection process, as applied to motor current, illustrates a fault determination processes that implement at least some of the aspects of flow <b>800</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, consider diagram <b>950</b> is a fault profile for motor current, which is depicted as parameter <b>951</b>, for a window motor during at least one mode of operation. In this example, a window motor is closing a window of a vehicle, and the values of a window motor current (as parameter <b>951</b>) are considered to be within a range of acceptable operation in region (&#x201c;C&#x2032;&#x201d;) <b>960</b>, region (&#x201c;D&#x201d;) <b>958</b>, and region (&#x201c;C&#x201d;) <b>956</b>. Next, consider that a window operated upon by the window motor has ice build-up at a first point of time <b>971</b> (i.e., between (&#x201c;W&#x201d;) <b>990</b> and zone (&#x201c;X&#x201d;) <b>992</b>) and it takes more current than is typical to move the window. Thus, the window current may operate in region (&#x201c;C&#x201d;) <b>956</b> and region (&#x201c;B&#x201d;) <b>954</b> in zone (&#x201c;X&#x201d;) <b>992</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>. In another example, the motor might be bound with sand and grit, causing the current to operate in region (&#x201c;C&#x201d;) <b>956</b> and region (&#x201c;B&#x201d;) <b>954</b>. In yet another example, an object in the path of the window or a short circuit in the motor can cause the current to transition (e.g., quickly transition) over an extreme fault threshold <b>970</b> into region (&#x201c;A&#x201d;) <b>952</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B and 9B</figref>, consider the motor current, as parameter <b>951</b>, is sampled at <b>852</b> of flow <b>850</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, and that the window current transitions over threshold <b>971</b> into region (&#x201c;B&#x201d;) <b>954</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, which is between thresholds <b>972</b> and <b>970</b>. Since the values of the current do not surpass extreme fault threshold <b>970</b>, flow <b>850</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> moves through <b>854</b> to <b>862</b>, at which <b>862</b> determines that the current has entered at least region (&#x201c;B&#x201d;) <b>954</b>. As shown, the values of the current are sampled for an interval of time <b>942</b> within in either region (&#x201c;C&#x201d;) <b>956</b> or region (&#x201c;B&#x201d;) <b>954</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>. During interval of time <b>942</b>, a subtle fault starts to mature at <b>864</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, and flow <b>850</b> continues to <b>876</b> to continue determining that the subtle is maturing (or dematuring). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, the window current transitions back into the normal region (&#x201c;D&#x201d;) <b>958</b> at a second point of time <b>973</b> (between zone (&#x201c;X&#x201d;) <b>992</b> and zone (&#x201c;Y&#x201d;) <b>994</b>). Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, flow <b>850</b> determines that the parameter value associated with pending subtle fault is in normal region (&#x201c;D&#x201d;) <b>958</b> at <b>870</b>. Thus, flow <b>850</b> moves to <b>872</b> while the subtle fault dematures while the current is in either region (&#x201c;D&#x201d;) <b>958</b> or region (&#x201c;C&#x201d;) <b>956</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>. Since the subtle fault does not mature at <b>880</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, then flow <b>850</b> continues, or terminates at <b>890</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, the values of the current steadily increase during interval of time <b>944</b><i>a </i>(i.e., zone (&#x201c;Y&#x201d;) <b>994</b>). Flow <b>850</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> passes through <b>854</b>, <b>862</b>, and <b>870</b> until a determination is made that the values of the current related to a hysteresis region at <b>874</b>. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, another subtle fault begins to mature after point in time <b>975</b>, at which the window motor current exceeds threshold <b>972</b>. Diagram <b>950</b> shows that the current matures during zone (&#x201c;X&#x2032;) <b>996</b> until a subtle fault matured after a time interval <b>944</b><i>b </i>has elapsed at point in time <b>977</b>. Time interval <b>944</b><i>b </i>can be referred to as the threshold degree of maturity, at least in some embodiments. Subsequently, flow <b>850</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> can perform a matured subtle fault action at <b>882</b>, after identifying that a subtle fault has matured at <b>881</b>. The matured subtle fault action can be handled by a power control unit during zone (&#x201d;Z&#x2033;) <b>998</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some cases the power control unit is part of a system that is managed by either a centralized processor or processors (and a power management application (&#x201c;PMA&#x201d;)) or a peer-to-peer management scheme. An example of the former is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> as power management application <b>1010</b>. The power control unit can indicate the subtle fault condition to the power management application <b>1010</b>, and power management application <b>1010</b> can respond with instructions describing how to handle the fault. Fault handling can also be performed by the power control unit, locally, if there is a loss of communication with the power management application <b>1010</b>. In either case, if a subtle fault is occurring, another parameter such as temperature might be considered to determine the best course of action. For example, consider that temperatures are very low (e.g., freezing, below 0 degrees Celsius), and the fault condition is new. The motor may continue to operate with this subtle fault condition. But if temperatures were higher (e.g., higher than freezing, above 0 degrees Celsius), power management application <b>1010</b> might be used to indicate that the motor needs to be repaired (Condition Based Maintenance) or replaced to avoid over-heating, which low temperatures would otherwise minimize. To protect a system (e.g., a system of a motor, wiring, and the like), a power control unit might implement a matured subtle fault action, such as disabling a motor, unless overridden by an operator.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Note in at least some cases, consider that the window current transitions into the region (&#x201c;A&#x201d;) <b>952</b>, and the power control unit validates the fault and is deemed to be an extreme fault. The power control unit could be programmed to eliminate current to an electrical load, thereby protecting the load or preventing fire caused by short circuit arcing. Similar examples can apply to other parameters in other regions. For example, consider that a power control unit is tasked with monitoring a subsystem that maintains a pressure within a range of pressure values, but the subsystem has a slow leak. An under pressure fault condition can be considered as a matured subtle fault in region (&#x201c;C&#x2032;&#x201d;) <b>960</b> or region (&#x201c;B&#x2032;&#x201d;) <b>962</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, whereas an extreme under pressure fault can be detected in region (&#x201c;A&#x2032;&#x201d;) <b>964</b> (i.e., once trigger level <b>980</b> is surpassed). An example of an extreme under pressure fault can be due to a severed hose. Other parameters, such as derivative parameters (e.g., speed, acceleration, and the like) and mathematically derived parameters (e.g., frequencies, and the like), can also be associated with a fault profile, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, so that flow <b>850</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> can be applied thereto.</p>

Note that the power control units, such as power control unit <b>200</b>, can operate in various modes. Different modes allow for different performance levels based on parameters (as measured, for example, by sensors <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b</i>), faults detection threshold, and/or instructions and operational profiles used by power management application <b>1010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> depicts an example of a set of operational profiles for controlling operation of a power control unit, according to at least some embodiments. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a number of different waveforms can be generated by a waveform generator <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> can be determining by specific modes of operation, such as modes A, B, C, and D. Operational profile <b>1120</b> depicts a waveform applied to load, such as a fan motor described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In this example, operational profile <b>1120</b> can be implemented during mode A, which can be a &#x201c;normal operating mode&#x201d; that is configured to optimize power consumption by detecting a temperature <b>1124</b> and producing a current <b>1126</b> as a function of waveform (or relationship) <b>1122</b>. Operational profile <b>1140</b> can be implemented during mode B, which can be a special &#x201c;silent mode&#x201d; that is configured to reduce resonant frequency of a fan motor by reducing current to current <b>1146</b> for a certain temperature <b>1144</b> as a function of waveform (or relationship) <b>1142</b>. Operational profile <b>1160</b> can be implemented during mode C, which can be an &#x201c;operational fault mode&#x201d; that is configured to operate with a pending type of fault by producing current <b>1166</b> at temperature <b>1164</b> as a function of waveform (or relationship) <b>1162</b>. Operational profile <b>1180</b> can be implemented during mode D, which can be a &#x201c;heavy sun&#x201d; mode initiated by a sensed parameter, for example, such as signal generated by a sun sensor indicating heavy sunload. The greater the sunload, the higher the probability that cooling efforts will need to increase. Thus, a power control unit can control a fan (as a load) based on waveform (or relationship) <b>1182</b>, which is configured to remedy a certain heavy sun condition.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> depict examples of bi-directional buck-boost power control units, according to various embodiment of the invention. A Power Control Unit (&#x201c;PCU&#x201d;) can operate in various configurations. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, one such configuration is a bi-directional buck-boost Power Control Unit <b>1200</b>, which includes a controller <b>1202</b> to control switching devices, such as switching devices <b>1212</b>, <b>1214</b>, <b>1216</b>, <b>1218</b>, <b>1222</b>, and <b>1224</b> in a coordinated fashion. Power control unit <b>1200</b> also includes hardware device <b>1232</b>, internal sensors <b>1234</b> and external sensors <b>1238</b>. As such, bi-directional buck or boost current controls <b>1244</b> and <b>1248</b> can be achieved to facilitate interaction between devices <b>1242</b> and <b>1246</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> is a diagram showing an example one implementation of a bi-directional buck-boost power control unit <b>1250</b>, according to one embodiment of the invention. FETs <b>1262</b>, <b>1264</b>, <b>1266</b>, <b>1268</b>, <b>1272</b>, and <b>1274</b> can be controlled by controller <b>1252</b>, and, with transformer <b>1282</b> and sensors <b>1284</b>, <b>1286</b>, and <b>1288</b>, current and voltage can be controlled in a bi-directional buck-boost fashion. In one mode, power can be controlled from battery <b>1294</b> to an energy storage device, such as an ultracapacitor <b>1296</b>. In another mode, power can be delivered from the ultracapacitor <b>1296</b> to a load <b>1292</b>, such as a starter motor, for example. This implementation can be used to manage the charging of an ultracapacitor from an uncharged state. This implementation can also be useful to manage a starting system in extreme cold environments. In extreme cold, large amounts of current draw from a battery severely shortens the life of the battery. A large amount of current is demanded by a starting motor, especially when cold temperatures make engine block fluids viscous. Ultracapacitors can be used to deliver large amounts of current, but use large amounts of current. Using either a bi-directional buck-boost power control unit <b>1200</b> or a bi-directional buck-boost power control unit <b>1250</b> allows for managed current demand from the battery to the ultracapacitor and also allows for the ultracapacitor to deliver current to the starter motor. Other examples may include power control units or other switching devices <b>1212</b>, <b>1214</b>, <b>1216</b>, <b>1218</b>, <b>1222</b>, and <b>1224</b> and other hardware <b>1232</b>, such as inductors. The interconnections between devices can also be configurable. More or fewer elements shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> can be implemented to form bi-directional buck-boost power control units.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some examples, execution of the sequences of instructions can be performed by a single processor-based system <b>1300</b>.
