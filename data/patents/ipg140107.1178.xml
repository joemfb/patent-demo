<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to clamping apparatus for mounting portable devices, and in particular to spring-driven quick release clamping apparatus for portable phones, ipads, and other hand-held portable electronics devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Spring-driven clamps are known for mounting device holders to hold small cameras onto flat screen computer displays for the purpose of web conferencing, the clamp being coupled at the camera's base by a standard &#xbc; inch-20 threaded connection and operated to grip a suitable external mounting surface of the flat screen computer display. However, such known clamps are limited in their ability to provide a universal mounting solution because the external mounting surface for the clamp is limited to a projection surface, such as the flat screen computer display, that is narrow enough to receive the arms of the around it and rigid enough to stand up under the load. Also, the structure of the clamp for receiving the camera device is the standard &#xbc; inch-20 female thread common to virtually all cameras.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A spring-driven mounting apparatus for a portable device. According to one embodiment of the invention, the mounting apparatus includes: a body structured for mounting to a support stand, the body having a base portion substantially covered by a cover portion having a substantially planar exterior interface surface, the base and cover portions substantially enclosing an interior space therebetween with a plurality of peripheral slotted apertures formed therebetween, and further having two pivots in spaced apart positions between the base and cover portions and aligned substantially along one axis of the body. A pair of substantially rigid curvilinear arms is mounted on the two pivots and crossing in a substantially X-shaped pattern, the arms being extended outwardly of the interior space of the body through the peripheral slotted apertures thereof and being independently spreadable about the interface surface of the body cover portion. Each of the arms has an intermediate rotation portion pivotally coupled to one of the pivots, a pair of substantially upright clamping fingers adjacent to opposite distal end portions thereof and positioned externally of the interior space of the body and projected upwardly above the exterior interface surface of the cover portion thereof, and a handle projected therefrom below the exterior interface surface of the cover portion of the body. A resilient biasing member is coupled between attachment points of the arms for resiliently biasing together opposing pairs of the clamping fingers.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to one embodiment of the apparatus, the attachment points for the biasing member are further positioned between the one of the pivots and one of the clamping fingers on each arm.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to another embodiment of the apparatus, the handles are further positioned between the attachment points for the biasing member and one of the clamping fingers on each arm.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to another embodiment of the apparatus, the apparatus has two biasing members. A first one of the biasing members is further coupled between a first one of the pivots and a first one of the clamping fingers on each arm, and a second one of the biasing members is further coupled between a second one of the pivots and a second one of the clamping fingers on each arm.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Although the following discussion is directed toward the present invention for use in conjunction with normally hand-held portable computing device such as tablet computers, for example the type of mobile computer that is operated primarily by touch screen rather than using a physical keyboard, or convertible notebook computers of the type having an integrated keyboard, or hybrid computers of the type having a touch screen and detachable keyboard, those skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention may be utilized to securely mount a wide variety of similar articles at a convenient location. Thus, discussion of the present invention in conjunction with any portable computing device, including but not limited to a tablet computer, a mobile computer or a convertible notebook computer, is by way of example only and not by way of limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As required, a detailed illustrative embodiment of the present apparatus for clamping a portable computing device is disclosed herein. However, techniques, systems and operating structures in accordance with the present apparatus for holding and clamping a portable computing device may be embodied in a wide variety of forms and modes, some of which may be quite different from those in the disclosed embodiment. Consequently, the specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are merely representative, yet in that regard, they are deemed to afford the best embodiment for purposes of disclosure and to provide a basis for the claims herein which define the scope of the present apparatus for holding and clamping a portable computing device. The following presents a detailed description of an illustrative embodiment (as well as some alternative embodiments) of the present apparatus for holding and clamping a normally hand-held portable computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates X-grip holding and mounting apparatus <b>100</b> for use in conjunction with normally hand-held portable computing devices such as but not limited to tablet computers. X-grip mounting apparatus <b>100</b> may include structure for mounting on a support stand, such as but not limited to support stand <b>12</b> as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">X-grip mounting apparatus <b>100</b> is structured for releasably clamping a normally hand-held portable computing device or other normally hand-held device. For example, mounting apparatus <b>100</b> includes a substantially hollow substantially rectangular shaped body <b>122</b> having a base portion <b>128</b> substantially covered by a matingly shaped cover portion <b>130</b>. Base portion <b>128</b> and cover portion <b>310</b> are joined together, for example, by several fasteners. At least a pair of rotationally movable substantially rigid opposing arms <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> extend substantially radially outwardly from body <b>122</b> adjacent to a substantially planar exterior interface surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>of cover portion <b>130</b> of body <b>122</b> cutting across its substantially hollow interior. Arm <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> are rotationally biased toward one another on substantially opposite sides of body <b>122</b> of mounting apparatus <b>100</b>. For example, arms <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> cross in a substantially X-shaped pattern, for example about an axis <b>127</b> of body <b>122</b>, whereby arm portions <b>124</b><i>a</i>, <b>124</b><i>b </i>and <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b </i>of respective arm pairs <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> are substantially opposed one to another.

Tension in spring <b>160</b> operates for biasing together the two pair of arms <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, with respective first and second arm portions <b>124</b><i>a</i>, <b>124</b><i>b </i>and <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b </i>being biased (arrows <b>168</b>) each toward the other within limitations of lengthwise slotted apertures <b>134</b>, whereby opposing clamping fingers <b>132</b> are biased together the into a compressive clamping relationship with the portable computing device positioned therebetween, with arm portions <b>124</b><i>a</i>, <b>124</b><i>b </i>and <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b </i>being rotated substantially about opposite side portions <b>135</b><i>a</i>, <b>135</b><i>b </i>of body <b>122</b>. Thus, arms <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> automatically adjust to secure different sizes of portable computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In contrast, spreading apart the pair of arms <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> is accomplished by operating arm handles <b>141</b> for rotating arm portions <b>124</b><i>a</i>, <b>124</b><i>b </i>and <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b </i>on opposite sides of interface surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>of cover portion <b>130</b> about opposite side portions <b>135</b><i>a</i>, <b>135</b><i>b </i>of body <b>122</b> against the tensive urging force of biasing member <b>160</b>, whereby biasing member <b>160</b> is resiliently tensioned between arm pairs <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Note that arms <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> are movable independently of each other by operation of arm handle <b>141</b> corresponding thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">X-grip mounting apparatus <b>100</b> is operated substantially similarly to mounting apparatus <b>10</b>, as disclosed herein. The portable computing device is inserted into mounting apparatus <b>100</b> as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Body <b>122</b> of mounting apparatus <b>100</b> is mounted on mounting surface <b>20</b> external of mounting apparatus <b>100</b> with interface surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>of cover portion <b>130</b> thereof facing substantially away from external mounting surface <b>20</b>. See, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Outward rotation of arm handles <b>141</b>, i.e., toward opposite side portions <b>135</b><i>a</i>, <b>135</b><i>b </i>of body <b>122</b>, causes respective opposing arm portions <b>124</b><i>a</i>, <b>124</b><i>b </i>and <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b </i>of arm pair <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> to rotate apart (arrows <b>140</b>) around pivot posts <b>143</b>, <b>145</b> within interior <b>131</b> of body <b>122</b> into a rotated apart state, whereby substantially upright opposing fingers <b>132</b> adjacent to ends of arm portions <b>124</b><i>a</i>, <b>124</b><i>b </i>and <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b </i>are rotated apart against the resilient tensive urging force of biasing member <b>160</b>. With arm pair <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> and opposing fingers <b>132</b> thereof being thus rotated apart (arrows <b>140</b>) and restrained in the rotated apart state, the portable computing device is inserted between rotated apart opposing fingers <b>132</b> into a seated position, for example, in a position substantially laminarly juxtaposed to upwardly facing interface surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>of cover <b>130</b> of body <b>122</b>. Clamping of the portable computing device in mounting apparatus <b>100</b> is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">With the portable computing device seated substantially against interface surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>of cover portion <b>130</b>, outwardly rotated arm handles <b>141</b> are released, whereby arms <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> are released. Thereafter, the tensive urging force of biasing member <b>160</b> operates for resiliently urging together (arrows <b>168</b>) the rotated apart opposing arms <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, whereby opposing fingers <b>132</b> are urged into compressive contact with side portions of the portable computing device. Any tablet computer, mobile computer, convertible notebook computer or other portable computing device or similar article may thus be captured between opposing fingers <b>132</b> under the tension of tensive biasing spring <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As disclosed herein for fingers <b>32</b>, here also the design of protective bumpers <b>133</b> on fingers <b>132</b> is optionally altered to space the portable computing device away from interface surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>of cover portion <b>130</b> of body <b>122</b>. For example, a groove or V-notch is formed in a side wall <b>132</b><i>a </i>of one or more of protective bumpers <b>133</b> on fingers <b>132</b>, whereby the portable computing device is captured between protective bumpers <b>133</b> on fingers <b>132</b> in a position spaced away from interface surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>of cover portion <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown here, similarly to clamping finger <b>32</b>, side walls <b>132</b><i>a </i>of protective bumpers <b>133</b> on fingers <b>132</b> are increasingly enlarged distally from arm portions <b>124</b><i>a</i>, <b>124</b><i>b </i>and <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, as illustrated herein, at least an upper portion <b>132</b><i>b </i>of protective bumpers <b>133</b> closes over a portion of the sides of the portable computing device. Side walls <b>132</b><i>a </i>of protective bumpers <b>133</b> are optionally formed of a resilient elastomeric material that compresses against the sides of the portable computing device under compressive force of biasing member <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The portable computing device is removed from mounting apparatus <b>100</b> in a process similar to the reverse of the insertion process. The portable computing device is removed by grasping the computing device and rotating arm handles <b>141</b> outwardly. Arms <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> are responsively rotated outwardly against urging forces (arrows <b>168</b>) of biasing member <b>160</b> away from the sides of the portable computing device to release the device. The portable computing device is thereafter released to be lifted between fingers <b>132</b> and away from interface surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>of cover portion <b>130</b> of body <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">While the preferred and additional alternative embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the inventor makes the following claims.</p>
