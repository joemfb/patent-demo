<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a communication device, a communication system, a mode switching method, and a program.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, human body communication for transmitting/receiving information with a human body as a transmission medium is gaining attention. The human body communication is a communication method of forming a capacitive coupling by applying voltage to a signal electrode that is in contact with or that is brought into proximity of a human body, and transmitting/receiving a signal by using the formed capacitive coupling. This human body communication has advantages in that its power consumption is low compared to wireless communication such as wireless LAN, and in that it has high confidentiality.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, since communication is started by the signal electrode being brought into contact or proximity with a human body, a user can really feel that communication is actually being performed. Thus, realization of an intuitive interface that uses the human body communication is also expected. In relation to the human body communication, JP 2010-21984A discloses a configuration of a communication device that applies a wireless LAN modulation scheme or a communication protocol to the human body communication and that shares structural elements between the wireless LAN and the human body communication.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally, due to specifications such as transmission rate, modulation scheme, communication scheme, and the like, it is difficult for means providing a wireless LAN to maintain a state of waiting for a signal at low power consumption. Accordingly, to suppress power consumption, a mobile phone or the like provided with a wireless LAN function adopts a mechanism for a user to manually switch to a wireless LAN mode at the time of using the wireless LAN. However, the mechanism for a user to take a portable appliance such as the mobile phone out of the pocket or the like and to manually switch to a wireless LAN mode is inconvenient.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, a mechanism of increasing the convenience by using the human body communication that is capable of waiting for a signal at low power consumption is being considered. However, in a case the wireless LAN and the human body communication share the structural elements, as with the communication device described in the patent document mentioned above, a mechanism for a user to manually switch to a human body communication mode at the time of using the human body communication becomes necessary due to the specifications of the wireless LAN. Additionally, the wireless LAN is taken as an example here, but a mechanism for a user to manually activate an exclusive use mode, as with the wireless LAN, is also adopted by Bluetooth (registered trademark; hereinafter, BT), infrared communication, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In light of the foregoing, it is desirable to provide a communication device, a communication system, a mode switching method, and a program which are novel and improved, and which are capable of increasing the convenience of a user by using the human body communication. For example, the present invention aims to enable, by a communication device, start/end of communication such as wireless LAN while a user is wearing the communication device on his/her person.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a communication device which includes a first communication unit for performing communication by a communication scheme, the communication scheme being for applying voltage from a signal electrode that is in contact with or that is brought into proximity of a human body, generating an electric near field on a human body surface and performing transmission, a second communication unit different from the first communication unit, a switching signal detection unit for detecting, from signals intermittently received by the first communication unit, a mode switching signal for switching the second communication unit from a power save mode to a normal mode, and a switching control unit for switching the second communication unit from the power save mode to the normal mode in a case the mode switching signal is detected by the switching signal detection unit.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The communication device may further include a third communication unit different from the first and second communication units. In this case, the mode switching signal includes type information for causing the second communication unit to be selected as a target to be switched from the power save mode to the normal mode, and the switching control unit selects the second communication unit based on the type information included in the mode switching signal detected by the switching signal detection unit, and switches the second communication unit from the power save mode to the normal mode.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The mode switching signal may be an unmodulated carrier. Furthermore, the mode switching signal may be a combination of an unmodulated carrier and a modulated carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The communication device may further include an arithmetic processing unit for generating transmission data. In this case, the second communication unit transmits the transmission data generated by the arithmetic processing unit after being switched from the power save mode to the normal mode by the switching control unit.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a communication device which includes a signal electrode to which voltage is to be applied, a first communication unit for performing communication by a communication scheme, the communication scheme being for applying voltage to the signal electrode that is in contact with or that is brought into proximity of a human body, generating an electric near field on a human body surface and performing transmission, a second communication unit different from the first communication unit, and a switching signal transmission unit for transmitting, by the first communication unit, a mode switching signal for causing communication means, corresponding to the second communication unit, of a counterpart device to switch from a power save mode to a normal mode.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The mode switching signal may include type information for causing the communication means, corresponding to the second communication unit, of the counterpart device to be selected as a target to be switched from the power save mode to the normal mode.

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The communication device may further include an arithmetic processing unit for generating transmission data. In this case, the second communication unit transmits the transmission data generated by the arithmetic processing unit after the communication means of the counterpart device is switched from the power save mode to the normal mode according to the mode switching signal transmitted by the switching signal transmission unit.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The communication device may further include a touch pad for a user to input information by touching it with a part of a body. In this case, the signal electrode is placed near the touch pad.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The communication device may further include a mouse connected by wire or wirelessly. In this case, at least the signal electrode is provided in the mouse.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The second communication unit may be a wireless communication unit providing a wireless LAN function.

<p id="p-0050" num="0051">Before describing an embodiment of the present invention in detail, a principle of human body communication and a use mode of the human body communication will be briefly described.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">[1-1: Principle of Human Body Communication]</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">First, a principle of human body communication will be briefly described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an explanatory diagram for briefly describing a principle of human body communication. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a human body <b>10</b> is wearing a transmitter (portable terminal <b>100</b>) on person. Also, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the human body <b>10</b> is touching a receiver (information processing apparatus <b>200</b>). Furthermore, the transmitter and the receiver each have a signal electrode and a ground electrode. The signal electrodes of the transmitter and the receiver are in contact with the human body <b>10</b>. Additionally, the signal electrodes do not have to be in direct contact with the human body <b>10</b>. For example, clothes or the like may be present between the signal electrodes and the human body <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">Since the human body <b>10</b> is a dielectric, when AC voltage is applied to the signal electrode of the transmitter, an electric field (a near field <b>15</b>) is generated around the human body <b>10</b>. For example, in the case of using a frequency band of 30 MHz, the dielectric constant of the human body <b>10</b> is about 90 and, therefore, a strong near field <b>15</b> is generated on the surface of the human body <b>10</b>. A signal emitted from the signal electrode of the transmitter reaches the signal electrode of the receiver via this near field <b>15</b>. Additionally, a frequency band (for example, 30 MHz or less) that does not use space propagation and that is not strictly restricted by protection guidelines for human body is suitably used for the human body communication.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">Now, what is important here is the behaviour on the ground side which is a return wire for a signal. The ground electrode of the transmitter has a capacitance <b>11</b> to a ground <b>14</b>. Additionally, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the capacitance <b>11</b> is schematically shown by one capacitor, but in reality, a large number of capacitive couplings are formed between the ground electrode and the ground <b>14</b>. The ground electrode of the receiver similarly has a capacitance <b>12</b> to the ground <b>14</b>. Furthermore, a capacitance <b>13</b> is present between the ground electrode of the transmitter and the ground electrode of the receiver. The sum of the capacitances <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, and <b>13</b> will be the return wire for a signal transmitted from the transmitter to the receiver. Additionally, in the case of using a frequency band of 30 MHz, the capacitances <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, and <b>13</b> are sufficiently small values, and thus the external environment has almost no influence on propagation characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">In the foregoing, a principle of the human body communication has been briefly described.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">[1-2: Use Mode of Human Body Communication]</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058">Next, a use mode of the human body communication will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an explanatory diagram for describing a use mode of the human body communication. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a situation where the human body communication is performed between the portable terminal <b>100</b> worn on a user's person and the information processing apparatus <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0059">When a part of the human body <b>10</b> touches the information processing apparatus <b>200</b> and the human body communication is started between the portable terminal <b>100</b> and the information processing apparatus <b>200</b>, the near field <b>15</b> is generated and transmission/reception of information between the portable terminal <b>100</b> and the information processing apparatus <b>200</b> via the human body is enabled. For example, when the human body communication is started, data of an image P stored in the portable terminal <b>100</b> is sent to the information processing apparatus <b>200</b> and the image P is displayed on a display screen of the information processing apparatus <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">Furthermore, personal information data (for example, address book data or the like) input using the information processing apparatus <b>200</b> can be sent to the portable terminal <b>100</b> over the human body communication. Since, according to the human body communication, information is transmitted/received via the human body <b>10</b>, high confidentiality can be achieved compared to the wireless LAN or the like. Accordingly, the human body communication is suitable for transmission/reception of data such as personal information leakage of which is a matter of concern. Additionally, in the use mode illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the floor acts as the ground <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0061">In the foregoing, a use mode of the human body communication has been described.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">2: Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0061" num="0062">In the following, an embodiment of the present invention will be described. The present embodiment relates to a technology of reducing the power consumption of the portable terminal <b>100</b> and the information processing apparatus <b>200</b> by switching a communication mode using the human body communication. The present embodiment also relates to a mechanism of switching the communication mode without a user taking out the portable terminal <b>100</b> worn on the user's person.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0063">[2-1: Functional Configuration of Information Processing Apparatus <b>200</b>]</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0064">First, a functional configuration of the information processing apparatus <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an explanatory diagram for describing a functional configuration of the information processing apparatus <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the information processing apparatus <b>200</b> is mainly configured from a human body communication block <b>201</b>, and an application unit <b>202</b>. The human body communication block <b>201</b> includes a signal electrode <b>211</b>, a ground electrode <b>212</b>, a distributor <b>213</b> (or a high-frequency switch), a human body communication unit <b>214</b>, and an activation signal transmission unit <b>215</b>. Furthermore, the human body communication unit <b>214</b> includes a transmission/reception unit <b>221</b>, a baseband unit <b>222</b>, and an interface unit <b>223</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0066">Additionally, the application unit <b>202</b> provides a main function of a personal computer (hereinafter, a PC). Also, the function of the application unit <b>202</b> is realized by a hardware configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Furthermore, the ground electrode <b>212</b> for forming a part of the return wire in the human body communication may be configured by making use of a ground plane (not shown) of a substrate of the information processing apparatus <b>200</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0067">(Operation at the Time of Transmission)</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0068">First, data to be transmitted to the portable terminal <b>100</b> is output from the application unit <b>202</b>. The data output from the application unit <b>202</b> is input to the baseband unit <b>222</b> via the interface unit <b>223</b>. The baseband unit <b>222</b> modulates the input data and generates a transmission signal. The baseband unit <b>222</b> also performs control of a communication protocol or the like. The transmission signal generated by the baseband unit <b>222</b> is input to the transmission/reception unit <b>221</b>, and is transmitted from the signal electrode <b>211</b> via the distributor <b>213</b>. At this time, the transmission/reception unit <b>221</b> applies AC voltage to the signal electrode <b>211</b> and generates a signal electric field. Additionally, a shortwave band (for example, a frequency band of 30 MHz or less) is used for transmission of the transmission signal.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0069">(Operation at the Time of Reception)</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0070">First, a signal is received by the transmission/reception unit <b>221</b> via the signal electrode <b>211</b>. The signal received by the transmission/reception unit <b>221</b> is input to the baseband unit <b>222</b>. When the received signal is input, the baseband unit <b>222</b> demodulates the input received signal and generates received data. The received data generated by the baseband unit <b>222</b> is input to the application unit <b>202</b> via the interface unit <b>223</b>. When the received data is input, the application unit <b>202</b> performs processing in accordance with the input received data (for example, display of an image in accordance with the received data).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0071">(Activation Signal Transmission Unit <b>215</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0072">As described above, the human body communication unit <b>214</b> is means for providing a fundamental function for the human body communication at the information processing apparatus <b>200</b>. The information processing apparatus <b>200</b> can realize transmission/reception of information by the human body communication by using the function of this human body communication unit <b>214</b>. The information processing apparatus <b>200</b> also includes the activation signal transmission unit <b>215</b>. This activation signal transmission unit <b>215</b> is means for switching a communication mode of the portable terminal <b>100</b> by using the human body communication, and activating a specific communication function.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0073">First, when an input is received from a user, via a touch panel, a keyboard, or the like connected to the application unit <b>202</b>, to activate a specific communication function of the portable terminal <b>100</b>, this input is notified to the baseband unit <b>222</b> from the application unit <b>202</b>. The baseband unit <b>222</b> which has received this notification instructs the activation signal transmission unit <b>215</b> to transmit an activation signal to the portable terminal <b>100</b> using the human body communication. When this instruction is received, the activation signal transmission unit <b>215</b> applies AC voltage to the signal electrode <b>211</b> via the distributor <b>213</b> and generates a signal electric field, and transmits the activation signal to the portable terminal <b>100</b> by using the human body communication.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0074">Additionally, the activation signal transmission unit <b>215</b> may be configured to transmit, as the activation signal, only a carrier (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), or may be configured to transmit, as the activation signal, a carrier to which a specific signal has been added (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Also, a frequency band around 2 MHz, for example, is used for a carrier frequency used at the time of transmission of the activation signal so that the carrier frequency does not overlap with the frequency band used by the human body communication unit <b>214</b>. Furthermore, a configuration where the human body communication unit <b>214</b> and the activation signal transmission unit <b>215</b> shares the signal electrode <b>211</b> is shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, but a configuration where the human body communication unit <b>214</b> and the activation signal transmission unit <b>215</b> use separate signal electrodes is also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0075">(Placement of Signal Electrode <b>211</b> or the Like)</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0076">Here, a supplementary explanation of placement of the signal electrode <b>211</b> will be given with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The signal electrode <b>211</b> is preferably placed at a position convenient for a user according to the form of the information processing apparatus <b>200</b> or the like. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, if the signal electrode <b>211</b> is placed next to a touch pad <b>231</b> (on one side or both sides) of the information processing apparatus <b>200</b>, a user can easily operate the keyboard or the like while touching the signal electrode <b>211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0077">Furthermore, if the signal electrode <b>211</b> is placed next to the touch pad <b>231</b>, the hand is removed from the signal electrode <b>211</b> at the time of the user operating a mouse <b>230</b>. Therefore, the signal electrode <b>211</b> may be provided at a holding portion of the mouse <b>230</b> which is connected to the information processing apparatus <b>200</b> by a USB or the like. Furthermore, the mouse <b>230</b> may have the human body communication block <b>201</b> built therein. Additionally, in the case of mounting the signal electrode <b>211</b> on the housing of the information processing apparatus <b>200</b> or the mouse <b>230</b>, the signal electrode <b>211</b> does not have to be exposed on the surface of the housing of the information processing apparatus <b>200</b> or the mouse <b>230</b>. For example, if the signal electrode <b>211</b> is provided inside a housing formed from plastic, resin, or the like, a capacitive coupling can be formed between the signal electrode <b>211</b> and the human body <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0078">In the foregoing, a functional configuration of the information processing apparatus <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment has been described.</p>

<p id="p-0079" num="0080">Next, a functional configuration of the portable terminal <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an explanatory diagram for describing a functional configuration of the portable terminal <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0081">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the portable terminal <b>100</b> is mainly configured from a human body communication block <b>101</b>, and an application unit <b>102</b>. The human body communication block <b>101</b> includes a signal electrode <b>111</b>, a ground electrode <b>112</b>, a distributor <b>113</b> (or a high-frequency switch), a human body communication unit <b>114</b>, and an activation signal detection unit <b>115</b>. Furthermore, the human body communication block <b>101</b> includes a band-pass filter <b>116</b>, a low-speed clock generator <b>117</b>, a high-speed clock generator <b>118</b>, and a vibration unit <b>119</b>. Furthermore, the human body communication unit <b>114</b> includes a transmission/reception unit <b>121</b>, a baseband unit <b>122</b>, and an interface unit <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0082">Additionally, the application unit <b>102</b> provides a main function of a mobile phone, a PDA, a portable music player, or the like. Also, the function of the application unit <b>102</b> is realized by a hardware configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Furthermore, the ground electrode <b>112</b> for forming a part of the return wire in the human body communication may be configured by making use of a ground plane (not shown) of a substrate of the portable terminal <b>100</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0083">(Communication Mode)</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0084">The portable terminal <b>100</b> has a normal mode and a sleep mode. The normal mode is a state where information can be transmitted/received at high speed by using a high-speed clock generated by the high-speed clock generator <b>118</b>. On the other hand, the sleep mode is a state where the high-speed clock generator <b>118</b> is stopped and only transmission/reception of information at low speed using a low-speed clock generated by the low-speed clock generator <b>117</b> is enabled. In the sleep mode, transmission/reception of information is performed with a low-speed clock, and, therefore, transmission rate of the information may be low but the power consumption can be greatly suppressed. In the case the portable terminal <b>100</b> is in a wait state, the communication mode is set to the sleep mode.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0085">(Operation at the Time of Transmission in Normal Mode)</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0086">First, data to be transmitted to the information processing apparatus <b>200</b> is output from the application unit <b>102</b>. The data output from the application unit <b>102</b> is input to the baseband unit <b>122</b> via the interface unit <b>123</b>. The baseband unit <b>122</b> modulates the input data and generates a transmission signal. The baseband unit <b>122</b> also performs control of a communication protocol or the like. The transmission signal generated by the baseband unit <b>122</b> is input to the transmission/reception unit <b>121</b>, and is transmitted from the signal electrode <b>111</b> via the distributor <b>113</b>. At this time, the transmission/reception unit <b>121</b> applies AC voltage to the signal electrode <b>111</b> and generates a signal electric field. Additionally, a shortwave band (for example, a frequency band of 30 MHz or less) is used for transmission of the transmission signal.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0087">(Operation at the Time of Reception in Normal Mode)</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0088">First, a signal is received by the transmission/reception unit <b>121</b> via the signal electrode <b>111</b>. The signal received by the transmission/reception unit <b>121</b> is input to the baseband unit <b>122</b>. When the received signal is input, the baseband unit <b>122</b> demodulates the input received signal and generates received data. The received data generated by the baseband unit <b>122</b> is input to the application unit <b>102</b> via the interface unit <b>123</b>. When the received data is input, the application unit <b>102</b> performs processing in accordance with the input received data (for example, display of an image in accordance with the received data).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0089">(Switching Operation of Communication Mode)</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0090">Switching from the sleep mode to the normal mode is performed according to an activation signal received from the information processing apparatus <b>200</b>. When an activation signal is received via the signal electrode <b>111</b>, the received activation signal is input to the band-pass filter <b>116</b> via the distributor <b>113</b>. This band-pass filter <b>116</b> is a filter that passes only the frequency band of the activation signal. The activation signal which has passed the band-pass filter <b>116</b> is input to the activation signal detection unit <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0091">The activation signal detection unit <b>115</b> has a low-speed clock (L-CLK) generated by the low-speed clock generator <b>117</b> input thereto via the baseband unit <b>122</b>. Also, the activation signal detection unit <b>115</b> intermittently detects a carrier of an activation signal by the low-speed clock. When an activation signal is input from the band-pass filter <b>116</b>, the activation signal detection unit <b>115</b> detects the input activation signal, and inputs a WakeUp signal to the baseband unit <b>122</b>. This WakeUp signal is a signal for switching from an operation by a low-speed clock (the sleep mode) to an operation by a high-speed clock (the normal mode).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0092">When the WakeUp signal is input, the baseband unit <b>122</b> activates the high-speed clock generator <b>118</b>. Then, the baseband unit <b>122</b> operates the human body communication unit <b>114</b> by the high-speed clock generated by the high-speed clock generator <b>118</b>, and switches the communication mode from the sleep mode to the communication mode. Furthermore, at the time of switching the communication mode from the sleep mode to the normal mode, the baseband unit <b>122</b> turns on the operation of the vibration unit <b>119</b> for a specific period of time, and causes vibration by the vibration unit <b>119</b>. By vibrating the vibration unit <b>119</b> in this manner, a user can be notified of completion of switching to the normal mode.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0093">(2-2-1: Configuration of Activation Signal)</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0094">A supplementary explanation of a configuration of the activation signal will be given here with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a signal configuration for a case where an unmodulated carrier and an on-off keying (OOK) signal are transmitted together as the activation signal. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, first, an unmodulated carrier having a time length Ts is transmitted, and then, 8 bits of the OOK signal having a bit width Td are transmitted. The time length Ts in the leading part plays the role of activating the human body communication unit <b>114</b> of the portable terminal <b>100</b>. On the other hand, the OOK signal of time length Td&#xd7;n in the following part plays the role of switching the communication mode from the sleep mode to the normal mode. As described, in the case of the configuration where the OOK signal is added to the unmodulated carrier, probability of misoperation occurring due to external noise can be reduced compared to a case of transmitting only the unmodulated carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0096">On the other hand, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a signal configuration of a case where only the unmodulated carrier is transmitted over a specific period of time as the activation signal. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an unmodulated carrier having a time length Ts is transmitted. As described above, in the case of transmitting only the unmodulated carrier, susceptibility to the influence of the external noise will be high. However, an active/inactive period of the human body communication can be easily controlled by, for example, continuously transmitting the unmodulated carrier only while the human body communication is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0097">A relationship between a frequency spectrum of the human body communication in the normal mode and a frequency spectrum of the activation signal will be considered here with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. S<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the frequency spectrum of the human body communication in the normal mode. On the other hand, S<b>2</b> to S<b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> show the frequency spectra of the activation signal. Additionally, it is assumed that the human body communication in the normal mode is performed here using an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0098">In the case of using the activation signal only at the time of start of communication, the frequency spectrum of the activation signal may be set, like the frequency spectrum S<b>2</b>, in the same frequency band as the frequency spectrum S<b>1</b> of the human body communication. However, in the case of continuously transmitting the activation signal during communication in the normal mode, to avoid mutual interference, the frequency spectrum of the activation signal has to be set, like the frequency spectra S<b>3</b> and S<b>4</b>, in a band different from that of the frequency spectrum S<b>1</b> of the human body communication.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0099">(2-2-2: Details of Activation Signal Detection Unit <b>115</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0100">The configuration of the activation signal detection unit <b>115</b> included in the portable terminal <b>100</b> will be described here in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is an explanatory diagram for describing the configuration of the activation signal detection unit <b>115</b> included in the portable terminal <b>100</b> in greater detail.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0101">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the activation signal detection unit <b>115</b> is configured from a logarithmic amplifier <b>131</b>, a resistor <b>132</b>, a capacitor <b>133</b>, a comparator <b>134</b>, a determination unit <b>135</b>, and a timing generation unit <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0102">The activation signal detection unit <b>115</b> operates by a low-speed clock generated by the low-speed clock generator <b>117</b>. Furthermore, the activation signal detection unit <b>115</b> operates intermittently at a predetermined cycle. The operation timing of the activation signal detection unit <b>115</b> is controlled by an enable signal (Enable) generated by the timing generation unit <b>136</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the timing generation unit <b>136</b> emits an enable signal which will be on only during a time Ton (for example, 10 msec) and at a cycle Ti (for example, 1 sec).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0103">The enable signal generated by the timing generation unit <b>136</b> is input to the logarithmic amplifier <b>131</b>, the comparator <b>134</b>, and the determination unit <b>135</b>. With the activation signal detection unit <b>115</b> intermittently operating by the enable signal, the operating current can be greatly reduced. For example, when the Ti is 1 sec and the Ton is 10 msec, the operating current can be reduced to about 1/100 compared to a case of continuous operation. Additionally, when this configuration is implemented in a mobile phone or the like, the average power consumption in a wait state of structural elements other than the application unit <b>102</b> can be suppressed to about several tens of microwatts.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0104">Now, when an activation signal is input to the activation signal detection unit <b>115</b>, the input activation signal is input to the logarithmic amplifier <b>131</b>. When the activation signal is input, the logarithmic amplifier <b>131</b> amplifies the input activation signal. Then, the logarithmic amplifier <b>131</b> outputs a received signal strength indicator (RSSI), which is a log-linear DC voltage, according to the strength of the input activation signal. The RSSI output from the logarithmic amplifier <b>131</b> is smoothed by the resistor <b>132</b> and the capacitor <b>133</b>, and is input to the comparator <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0105">The comparator <b>134</b> has a predetermined threshold Vref input thereto, in addition to the smoothed RSSI. When the input RSSI exceeds the predetermined threshold Vref, the comparator <b>134</b> outputs a high signal. The high signal output from the comparator <b>134</b> is input to the determination unit <b>135</b>. In the case the activation signal detection unit <b>115</b> is operating in the time Ton where the enable signal is on and an unmodulated carrier of an activation signal is received, the determination unit <b>135</b> determines that an activation signal has been received.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0106">Furthermore, in the case the activation signal includes an OOK signal, the determination unit <b>135</b> asynchronously takes in the OOK signal following the unmodulated carrier, and determines the data. When the input signal is determined to be an activation signal as a result of determination by the determination unit <b>135</b>, the determination unit <b>135</b> inputs a WakeUp signal to the baseband unit <b>122</b>. On the other hand, when the activation signal is a signal only of the unmodulated carrier, the determination unit <b>135</b> inputs a WakeUp signal to the baseband unit <b>122</b> together with taking in the unmodulated carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0107">In the foregoing, the configuration of the activation signal detection unit <b>115</b> has been described in greater detail. As described above, the power consumption can be reduced by intermittently operating the activation signal detection unit <b>115</b>. Also, since operation is performed by a low-speed clock until an activation signal is received, the power consumption of the portable terminal <b>100</b> in a wait state can be greatly reduced. Also, since the communication mode of the portable terminal <b>100</b> is switched from the sleep mode to the normal mode using the human body communication, a user does not have to operate the portable terminal <b>100</b> at the time of switching the communication mode. As a result, a user does not have to take the portable terminal <b>100</b> out of the pocket or the like, and the convenience is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0108">In the foregoing, a functional configuration of the portable terminal <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment has been described. Additionally, a configuration of switching the communication mode (an operation mode using a high-speed clock, an operation mode using a low-speed clock) of the human body communication has been described above, but application to a configuration of switching the communication mode of other communication means such as the wireless LAN, the BT, and the like by using the human body communication is also possible. For example, modification into a configuration of switching, according to an activation signal transmitted by the human body communication, the sleep mode to the normal mode for means providing the wireless LAN is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0109">[2-3: Selection Method of Communication Means by Activation Signal]</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0110">Next, a selection method of communication means using an activation signal transmitted by the human body communication will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is an explanatory diagram for describing a selection method of communication means using an activation signal transmitted by the human body communication.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0111">As described above, the configurations of the portable terminal <b>100</b> and the information processing apparatus <b>200</b> can be modified into a configuration of switching the communication mode of the wireless LAN, the BT, or the like. However, if a plurality of communication means (for example, human body communication, wireless LAN, BT, infrared communication, and the like) are implemented in the portable terminal <b>100</b>, a mechanism for selecting communication means to be activated becomes necessary. Thus, the inventor of the present application has devised a mechanism for describing the type of communication means to be activated in an activation signal and transmitting the same. In the following, a process of selecting communication means and a process of activating the communication means of the portable terminal <b>100</b> and the information processing apparatus <b>200</b> adopting the mechanism will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0112">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, first, an activation signal is transmitted from the information processing apparatus <b>200</b> to the portable terminal <b>100</b> (S<b>101</b>). Here, it is assumed that the portable terminal <b>100</b> is in a wait state and predetermined communication means is in the sleep mode. It is also assumed that information indicating the predetermined communication means (hereinafter, activation type) as the communication means whose communication mode is to be switched from the sleep mode to the normal mode is described in the activation signal. The activation signal transmitted from the information processing apparatus <b>200</b> is received by the portable terminal <b>100</b> and is input to the activation signal detection unit <b>115</b> (S<b>102</b>). When the activation signal is input, the activation signal detection unit <b>115</b> reads the activation type described in the activation signal, and selects communication means to be activated based on the activation type (S<b>103</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0113">The activation signal detection unit <b>115</b> which has selected the communication means inputs a WakeUp signal to the selected communication means (S<b>104</b>). For example, the activation signal detection unit <b>115</b> inputs the WakeUp signal to a baseband unit of means providing the wireless LAN. The communication means to which the WakeUp signal has been input switches the communication mode from the sleep mode to the normal mode. As described, by having the activation type described in the activation signal, desired communication means can be activated also at the portable terminal <b>100</b> implemented with a plurality of communication means by using a switching method of communication mode that uses the human body communication.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0114">(Concrete Example of Wakeup Signal)</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0115">A supplementary explanation of a concrete configuration of the WakeUp signal used in a case of activating the wireless LAN by using the human body communication will be given here with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is an explanatory diagram for describing a concrete configuration of the WakeUp signal used in a case of activating the wireless LAN by using the human body communication.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0116">Normally, when the wireless LAN is activated on the side of the portable terminal <b>100</b>, the portable terminal <b>100</b> searches for an access point, existing in the vicinity, corresponding to a base station of the wireless LAN. For example, the portable terminal <b>100</b> scans all the channels and searches for a service set identifier (SSID) which is the ID of an access point to which the portable terminal <b>100</b> is to connect. When an access point having the target SSID is found, the portable terminal <b>100</b> connects to the access point.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0117">An encryption key for increasing the security is necessary at this point. A wired equivalent privacy (WEP) key or the like is used as this encryption key, for example. In the case of using the WEP, same information (key) is set in the transmission side and the reception side, and encryption/decryption is performed using this key. Additionally, in the case of the WEP, since the key is static (64-bit or 128-bit) and weak, a new scheme with increased security is also being devised.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0118">Now, for faster connection of the wireless LAN, a channel number (CH), the SSID, and the WEP key of the access point which is the connection target will be necessary. The WakeUp signal shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is configured from a preamble D<b>1</b> (PR), a unique word D<b>2</b> (UW), data D<b>3</b> (DATA), and a cyclic redundancy check code D<b>4</b> (CRC). Also, for faster connection of the wireless LAN, the data D<b>3</b> is configured from a channel number D<b>31</b>, an SSID D<b>32</b>, and a WEPKEY D<b>33</b>. Additionally, the data D<b>3</b> is error-checked by the cyclic redundancy check code D<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0119">The wireless LAN on the side of the portable terminal <b>100</b> receives the WakeUp signal (activation signal) illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, and connection is started in the case the WakeUp signal is determined to be correct. At this time, the portable terminal <b>100</b> starts connection to the access point by using the channel number, the SSID, and the WEPKEY included in the received WakeUp signal. As described, the channel number, the SSID, and the WEPKEY are given by the WakeUp signal, and thus connection by the wireless LAN between the access point and the portable terminal <b>100</b> is established in a short time.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0120">In the foregoing, an embodiment of the present invention has been described. As described above, by enabling switching of the communication mode of the portable terminal <b>100</b> by the information processing apparatus <b>200</b> by using the human body communication, desired communication means can be made usable without touching the portable terminal <b>100</b>. For example, a user can switch predetermined communication means to a valid state without taking the portable terminal <b>100</b> out of the pocket, bag, or the like and operating the same. As a result, the convenience of the user is greatly enhanced.</p>
