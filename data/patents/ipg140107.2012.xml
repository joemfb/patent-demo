<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention provides compositions, devices and methods for detecting esterase activity. The present invention also provides devices and methods of detecting esterase inhibitors, for example, organophosphates. In particular, the present invention provides a biosensor comprising Neuropathy Target Esterase (NTE) polypeptides. Further, the present invention relates to medicine, industrial chemistry, agriculture, and homeland security.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Widespread and long-term use of organophosphate (OP) compounds in industry and agriculture has made these hazardous compounds a part of environment, placing the health of human population at risk. This risk is the result of the capability of certain OP compounds to bind to and alter activity of Neuropathy Target Esterase (NTE), a membrane-bound esterase enzyme. Irreversible binding of OP compounds to NTE results in a debilitating neural disease known as (OP)-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN). Therefore, in addition to environmental exposure, compounds that inhibit esterase activity, and in particular NTE activity may be exploited in wars and by terrorists who might use compounds that cause OPIDN as chemical weapons against humans and animals.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, NTE has recently been implicated in well-known neurological diseases. Such diseases include motor-neuron diseases that occur spontaneously, without exposure to OP compounds, for example, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Because NTE plays a central role in both chemically induced and spontaneously occurring neurological diseases, there is a critical need for sensors with which to measure its esterase activity.</p>

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The term &#x201c;gene&#x201d; refers to a nucleic acid (e.g., DNA) sequence that comprises coding sequences necessary for the production of a polypeptide, RNA (e.g., including but not limited to, mRNA, tRNA and rRNA) or precursor (e.g., NTE). The polypeptide, RNA, or precursor can be encoded by a full length coding sequence or by any portion of the coding sequence so long as the desired activity or functional properties (e.g., enzymatic activity, ligand binding, signal transduction, etc.) of the full-length or fragment are retained. The term also encompasses the coding region of a structural gene and the sequences located adjacent to the coding region on both the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; ends for a distance of about 1 kb on either end such that the gene corresponds to the length of the full-length mRNA. The sequences that are located 5&#x2032; of the coding region and which are present on the mRNA are referred to as 5&#x2032; untranslated sequences. The sequences that are located 3&#x2032; or downstream of the coding region and that are present on the mRNA are referred to as 3&#x2032; untranslated sequences. The term &#x201c;gene&#x201d; encompasses both eDNA and genomic forms of a gene. A genomic form or clone of a gene contains the coding region interrupted with non-coding sequences termed &#x201c;introns&#x201d; or &#x201c;intervening regions&#x201d; or &#x201c;intervening sequences.&#x201d; Introns are segments of a gene that are transcribed into nuclear RNA (hnRNA); introns may contain regulatory elements such as enhancers. Introns are removed or &#x201c;spliced out&#x201d; from the nuclear or primary transcript; introns therefore are absent in the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript. The mRNA functions during translation to specify the sequence or order of amino acids in a nascent polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In particular, the term &#x201c;NTE gene&#x201d; or &#x201c;NTE genes&#x201d; refers to the full-length NTE nucleic acid sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NO:3). However, it is also intended that the term encompass fragments of the NTE sequences, mutants of the NTE sequences, as well as other domains within the full-length NTE nucleic acid sequences (e.g., SEQ ID NO:1). Furthermore, the term &#x201c;NTE nucleic acid sequence&#x201d; or &#x201c;NTE polynucleic acid sequence&#x201d; or &#x201c;NTE nucleotide sequence&#x201d; or &#x201c;NTE polynucleotide sequence&#x201d; encompasses DNA sequences, cDNA sequences, RNA (e.g., mRNA) sequences, and associated regulatory sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Where &#x201c;amino acid sequence&#x201d; is recited herein to refer to an amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring protein molecule, the term &#x201c;amino acid sequence&#x201d; and like terms, such as &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; or &#x201c;protein&#x201d; are not meant to limit the amino acid sequence to the complete, native amino acid sequence associated with the recited protein molecule and includes a portion or fragment thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In addition to containing introns, genomic forms of a gene may also include sequences located on both the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; end of the sequences that are present on the RNA transcript. These sequences are referred to as &#x201c;flanking&#x201d; sequences or regions (these flanking sequences are located 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; to the non-translated sequences present on the mRNA transcript). The 5&#x2032; flanking region may contain regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers that control or influence the transcription of the gene. The 3&#x2032; flanking region may contain sequences that direct the termination of transcription, post-transcriptional cleavage and polyadenylation.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;nucleic acid molecule encoding,&#x201d; &#x201c;DNA sequence encoding,&#x201d; and &#x201c;DNA encoding&#x201d; refer to the order or sequence of deoxyribonucleotides along a strand of deoxyribonucleic acid. The order of these deoxyribonucleotides determines the order of amino acids along the polypeptide (protein) chain. The DNA sequence thus codes for the amino acid sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">DNA molecules are said to have &#x201c;5&#x2032; ends&#x201d; and &#x201c;3&#x2032; ends&#x201d; because mononucleotides are reacted to make oligonucleotides or polynucleotides in a manner such that the 5&#x2032; phosphate of one mononucleotide pentose ring is attached to the 3&#x2032; oxygen of its neighbor in one direction via a phosphodiester linkage. Therefore, an end of an oligonucleotides or polynucleotide, referred to as the &#x201c;5&#x2032; end&#x201d; if its 5&#x2032; phosphate is not linked to the 3&#x2032; oxygen of a mononucleotide pentose ring and as the &#x201c;3&#x2032; end&#x201d; if its 3&#x2032; oxygen is not linked to a 5&#x2032; phosphate of a subsequent mononucleotide pentose ring.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">As used herein, a nucleic acid sequence, even if internal to a larger oligonucleotide or polynucleotide, also may be said to have 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; ends. In either a linear or circular DNA molecule, discrete elements are referred to as being &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; or 5&#x2032; of the &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; or 3&#x2032; elements. This terminology reflects the fact that transcription proceeds in a 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032; fashion along the DNA strand. The promoter and enhancer elements that direct transcription of a linked gene are generally located 5&#x2032; or upstream of the coding region. However, enhancer elements can exert their effect even when located 3&#x2032; of the promoter element and the coding region. Transcription termination and polyadenylation signals are located 3&#x2032; or downstream of the coding region.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;an oligonucleotide having a nucleotide sequence encoding a gene&#x201d; and &#x201c;polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence encoding a gene,&#x201d; mean a nucleic acid sequence comprising the coding region of a gene or, in other words, the nucleic acid sequence that encodes a gene product. The coding region may be present in a cDNA, genomic DNA, or RNA form. When present in a DNA form, the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide may be single-stranded (i.e., the sense strand) or double-stranded. Suitable control elements such as enhancers/promoters, splice junctions, polyadenylation signals, etc. may be placed in close proximity to the coding region of the gene if needed to permit proper initiation of transcription and/or correct processing of the primary RNA transcript. Alternatively, the coding region utilized in the expression vectors of the present invention may contain endogenous enhancers/promoters, splice junctions, intervening sequences, polyadenylation signals, etc. or a combination of both endogenous and exogenous control elements.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;complementary&#x201d; or &#x201c;complementarity&#x201d; are used in reference to polynucleotides (i.e., a sequence of nucleotides) related by the base-pairing rules. For example, for the sequence 5&#x2032;-A-G-T-3&#x2032;, is complementary to the sequence 3&#x2032;-T-C-A-5&#x2032;. Complementarity may be &#x201c;partial,&#x201d; in which some of the nucleic acids' bases are matched according to the base pairing rules. Or, there may be &#x201c;complete&#x201d; or &#x201c;total&#x201d; complementarity between the nucleic acids. The degree of complementarity between nucleic acid strands has significant effects on the efficiency and strength of hybridization between nucleic acid strands. This is of particular importance in amplification reactions, as well as detection methods that depend upon binding between nucleic acids. Complementarity can include the formation of base pairs between any type of nucleotides, including non-natural bases, modified bases, synthetic bases and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The term &#x201c;homology&#x201d; refers to a degree of complementarity. There may be partial homology or complete homology (i.e., identity). A partially complementary sequence is one that at least partially inhibits a completely complementary sequence from hybridizing to a target nucleic acid and is referred to using the functional term &#x201c;substantially homologous.&#x201d; The term &#x201c;inhibition of binding,&#x201d; when used in reference to nucleic acid binding, refers to inhibition of binding caused by competition of homologous sequences for binding to a target sequence. The inhibition of hybridization of the completely complementary sequence to the target sequence may be examined using a hybridization assay (Southern or Northern blot, solution hybridization and the like) under conditions of low stringency. A substantially homologous sequence or probe will compete for and inhibit the binding (i.e., the hybridization) of a completely homologous to a target under conditions of low stringency. This is not to say that conditions of low stringency are such that non-specific binding is permitted; low stringency conditions require that the binding of two sequences to one another be a specific (i.e., selective) interaction. The absence of non-specific binding may be tested by the use of a second target that lacks even a partial degree of complementarity (e.g., less than about 30% identity); in the absence of non-specific binding the probe will not hybridize to the second non-complementary target.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The art knows well that numerous equivalent conditions may be employed to comprise low stringency conditions; factors such as the length and nature (DNA, RNA, base composition) of the probe and nature of the target (DNA, RNA, base composition, present in solution or immobilized, etc.) and the concentration of the salts and other components (e.g., the presence or absence of formamide, dextran sulfate, polyethylene glycol) are considered and the hybridization solution may be varied to generate conditions of low stringency hybridization different from, but equivalent to, the above listed conditions. In addition, the art knows conditions that promote hybridization under conditions of high stringency (e.g., increasing the temperature of the hybridization and/or wash steps, the use of formamide in the hybridization solution, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">When used in reference to a double-stranded nucleic acid sequence such as a cDNA or genomic clone, the term &#x201c;substantially homologous&#x201d; refers to any probe that can hybridize to either or both strands of the double-stranded nucleic acid sequence under conditions of low stringency as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">A gene may produce multiple RNA species that are generated by differential splicing of the primary RNA transcript. cDNAs that are splice variants of the same gene will contain regions of sequence identity or complete homology (representing the presence of the same exon or portion of the same exon on both cDNAs) and regions of complete non-identity (for example, representing the presence of exon &#x201c;A&#x201d; on cDNA 1 wherein cDNA 2 contains exon &#x201c;B&#x201d; instead). Because the two cDNAs contain regions of sequence identity they will both hybridize to a probe derived from the entire gene or portions of the gene containing sequences found on both cDNAs; the two splice variants are therefore substantially homologous to such a probe and to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">When used in reference to a single-stranded nucleic acid sequence, the term &#x201c;substantially homologous&#x201d; refers to any probe that can hybridize (i.e., it is the complement of) the single-stranded nucleic acid sequence under conditions of low stringency as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As used herein, the term &#x201c;competes for binding&#x201d; is used in reference to a first polypeptide with an activity which binds to the same substrate as does a second polypeptide with an activity, where the second polypeptide is a variant of the first polypeptide or a related or dissimilar polypeptide. The efficiency (e.g., kinetics or thermodynamics) of binding by the first polypeptide may be the same as or greater than or less than the efficiency substrate binding by the second polypeptide. For example, the equilibrium binding constant (K<sub>D</sub>) for binding to the substrate may be different for the two polypeptides. The term &#x201c;K<sub>m</sub>&#x201d; as used herein refers to the Michaelis-Menton constant for an enzyme and is defined as the concentration of the specific substrate at which a given enzyme yields one-half its maximum velocity in an enzyme catalyzed reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The term &#x201c;fragment&#x201d; as used herein refers to a polypeptide that has an amino-terminal and/or carboxy-terminal deletion as compared to the native protein, but where the remaining amino acid sequence is identical to the corresponding positions in the amino acid sequence deduced from a full-length cDNA sequence. Fragments typically are at least 4 amino acids long, preferably at least 20 amino acids long, usually at least 50 amino acids long or longer, and span the portion of the polypeptide required for intermolecular binding of the compositions (claimed in the present invention) with its various ligands and/or substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The term &#x201c;polymorphic locus&#x201d; is a locus present in a population that shows variation between members of the population (i.e., the most common allele has a frequency of less than 0.95). In contrast, a &#x201c;monomorphic locus&#x201d; is a genetic locus at little or no variations seen between members of the population (generally taken to be a locus at which the most common allele exceeds a frequency of 0.95 in the gene pool of the population).</p>

In contrast, &#x201c;background template&#x201d; is used in reference to nucleic acid other than sample template that may or may not be present in a sample. Background template is most often inadvertent. It may be the result of carryover, or it may be due to the presence of nucleic acid contaminants sought to be purified away from the sample. For example, nucleic acids from organisms other than those to be detected may be present as background in a test sample.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As used herein, the term &#x201c;primer&#x201d; refers to an oligonucleotide, whether occurring naturally as in a purified restriction digest or produced synthetically, which is capable of acting as a point of initiation of synthesis when placed under conditions in which synthesis of a primer extension product which is complementary to a nucleic acid strand is induced, (for example, in the presence of nucleic acids and an inducing agent such as DNA polymerase and at a suitable temperature and pH). The primer is preferably single stranded for maximum efficiency in amplification, but may alternatively be double stranded. If double stranded, the primer is first treated to separate its strands before being used to prepare extension products. Preferably, the primer is an oligodeoxyribonucleotide. The primer must be sufficiently long to prime the synthesis of extension products in the presence of the inducing agent. The exact lengths of the primers will depend on many factors, including temperature, source of primer and the use of the method.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">As used herein, the term &#x201c;probe&#x201d; refers to an oligonucleotide (i.e., a sequence of nucleotides), whether occurring naturally as in a purified restriction digest or produced synthetically, recombinantly or by PCR amplification, that is capable of hybridizing to another oligonucleotide of interest.

The removal of contaminating proteins results in an increase in the percent of polypeptide of interest in the sample. In another example, recombinant polypeptides are expressed in plant, bacterial, yeast, or mammalian host cells and the polypeptides are purified by the removal of host cell proteins; the percent of recombinant polypeptides is thereby increased in the sample. For example, recombinant NEST polypeptides are expressed in bacterial host cells and the polypeptides are purified by the removal of host cell proteins; the percent of these recombinant polypeptides is thereby increased in the sample, see Examples.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">As used herein, &#x201c;substantially purified&#x201d; refers to molecules, either nucleic or amino acid sequences, that are removed from their natural environment, isolated or separated, and are at least 60% free, preferably 75% free, and most preferably 90% free from other components with which they are naturally associated.

Nucleic acid sequences necessary for expression in prokaryotes usually include a promoter, an operator (optional), and a ribosome binding site, often along with other sequences. Those vectors that include a prokaryotic replicon can also include a prokaryotic promoter region capable of directing the expression of a NTE or NEST gene in a host cell, such as <i>E. coli</i>.

<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The terms &#x201c;promoter element,&#x201d; &#x201c;promoter,&#x201d; or &#x201c;promoter sequence&#x201d; refer to a DNA sequence that is located at the 5&#x2032; end (i.e. precedes) of the coding region of a DNA polymer. The location of most promoters known in nature precedes the transcribed region. The promoter functions as a switch, activating the expression of a gene. If the gene is activated, it is said to be transcribed, or participating in transcription. Transcription involves the synthesis of mRNA from the gene. The promoter, therefore, serves as a transcriptional regulatory element and also provides a site for initiation of transcription of the gene into mRNA. Promoter sequences compatible with bacterial hosts are typically provided in plasmid vectors containing one or more convenient restriction sites for insertion of a contemplated DNA segment. Typical of such vector plasmids are pET21b vector (Novagen), pUC8, pUC9, and pBR329 available from Biorad Laboratories, (Richmond, Calif.) and pPL and pKK223-3 available from Pharmacia (Piscataway, N.J.).</p>

Promoter and enhancer elements have been isolated from a variety of eukaryotic sources including genes in yeast, insect, mammalian and plant cells. Promoter and enhancer elements have also been isolated from viruses and analogous control elements, such as promoters, are also found in prokaryotes. The selection of a particular promoter and enhancer depends on the cell type used to express the protein of interest. Some eukaryotic promoters and enhancers have a broad host range while others are functional in a limited subset of cell types (for review, see Voss, et al., Trends Biochem. Sci., 11:287, 1986; and Maniatis, et al., supra 1987, herein incorporated by reference).</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">The present invention provides compositions, devices and methods for detecting esterase activity. The present invention also provides devices and methods of detecting esterase inhibitors, for example, organophosphates. In particular, the present invention provides a biosensor comprising Neuropathy Target Esterase (NTE) polypeptides. Further, the present invention relates to medicine, industrial chemistry, agriculture, and homeland security.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Neuropathy Target Esterase (NTE) is an enzyme found in vivo as a membrane bound esterase. Alterations in NTE activity are associated with or implicated with motor neuron disease, for example, described below. Recently, mutations in NTE were linked with debilitating neurological diseases such as Lou Gehrig's disease. Rainier et al, &#x201c;Neuropathy target esterase gene mutations cause motor neuron disease,&#x201d; was presented at the 2005 American Society of Human Genetics meeting, Oct. 25-29, 2005 in Salt Lake City, Utah; and Rainier et al, (2008) Am J Hum Genet, 82:1-6; all of which are herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Neuropathy Target Esterase activity can also be altered by exposure to organophosphorus (OP) compounds. Binding of certain OP compounds to NTE is believed to cause (OP)-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN), a type of paralysis for which there is no effective treatment. Symptoms of OIPDN include paralysis of the lower limbs beginning one to three weeks after exposure to a neuropathic OP compound. Recovery from this disease is usually poor and there is no specific treatment. However, the capacity of OPs to inhibit NTE and cause OPIDP does not necessarily correlate with their capacity to inhibit acetylcholinesterase (Definition of Organophosphate (OPs) and Their Toxicology, Welcome to the Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD) website, 2006, on the world wide web at pesticides.gov.uk/approvals.asp?id=507).</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Acetylcholinesterase is naturally found in vivo in nerve tissue, red blood cells, and brain, while pseudocholinesterase is naturally found in vivo in plasma, liver and brain. In humans, anticholinesterase OPs have broadly similar actions to those seen in other species, as described in &#x201c;Definition of Organophosphate (OPs) and Their Toxicology,&#x201d; 2006, Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD), on the world wide web at pesticides.gov.uk/home.asp; herein incorporated by reference. For example, acetylcholinesterase inhibition causes acute effects in humans and other mammals. Symptoms in humans which generally occur when acetylcholinesterase activity has been reduced by about 50%, may include: headache, exhaustion and mental confusion together with blurred vision, sweating, salivation, chest tightness, muscle twitching and abdominal cramps. The severity of effects depends on the degree of acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Severe effects include muscle paralysis leading to severe difficulty in breathing thus requiring respiratory support of the patient, convulsions and unconsciousness. Recovery depends on elimination of the OP product from the body and return of acetylcholinesterase activity.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">On the other hand, anticholinesterase exposure is not always harmful. Indeed, anticholinesterases are used for beneficial purposes in anesthesia and in the treatment of human diseases such as myasthenia gravis, glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Thus compositions and methods for measuring NTE and NEST activity, in addition to other cholinesterases, are needed for disease research and for detecting NTE inhibitors. Further, these compositions and methods are also needed or determining the presence and effects of chemical and biowarfare agents that target NTE.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">The inventors provide as described herein, a nanostructured biosensor comprising esterase activity of NTE. An exemplary biosensor demonstrated a response time on the order of seconds and showed a dose-dependent decrease in sensor output in response to increasing concentrations of known NTE inhibitors. Potential applications of the biosensor include studying the fundamental reaction kinetics of NTE, screening OP compounds for effects on NTE activity, screening test samples for effects on NTE activity, screening environmental samples for effects on NTE activity, and investigating the effect of NTE mutations on NTE esterase activity.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">A general description of electrodes and biosensors for measuring esterase activity are provided below for comparing to the compositions and methods of the present inventions. In order to overcome previous limitations of devices and methods for measuring NTE activity, the present invention provides devices and methods for rapid and sensitive measurements of the esterase activity of NTE or fragments of NTE that contain its esterase domain (e.g., NEST). Further, the devices and methods of the present invention overcome previous limitations by providing rapid and sensitive measurements of the reduction of the esterase activity caused by inhibitory compounds of esterase activity.</p>

The first step is referred to as the enzyme's hydroxylase activity (also known as cresolase activity) where phenol is hydroxylated by the aid of molecular oxygen to produce catechol. In the second step, known as the catecholase activity, the enzyme oxidizes catechol to o-quinone and is simultaneously oxidized by oxygen to its original form, with the production of water. The reaction product, o-quinone, is electrochemically active and can be reduced back to the catechol form at low applied potentials, as illustrated in reaction (2).

<p id="p-0195" num="0194">These characteristics of tyrosinase were exploited by us to fabricate a NEST biosensor, capable of measuring the NEST's esterase activity and its inhibition, by co-immobilizing NEST and tyrosinase on a gold electrode using layer-by-layer assembly approach.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">I. Human NTE and NEST.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">The term &#x201c;Neuropathy target esterase&#x201d; or &#x201c;NTE&#x201d; refers to a membrane-bound esterase found in neurons of vertebrates (Glynn (1999) Biochemical Journal, 344:625-631; L1, et al., (2003) Journal of Biological Chemistry, 278:8820-8825; Atkins, et al., (2000) The Journal of Biological Chemistry, 275:24477-24483; Kropp, et al., (2004) Biochemistry, 43:3716-3722; Makhaeva, et al., (2003) Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health-Part A, 66:599-610; and van Tienhoven, et al., (2002) Journal of Biological Chemistry, 277:20942-20948; all of which are herein incorporated by reference). NTE was shown to be necessary for embryonic development in mice and believed to be involved in cell-signaling pathways and lipid trafficking (Glynn (1999) Biochemical Journal, 344:625-631). Further, NTE has serine esterase activity and hydrolyzes ester, peptide, and amide bonds.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Functionally, a nucleophilic serine residue (active site) of NTE attacks the carbonyl carbon atom of the substrate, forming a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate that is subsequently hydrolyzed. One consequence of this reaction mechanism is that the esterase activity of NTE was susceptible to covalent inhibition by organophosphorus esters (OPs) that causes formation of an analogous phosphyl-enzyme intermediate. Irreversible binding of some OP compounds to the active serine site results in a debilitating neural disease known as (OP)-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN) (Glynn (1999) Biochemical Journal, 344:625-631). Symptoms of OIPDN include flaccid paralysis of the lower limbs that becomes evident two to three weeks after exposure to neuropathic OPs. Recovery from this disease is usually poor, and there is no specific treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Expression of full-length human NTE is problematic. However a full-length human Neuropathy target esterase (NTE) and mutants thereof, were expressed in COS cells (European Collection of Cell Cultures, ECACC number 87021302; African green monkey kidney cells) (Li, et al., (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278 (10):8820-8825; herein incorporated by reference).</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Thus because NTE is difficult to produce for research purposes, research to study its esterase activity is typically done using a fragment of the NTE protein that contains the esterase activity domain polypeptide that is more easily produced than a full-length NTE. One such esterase activity domain polypeptide fragment is known as NEST (Atkins, et al. (2000), Journal of Biological Chemistry, 275:24477-24483; Kropp, et al. (2004) J. Biochemistry, 43:3716-3722; Forshaw, et al. (2001) Journal of Neurochemistry, 79:400-406; all of which are herein incorporated by reference) reacts with esters and inhibitors in a manner very similar to NTE.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Widespread and long-term use of OP compounds in industry and agriculture has resulted in a global distribution of these hazardous compounds throughout our environment posing a current health risk to humans and animals. Further, additional NTE poisons are present in our environment including neuropathic compounds from abandoned stockpiles, previous use of these compounds as chemical weapons, potential development and use as chemical weapons that pose additional health risks to animals and humans. Thus, in addition to its role in chemically induced sickness and death, NTE was also implicated in causing well-known motor-neuron diseases that don't require exposure to OP compounds. Recently, it was reported that gene mutations in NTE may lead to neurological disorders, for example, a mutation in an NTE gene linked to a disease phenotype was shown for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease (Richardson, &#x201c;Neuropathy target esterase gene mutations cause Motor neuron disease,&#x201d; presented at the 2005 American Society of Human Genetics meeting, Oct. 25-29, 2005, in Salt Lake City, Utah).</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Specifically, the present invention provides screening methods for identifying modulators, i.e., candidate or test compounds or agents (e.g., chemicals, proteins, peptides, peptidomimetics, peptoids, small molecules or other drugs) which bind to a NTE of the present invention, that have an inhibitory (or stimulatory) effect on, for example, NTE activity. Compounds thus identified can be used to modulate the activity of target gene products (e.g., NTE proteins) either directly or indirectly in a therapeutic protocol, to elaborate the biological function of the target gene product, or to identify compounds that disrupt normal target protein interactions. Compounds, that would stimulate the activity of a variant NTE or mimic the activity of a non-functional variant are contemplated as being particularly useful in the treatment of neurological disorders (e.g., Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) also called familial spastic paraparesis (FSP). In one embodiment, the invention provides assays for screening candidate or test compounds that are substrates of a NTE protein or NEST polypeptide or a biologically active portion thereof, or any esterase molecule of the present inventions. In another embodiment, the invention provides assays for screening candidate or test compounds that bind to or modulate the activity of a NTE protein or polypeptide or a biologically active portion thereof, or any esterase molecule of the present inventions.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Esterases and test compounds of the present invention can be obtained using any of the numerous approaches in combinatorial library methods known in the art, including biological libraries; peptoid libraries (libraries of molecules having the functionalities of peptides, but with a novel, non-peptide backbone, which are resistant to enzymatic degradation but which nevertheless remain bioactive; see, e.g., Zuckennann et al., (1994) J. Med. Chem. 37: 2678-85; herein incorporated by reference); spatially addressable parallel solid phase or solution phase libraries; synthetic library methods requiring deconvolution; the &#x2018;one-bead one-compound&#x2019; library method; and synthetic library methods using affinity chromatography selection. The biological library and peptoid library approaches are preferred for use with peptide libraries, while the other four approaches are applicable to peptide, non-peptide oligomer or small molecule libraries of compounds (Lam (1997) Anticancer Drug Des. 12:145; herein incorporated by reference).</p>

The fabrication and use of a biosensor/electrode for detecting a wide range of chemicals, such as organophosphate, wherein a set of enzymes or fusion proteins is immobilized (such as in a carbon-based matrix, a polymer based matrix, and the like) onto a substrate or surface of a chip or an isolated protein is added to a cross-linked gelatin, a conductive polymer, or a microcrystalline cellulose gel deposited on the surface of a platinum or palladium electrode, including a Clark electrode. For example, after purification of the biosensor polypeptides, such as an acetyl choline esterase, a polypeptide is added to a composite consisting of an immobilization matrix, buffer, necessary electrolytes, and a redox mediator such as an oxidoreductase enzyme EC 1.14.18.1 monophenol monooxygenase [tyrosinase] then the mixture can then be directly applied to an electrode surface and dried (for example, Intl.

The fast response of the ACh biosensor resulted in a considerable decrease of the real analysis time of the inhibitor, an organophosphorus type insecticide; trichlorfon. After each inhibition measurement cycle the biosensor was reactivated in pyridin-2-aldoxime methiodide for prolonged lifetime (for example, Gyurcs&#xe1;nyi, et al., (1999) Electroanalysis, 11 (10-11):712-718 [abstract]); herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">A biosensor chip was described with a first electrode and a second, of which at least one electrode is made from gold or coated with a gold layer of nanometer thickness, of which at least one electrode comprises an immobilized ligand, such as an enzyme, for example, tyrosinase or alkaline phosphatase, and a probe molecule and/or a holding area for holding ligands, such as enzymes. Further, the first electrode and the second electrode being designed in such a manner that a reduction/oxidation recycling operation can take place at these electrodes generating a current of which an electric current can be detected and can be differentiated according to time (for example, U.S. Patent Appln. No. 20040014054; herein incorporated by reference).</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">During the development of the present inventions, other types of enzymes, specifically oxidases and the like, comprising enzymatic activity capable of use in a recycling mechanism of the present inventions were contemplated. In particular, oxidases such as horse radish peroxidase and laccase enzymes for use with a substrate, such as phenyl valerate and the like, were contemplated.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">III. Measuring Neuropathy Target Esterase (NTE) and NEST Activity.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">Neuropathy Target Esterase plays a central role in both chemically induced and spontaneously occurring neurological diseases. Therefore, methods for measuring NTE activity and inhibitor substances are of tremendous scientific and commercial importance. Previous methods for measuring NTE esterase activity involved two separate steps wherein the first step provides a test solution comprising an esterase, such as NTE, while the second step comprising a measuring device, such as a tyrosinase electrode, wherein the tyrosinase electrode does not comprise an esterase, such as NTE.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">In the first step, at least two solutions are added together to form a test solution without an inhibitor solution or an additional test sample, wherein the first solution that contained a substrate, such as phenyl valerate, was brought into contact with a second solution comprising NEST or NTE protein. The NTE of the second solution may be a homogenate of tissue or purified NTE. For measuring esterase activity in a sample, a sample is added to the test solution, and further, when specific NTE inhibition was tested, an additional solution comprising an inhibitor was added to the test solution. Thus at least two solutions are added together for base-line sampling, wherein at least one solution comprises NTE for measuring NTE activity. Further, for environmental sampling, at least three solutions must be added together, wherein at least one solution comprises NTE. This method allowed the esterase enzyme in solution to react with the artificial substrate phenyl valerate to form phenol.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">In the second step, the concentration of phenol in the mixed test solution was determined using a detection device, either colormetrically using a spectrometer or electrochemically using an electrode. Colormetric detection was done in the presence of 4-amino antipyrine (Makhaeva, et al., 2003, Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health-Part A, 66:599-610); Kayyali, et al. (1991) Journal of Analytical Toxicology, 15:86-89; all of which are herein incorporated by reference), wherein the enzyme reaction was stopped, for example, by adding 2 mL of sodium dodecyl sulfate (1-2 percent W/V) in buffer containing 4-aminoantipyrine (otherwise known as 4-aminophenazone) (0.25 percent) followed by spectrometric absorbance measurements. Electrochemical measurements of activity were made in the presence of a tyrosinase enzyme (for example, Sigolaeva, et al. (2001) Analytical Biochemistry, 290:1-9; Sokolovskaya, et al. (2005) Biotechnology Letters, 27:1211-1218; all of which are herein incorporated by reference). When tyrosinase was used for electrochemical measurements, tyrosinase, attached to an electrode, wherein an esterase was not attached to the electrode, converted the phenol to catechol and then to an o-quinone that was measured electrochemically at the surface of an electrode (Makhaeva, et al. (2003) Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health-Part A, 66:599-610; herein incorporated by reference). The current generated by the electrode was in proportion to the amount of o-quinone present, thus giving an indirect measurement of the amount of NTE esterase activity present in the mixed test solution. For example, the current increased as the amount of o-quinone increased. When esterase inhibition was tested, this procedure was repeated both in the absence and presence of a known or putative inhibitor (e.g. an OP compound). The reduced signal that followed the addition of a known esterase inhibitor confirmed inhibition of esterase activity. This method has the disadvantages of being relatively slow by requiring the preparation and mixing of numerous test solutions subsequently followed by an electrochemical measurement of esterase activity. Further, these methods require a large supply of NTE in order to provide test solutions comprising NTE. These limitations render this method unsuitable for important applications, such as high throughput screening of compounds for NTE inhibition and continuous on-line environmental monitoring of samples in order to detect chemical warfare agents that target NTE.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">A. Examples of Electrodes for Measuring NTE Activity.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">The following publications are provided merely as examples of electrodes capable of measuring NTE activity. A biosensor and methods to analyze Neuropathy target esterase (NTE) and its inhibitors were described in Sigolaeva, et al., (1999), Chemico-Biologycal Interactions, 119-120:559-65; herein incorporated by reference. This method is based on the combination of NTE enzymatic hydrolysis of phenyl valerate (PV) with phenol detection by the Clark-type oxygen electrode modified by immobilized tyrosinase, wherein the NTE providing hydrolysis activity was free in solution. In a different publication, a tyrosinase carbon-paste electrode for amperometric detection of neuropathy target esterase (NTE) activity was used for measuring NTE activity in solution by catalytic hydrolysis of a substrate, phenyl valerate, also in solution, where the electrode operated in a flow-injection mode that required 2 to 3 minutes per analysis (Makhaeva, et al., 2003, J Toxicol Environ Health A, 66 (7):599-610; herein incorporated by reference).</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Methods are described for fabrication of a functional nanostructured biomimetic interface, comprising expressing recombinant cell membrane proteins, and further comprising embedding recombinant cell membrane proteins into biomimetic interfaces (Kohli, et al., Biomimetic Interfaces for Characterizing Membrane Proteins, November 4<sup>th</sup>, The 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Annual Meeting (Cincinnati, Ohio) Cincinnati, Ohio, Biomaterials (08b) #594-Biomimetic Interfaces (08B03) abstract 594b; herein incorporated by reference). Further described were application of these interfaces to study medically relevant membrane proteins such as Neuropathy Target Esterase (NTE) for high-throughput drug screening systems and novel biosensors.

No. 5,611,900 to Worden et al.; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">B. NTE Biosensors of the Present Invention.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">In the present invention, unlike the previous electrodes and sensors, a nanostructured biosensor interface is provided that comprises NTE enzymatic activity. However, production of full-length NTE protein for research purposes has been reported as being inefficient and uneconomical. Thus, the majority of published research on NTE activity involves using a fragment of the NTE protein that comprises NTE enzymatic activity that can be more efficiently produced. One such fragment, known as NEST, reacts with esters and inhibitors in a manner very similar to NTE. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a nanostructured biosensor comprising the NTE catalytic domain NEST.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">In some embodiments, the biosensor is fabricated by co-immobilizing NEST protein and tyrosinase enzyme on an electrode using layer by layer assembly approach by Decher (Decher (1997) Science 5330:1232-1237; all of which are herein incorporated by reference). Surprisingly, this is the first time NEST has been immobilized in an active conformation on an electrode. The biosensor of the present invention is the first continuous, electrochemical biosensor for real-time, rapid measurement of NEST (or NTE) esterase activity. Thus, in one embodiment, the enzymatic activity of NTE is provided by a NEST protein attached to an amperometric electrode. In other embodiments, the enzymatic activity of NTE is provided by a NEST protein attached to a tyrosinase electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">In some embodiments, the present invention provides biosensors comprising full-length NTE. In some embodiments, the biosensors of the present invention are used for measuring NEST esterase activity using full-length NTE in place of NEST.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">Thus, in some embodiments, biosensors comprising NTE are immersed in solutions comprising phenyl valerate for measuring enzymatic activity. In some embodiments, a self-contained NTE biosensor of the present invention is able to both rapidly measure NTE activity and simultaneously enable recording the loss of such activity in the presence of a known NTE inhibitor PMSF.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">In some embodiments, the invention provides an exemplary biosensor formed by using a layer-by-layer assembly approach for immobilizing a layer of NEST protein molecules on top of previously applied layers of a polyelectrolyte, poly-L-lysine, and a tyrosinase protein enzyme. This biosensor demonstrated a response time on the order of seconds and showed a dose-dependent decrease in sensor output in response to known NTE or NEST inhibitors. Applications of the biosensor include, but are not limited to, studying the fundamental reaction kinetics of NTE mutants, screening OP compounds for NTE inhibition, and investigating the effect of NTE mutations on NTE esterase activity.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">In some embodiments, biosensors of the present invention are assembled using a nanostructured tyrosinase electrode. In some embodiments, the biosensors of the present invention further incorporate electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), potential step voltammetry and ellipsometry for developing biosensors of the present inventions.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">Applications of the biosensors of the present invention include, but are not limited to, detecting the presence of chemical weapons that target NTE, screening industrial and agricultural OP compounds for NTE inhibition, studying the fundamental reaction kinetics of NTE, and investigating the effect of NTE mutations found in ALS patients on NTE's enzymatic properties.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods comprising the following steps for measuring NTE activity using a biosensor of the present invention: (1) functional NTE reacts (hydrolyzes) phenyl valerate to form phenol, (2) the tyrosinase reacts with (oxidizes) phenol to from catechol and then tyrosinase further catalyzes the formation of o-quinone in a manner proportional to the amount of catechol, (3) the remaining elements of the electrode on which the interface is immobilized reacts (reduces) o-quinone back to catechol, wherein this last step is contemplated as the recycling and amplification step, and (4) an electrical current generated by the electrode in the presence of and proportional to the amount of o-quinone. It is further contemplated that the reductions in step (3) provides a continuous signal that increases in response to an increase in NTE esterase activity.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">C. Esterase Biosensors of the Present Invention.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">The methods of the present invention are also adaptable for providing additional types of esterase biosensors. Specifically, in some embodiments, the substrates and methods described herein are used to immobilize and measure the activity of other esterases such as acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. In some preferred embodiments, a phenyl valerate substrate provides the highest level of NEST and butyrylcholinesterase sensitivity for measuring esterase activity. In other embodiments, phenyl acetate showed the highest sensitivity in combination with acetylcholinesterase esterase activity.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">The compositions and methods described herein for the NTE biosensor can also be extended to measure the activity of other medically relevant esterases such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). AChE, also known as Red Blood Cell (RBC) cholinesterase or erythrocyte cholinesterase was found primarily in the blood and neural synapses (Davis, et al. (1997) Anaesthesia 52:244-260; Herz, et al. (1973) Pediatric Research 1973, 7:204-214; Hsieh, et al. (2001) J. Neurotoxicology 2001, 22:423-427; and Lejus, et al. (1998) Annales Francaises D Anesthesie Et De Reanimation, 17:1122-1135; all of which are herein incorporated by reference). BChE, also known as plasma cholinesterase or pseudocholinesterase, was found primarily in the liver (Lejus, et al. (1998) Annales Francaises D Anesthesie Et De Reanimation, 17:1122-1135; Darvesh, et al. (2003) Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 4:131-138; all of which are herein incorporated by reference). Both of these enzymes hydrolyze the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid, a reaction necessary to allow a cholinergic neuron to return to its resting state after activation, but they differ in their respective preferences for substrates. The former hydrolyzes acetylcholine more quickly and the latter hydrolyzes butyrylcholine more quickly. Cholinesterase inhibitors are potent neurotoxins or biological warfare agents against humans because exposure to them may cause any one of excessive salivation and eye watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death. Commonly known acetylcholinesterase inhibitors include are snake venom and sarin.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">D. Significance of NEST Biosensor:</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">The compositions and methods of the present inventions offer several advantages over previously known sensors and electrodes for measuring esterase activity. The first advantage of using electrodes of the present invention comprising NTE enzymes, is the reduction of the number of steps required for measuring NTE activity to one step, consisting of immersing the biosensor interface comprising an esterase into a test solution containing a substrate, such as phenyl valerate, rather than a two step method of adding a substance comprising esterase to a substrate in solution and then immersing a tyrosinase electrode into a solution of both esterase and substrate. Because the NTE esterase activity is co-immobilized with tyrosinase on the sensor interface rather than in solution where it is not attached to the tyrosinase electrode, the presence of phenyl valerate triggered a cascade of reactions that resulted in an electrical signal. Second, the electrodes comprise nanometer-scale thickness of enzyme layers on the sensing interface of the electrode, which provides for a very short diffusion path that provides a more rapid response time that in total was less than 10 seconds. Third, the biosensor is useful for continuous, real-time measurements of NTE esterase activity due to the rapid response time. Fourth, the biosensor is designed to achieve signal amplification, thus increasing the sensitivity of the sensor. The inventors contemplate that the signal amplification arose from a recycle mechanism that allowed catechol and o-quinone to accumulate at the biosensor interface. Because the biosensor's signal increased with increased o-quinone concentration, this recycling mechanism results in a higher signal for a given amount of NTE activity than achieved without recycling capabilities. Fifth, mathematical models have been developed for this biosensor that facilitate optimization of the biosensor's performance characteristics. Sixth, the biosensor' interface is generated by flexible, layer-by-layer, molecular self-assembly methods that allowed for adding improvements predicted by theoretical mathematical models (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-15</figref>) that were rapidly reduced to practice and verified in experimental systems such as those described herein. For example, the spatial orientations and proportions of the two enzymes could be readily controlled to optimize biosensor response. Seventh, the molecular self-assembly methods allow the biosensor interface to be assembled on electrodes inside microfluidic channels, thus enabling the production of high-density biosensor arrays for high-throughput applications.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">Finally, the inventors contemplated further increasing the sensitivity of their electrode by increasing the flow of fluid comprising substrate over the electrode surface. Two methods of increasing fluid flow are 1) mounting the electrode on a rotating disk to rotate the electrode in the fluid in other words a &#x201c;rotating disk electrode&#x201d; wherein a &#x201c;rotating disk electrode&#x201d; also refers to an electrode capable of being mechanically rotated and 2) accelerating fluid flow over the electrode surface by using jets of fluid or other means of moving fluid. Thus in some embodiments, the inventors provided biosensors comprising rotating disk electrodes in place of nonrotating electrodes, also referred to as &#x201c;stationary electrodes.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">Thus, biosensors of the present invention provide devices with unique advantages over previously described sensors. In summary, compositions and methods for measuring of esterase activity utilize a solution comprising of an esterase substrate for triggering an electrical signal, esterase enzymes and thus their activity were co-immobilized with tyrosinase on the sensor interface rather than provided in solution. Further advantages are provided by biosensor interfaces comprising organic layers on the order of nanometer-scale thickness in the sensing interface thus providing a short diffusion path that allowed a rapid response time (less than 10 seconds) and continuous real-time measurements of esterase activity when contacted with an esterase substrate. Biosensors of the present invention further demonstrate signal amplification thus providing high sensitivity of esterase activity. Furthermore, because the biosensor interface is generated by flexible layer-by-layer molecular self-assembly methods the inventors contemplate assembling these electrodes inside microfluidic channels, thus enabling the production of high-density biosensor arrays consisting of various esterases for high-throughput applications.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">These combinations of desirable properties makes this esterase interface well suited for important and necessary applications, including studying the kinetic properties of esterases such as NTE (or NEST) protein, high-throughput screening of NTE compounds (or NEST) for inhibition and continuous, on-line, environmental monitoring to detect chemical warfare agents that target NEST (or NTE) and other esterases.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">IV. NTE and Susceptibility to Organophosphate Toxicity.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">Individuals with altered NTE expression may have increased or decreased susceptibility to organophosphate toxicity. As an example, both chemically and genetically induced NTE deficiency, for example, a decrease in NTE, a decrease in NTE activity by inhibiting NTE with the compound ethyl octylphosphonofluoridate (EOPF), caused increased sensitivity to organophosphate toxicity and increased resulting neurotoxic symptoms such as motor activity (see, Winrow et al., (2003) 33 (4) Nature Genetics 477-485; herein incorporated by reference).</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">Therefore, the present invention provides methods for screening individuals for susceptibility to organophosphate toxicity. In some embodiments, the methods comprise screening an individual for increased susceptibility to organophosphate toxicity. In some embodiments, the methods comprise screening an individual subject for susceptibility to organophosphate toxicity comprising functional and genetic testing of the subject's NTE. In one embodiment, the methods comprise screening an individual subject for exposure to an organophosphate. In one embodiment, the methods comprise screening an individual subject for exposure to a neurotoxic compound. In preferred embodiments, the subject's NTE is tested functionally using devices and methods of the present inventions. In other embodiments, a subject's NTE is screened by a combination of functional and genetic testing of the individual's NTE.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">The present invention further provides compositions and methods for studying kinetic properties of NTE activity, high-throughput screening of compounds for NTE inhibition, and continuous on-line environmental monitoring in order to detect chemical warfare agents that target NTE.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">In some embodiments, the present invention provides biosensors for studying the kinetic properties of the NTE esterase activity, high-throughput screening of compounds for NTE inhibition, and continuous, on-line, environmental monitoring to detect chemical warfare agents that target NTE. In some embodiments, the biosensors are used for detection of NTE, inhibitors and neuropathic compounds that age NTE and thereby cause OPIDN, improving signal-to-noise ratio and sensitivity, demonstrating that the sensor works for full-length NTE, and assembling biosensor analysis for high-throughput measurements of multiple samples.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">V. Methods of Identifying Individuals at Risk for Developing Motor Neuron Disorders.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">NTE is an integral membrane protein present in the majority of neurons and in some non-neural-cell types of vertebrates, such as red blood cells. NTE is involved in a cell-signaling pathway controlling interactions between neurons and accessory glial cells in the developing nervous system. NTE has serine esterase activity in vivo and efficiently catalyses the hydrolysis of phenyl valerate (PV) in vitro. By sequence analysis NTE is related neither to the major serine esterase family, which included acetylcholinesterase, nor to any other known serine hydrolases. NTE comprises at least two functional domains: an N-terminal putative regulatory domain and a C-terminal effector domain which contains the esterase activity and is, in part, conserved in proteins found in bacteria, yeast, nematodes and insects. NTE's effector domain contains three predicted transmembrane segments, with the active-site serine residue at the center of one of these segments. The isolated recombinant domain shows PV hydrolase activity when incorporated into phospholipid liposomes.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">In preferred embodiments, the present invention provides a method of diagnosing motor neuron disorders comprising a subject's NTE enzyme.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">In other embodiments, the present invention provides a method genetic sequencing of a subject's NTE gene sequence. In other embodiments, the present invention provides a method of diagnosing motor neuron disorders through enzymatic testing of a subject's NTE enzyme. In other preferred embodiments, the risk of developing a motor neuron disorder may be ascertained through genetic testing of a subject's NTE gene sequence. In some embodiments, the risk of developing a motor neuron disorder may be ascertained through enzymatic testing of a subject's NTE enzyme.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">There are numerous motor neuron disorders that may be linked to alterations in esterase activity. Thus, subjects with motor neuron disorders would benefit from methods comprising biosensors of the present inventions for measuring NTE esterase activity. For example, motor neuron disorders, such as delayed neuropathy, as found in patients with swelling of lower limbs or paralysis; motor neuron diseases, as found in patients with neurological disorders where motor neurons are destroyed as in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Lou Gehrig's disease, wherein muscle weakness is progressive and eventually fatal; are contemplated as subjects who would benefit and inhibition are of scientific importance. Subjects with motor neuron disorders such as those listed below, would benefit from methods comprising biosensors of the present inventions including but not limited to amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease), autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia, hereditary spastic paraplegia, primary lateral sclerosis, progressive pseudobulbar palsy, progressive muscular atrophy, progressive bulbar palsy, and postpolio syndrome.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">Symptoms characteristic for a specific type of motor neuron disorder vary according to the part of the nervous system most affected by the disease. Moreover motor neuron disorders typically involve progressive deterioration of the motor nerves in the spinal cord or brain, causing muscle weakness that can progress to paralysis. Clinical aspects of motor neuron disorders involve debilitating symptoms commonly resulting in death. Clinical features of these disorders that would signal diagnostic concerns include detecting onset by signs of progressive motor neuron involvement. However, nerve conduction velocities for many of these disorders appear normal until later in the progression of disease. Electromyography is the most useful test, showing fibrillations, positive waves, fasciculations, and giant motor units, even in unaffected limbs, however such tests are not useful for predicting genetic or somatic susceptibility. Thus methods of identifying individuals at risk for developing motor neuron disorders, especially prior to onset of disease symptoms, are needed and my be met by compositions and methods comprising biosensors of the present inventions described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">In summary, biosensors were developed for continuous measurements of NEST activity. The biosensors were fabricated by layer-by-layer assembly approach to co-immobilize NEST and tyrosinase on a gold electrode for providing real-time measurements of esterase activity. Ellipsometry and EIS provided evidence for the sequential assembly of the multiple layers that make up the interface. Constant potential voltammetry allowed NEST enzyme activity to be measured with a rapid response time (&#x3c;10 s). The biosensor gave dose-dependent response to known non-neuropathic (PMSF) and neuropathic (Mipafox) NEST inhibitors. The same interface can also be used to immobilize and measure the activity of other medically relevant esterases such as acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">Further, a theoretical method for bi-enzyme electrodes, capable of rotation, with substrate recycling was developed for use in designing electrodes with increased sensitivity for a set concentration of esterase, in particular a NTE. The method was validated by studying the response of bi-enzyme rotating disk electrode consisting of two enzymes, NEST and tyrosinase, to phenyl valerate, phenol and catechol under varying rotating speeds. The validated model assisted in determining and quantifying the influence of important parameters such as mass transport in the bulk and enzyme layer, partition coefficients, enzyme kinetics and catechol recycling on the sensitivity of the sensor. This information is contemplated for use in optimizing the metrological characteristics of bi-enzyme electrodes. As a result of using this method for achieving even higher signal amplification, the inventors contemplate further methods for increasing a oxidase (for example, tyrosinase, laccase, horse radish peroxidase an the like, for loading tyrosinase loading on the electrode surface interface. Also contemplated is using these types of interfaces as a sensor for detecting NEST inhibitors such as organophosphorous compounds.</p>

<p id="p-0253" num="0252">The <i>E. coli </i>BL21(DE3) pLysS strain and pET21b vector were purchased from Novagen. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was purchased from QIAGEN Inc. Polymerase chain reactions were carried out using Pfu polymerase and the NTE cDNA clone D16 as a template (see, Atkins, et al. (2000), Journal of Biological Chemistry, 275:24477-24483; herein incorporated by reference). Polymerase chain reaction products corresponding to amino acids 727-1216 and 733-1216 were subcloned into the pET21b vector where DNA sequences were verified to be present using DNA sequencing methods well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">NEST Expression and Purification:</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">NEST was expressed in and purified from <i>E. coli </i>according to published procedures, briefly described herein (Atkins, et al. (2000), Journal of Biological Chemistry, 275:24477-24483; herein incorporated by reference). Briefly, a DNA fragment encoding NEST (for example, SEQ ID NO: 1, see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>.) was cloned into a pET-21b vector and the resulting expression vector was transformed into <i>E. coli </i>BL21(DE3). An overnight culture of transformed <i>E. coli </i>was inoculated with M9 media containing ampicillin and grown in a fermentor device. IPTG was added to the resulting cell culture after a day to induce the expression of NEST. The resulting cells were collected 4 h after induction by centrifugation and subjected to protein expression techniques. Briefly, 5 g of cell paste was suspended in 30 ml of PEN buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate/0.3 M NaCl/0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.8) containing 2% CHAPS and tip sonicated four times. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 30 min at 4&#xb0; C., the supernatant was collected, and about 7 mL of supernatant was added to a mini column (volume 10 mL) containing 3 mL of Ni-NTA resin. The mini-column was rotated at room temperature for 20 min, centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 sec and then the top solution was drawn off. The histidine tagged NEST was eluted from the Ni-NTA resin using 10 mL of PEN buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mM EDTA) containing 0.3% CHAPS and 0.3 M imidazole. Protein purity was determined using SDS PAGE (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) and protein concentration was determined using BioRad DC protein assay kit. For long-term storage, 25% glycerol was added to the protein solution, which was then stored at &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. Detergent was used both for solubilization of NEST from lysates of <i>E. coli </i>and during purification procedures. If catalytic activity of purified NEST was lost in detergent extracts, it was restored when purified NEST was incorporated into dioleoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">Preparation of Phenyl Valerate Solution:</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">15 mg of phenyl valerate was dissolved in 1 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF), and 15 mL of water containing 0.03% Triton was added slowly under vigorous stirring. For potential step voltammetry experiments, small aliquots of the resulting phenyl valerate micellar solution (5.286 mM) were added to a phosphate buffer to obtain the desired concentrations.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">Preparation of Piranha Solution:</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">Piranha cleaning solution, also referred to as piranha etch, was a hot mixture of sulphuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), used to clean organic residue off of substrates such as the base electrodes of the present inventions prior to the layering of the biosensor components. Piranha solution is a 3:1 concentrated sulphuric acid to hydrogen peroxide solution (such as a 30% hydrogen peroxide stock solution). Alternatively, other concentrations of acids can be used, such as a 4:1 up to a 7:1 mixture of concentrated sulphuric acid to hydrogen peroxide solution, including a closely related mixture, referred to as &#x201c;base piranha&#x201d; that is a 3:1 mixture of ammonium hydroxide (NH<sub>4</sub>OH) with hydrogen peroxide. A dipping bath was made with sulphuric acid, to which was added the peroxide solution. The electrodes were slowly immersed into the solution and cleaned from 10 to 40 minutes, after which time the electrode was removed from the solution and rinsed with a large amount of deionized water.</p>

In order to assemble an exemplary NEST biosensor, gold electrodes were cleaned in Piranha solution, as described, supra, then electrodes were dipped in 5 mM solution of thioctic acid in ethanol for 30 minutes. The electrodes were washed with ethanol, dried under nitrogen and dipped in PLL solution for 45 minutes. The electrodes were then rinsed with water and dipped in an aqueous solution of Tyrosinase (0.2 mg/ml) for 1 hour. The last two steps were repeated 3.5 times to create 3.5 PLL-Tyr bilayers with PLL as the topmost layer. The electrodes were washed with water and dipped in a solution of NEST protein (0.1 mg/ml) in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH (7.0) for 1 hour. The electrodes were then washed with water, dried under nitrogen and dipped in phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.0) for testing.</p>

<p id="p-0265" num="0264">Acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase were immobilized on separate tyrosinase electrodes by the same procedure used for assembling the NEST biosensor described herein, with the exception that the NEST solution was replaced by a solution of either acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, such that the final dipping was done in 0.1 mg/mL phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) of acetylcholinesterase or butyrylcholinesterase.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS):</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results were obtained using a CHI 660B electrochemical analyzer (CH instruments, Austin, Tex.) for obtaining measurements of the thickness of each layer formed after dipping the gold working electrode in [Fe(CN)6]3&#x2212;/4&#x2212; (1:1), 1 mM, in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The impedance spectrum was obtained by sweeping an applied potential of 10 mV from 0.1 Hz to 104 Hz, superimposed on a DC offset equivalent to open circuit potential. The impedance spectra were fitted using Z-view software (Version 2.1b, Scribner Associates, Southern Pines, N.C.). See, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">Ellipsometry:</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">Ellipsometric measurements were obtained with rotating analyzer ellipsometer (model M-44; J.A. Woollan Co. Inc., Lincoln, Nebr.) using WVASE32 software. The thickness values for dried films were determined using 44 wavelengths between 414.0 nm and 736.1 nanometers. The angle of incidence was 75&#xb0; for all experiments. Refractive indices of films containing PLL and proteins was estimated to be constant values of n=1.5 and k=0. These optical constants compared well with those values determined by ellipsometry for actual 4 bilayer films of poly-L-lysine and tyrosinase without an esterase. See, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">Potential Step Voltammetry and Other Measurements:</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">The electrodes (sensors) were maintained at a potential of &#x2212;100 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode) using a BAS CV-50W electrochemical analyzer. The esterase activity of NEST biosensor was monitored by measuring the output current for a variety of phenyl valerate concentrations, under conditions of stirred solutions. The NEST protein converts phenyl valerate to phenol, which gets converted to o-quinone by tyrosinase. The o-quinone gets reduced at the electrode's surface, resulting in the generation of current. The electroreduction of o-quinone produces catechol that again gets converted to o-quinone by tyrosinase, thus amplifying the signal. See, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">Esterase activity was measured using a known quantity of phenyl valerate added to the phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), under stirred conditions. After the stabilization of current, a known amount of NEST inhibitor was added, and the resulting decrease in current was measured.</p>

<p id="p-0274" num="0273">Moreover, based on the preliminary date described below, the inventor's believe this is the first demonstration of heterologous expression of a full-length, fully active NTE protein. In order to obtain this full-length functional protein, cDNA for the full-length human NTE was subcloned into plasmid pTrcHis2/TOPO (Invitrogen) to yield plasmid pTrcHis2/hNTE, which was then transformed into an <i>E. coli </i>Rosetta (DE3) expression host. The cells were grown on LB medium in shake flask to an OD600 of 1.0, and NTE expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. The resulting Western blot (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) shows a band consistent with full-length NTE expression.</p>

<p id="p-0277" num="0276">Preparation of Gold Electrode for NEST Biosensor.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">The inventors produced electrodes comprising human NTE and tyrosinase. The following procedure was used to make prototype biosensors of the present inventions that have the molecular architecture shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 4B</figref>. For example, gold electrodes (3 cm&#xd7;1 cm) were cleaned in Piranha solution, dried, and then dipped in 5 mM solution of thioctic acid for 30 minutes. The electrodes were then washed with ethanol, dried under nitrogen and dipped in PLL solution in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.75) for 45 minutes. The electrodes were then rinsed with water and dipped in an aqueous solution of tyrosinase (0.2 mg/ml) for 1 hour. The last two steps of soaking and rinsing in PLL and tyrosinase were repeated 3.5 times to create 3.5 PLL-Tyr bilayers with PLL as the topmost layer. These tyrosinase electrodes were then washed with water and dipped in a solution of NEST protein (0.1 mg/ml) in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH (7.0) for 1 hour (a schematic of tyrosinase binding to a substrate is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). The NEST electrodes (as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) were then washed with water, dried under nitrogen, and dipped in phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.0) for testing described herein. This electrode rapidly (within seconds) detected the presence of an NTE inhibitor added to the substrate solution. In one embodiment, organophosphates were detected via the interruption of electrical current generated by the general reactions described in brief below. Some advantages of using electrodes of the present inventions include ability for economical production of these electrodes in combination with rapid time response (within several seconds) with increased sensitivity over electrodes described in publications.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">In the presence of certain substrates, such as phenyl valerate, functional NTE hydrolyzes phenyl valerate yielding an amount of phenol proportional to the functional activity of NTE. Tyrosinase then converts phenol to o-quionone, see, schematic in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. O-quionone then generates an electric current, in the presence of electron conducting materials, in proportion to its concentration that is in direct proportion to the initial phenol concentration.</p>

<p id="p-0280" num="0279">Ellipsometry and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) Measurements</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">Ellipsometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to confirm the deposition of different layers that make up the NEST biosensor. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the thickness increase following the addition of first PLL and Tyr bilayer was approximately 9.3&#xb1;0.4 nm. Thickness increased for each of the next two PLL-Tyr bilayers at the same amount and equal to approximately 7.2&#xb1;0.3 nm. The thickness further increased following the addition of final PLL-NEST bilayer of approximately 6.6&#xb1;0.3 nm. EIS measurements in the presence of the negatively charged redox couple [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]3&#x2212;/4&#x2212;, were made on the gold electrode to probe the electrical properties of resulting films and provide further evidence of biosensor interface assembly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> shows the Nyquist plots obtained on a bare gold electrode following the successive addition of the following layers: thioctic acid (curve a), PLL-Tyr first bilayer (curve b), PLL-Tyr second bilayer (curve c), PLL-Tyr third bilayer (curve d), and PLL and NEST final bilayer (curve e). Nyquist plots were fitted with Randles equivalent circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. This circuit produced a semicircle at higher frequencies and a straight line at low frequencies. The semicircle at higher frequencies is related to the parallel combination of double-layer capacitance (Cdl) and charge transfer resistance (Rct). For this system, the Rct value was approximately equal to the diameter of the semicircle. At lower frequencies, a straight line results, at angle of 45&#xb0; to the x-axis, that is related to the Warburg-diffusion impedance (Zw). In other words, at high frequencies (short time scales), the impedance is controlled by electron-transfer kinetics, and at low frequencies (long time scales), the impedance is diffusion-controlled. The Rct value is thought to be controlled by the thickness of the multilayered polymer assembly.&#x201d; (Harris, et al. (2000) Langmuir, 16:2006-2013; Pardo-Yissar, et al. (2001) Langmuir, 17:1110-1118; all of which are herein incorporated by reference). The Randles equivalent circuit model was fitted to impedance plots to obtain the values of different parameters such as Rct, Cdl, Zw, and solution resistance, Rs. The average best-fit values of Ret are shown in Table 1.1. As expected, the Rct (which is also approximately equal to the diameter of the semicircle domain in the impedance spectra plotted as a Nyquist diagram), increased upon the successive addition of layers, due to increasing barriers for electron exchange between the conductive support and solubilized redox probe.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">In summary, a phenyl valerate substrate demonstrated the highest current sensitivity for bi-enzyme electrodes consisting of the enzymes Tyrosinase and NEST, and for bi-enzyme electrodes containing tyrosinase and butyrylcholinesterase. In contrast, phenyl acetate demonstrated the highest sensitivity for bi-enzyme electrodes containing tyrosinase and acetylcholinesterase.</p>

An exemplary circuit diagram of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.

<p id="p-0286" num="0285">The various experimental parameters (such as pH and applied potential), which can affect the amperometric determination of phenyl valerate, were optimized. The effect of applied potential on the amperometric response of the sensor was tested in the range between 0.05 and &#x2212;0.20 V (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows the steady state response of the biosensor both in the presence and absence (background current) of phenyl valerate.

The highest signal-to background (noise) ratio was obtained at &#x2212;0.1 V. At working potential more negative then &#x2212;0.1 V, higher signals were obtained, but the background current also distinctly increased.

The response time of the electrode was less then 20 s, and further, a well-defined step increase in current indicated a response time less than 10 seconds. The bionsensor's rapid response was contemplated due to the nano-scale thickness of the biosensor interface. An exemplary well-defined reduction current, proportional to the amount of phenyl valerate, was observed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>).

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8F and 8G</figref>, there was no decrease on the addition of 10 &#x3bc;M PMSF, a 20% (&#xb1;3%) decrease in response to the addition of 100 &#x3bc;M PMSF, see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8H and 8I</figref>, and a 70% (&#xb1;4%) decrease on the addition of 1000 &#x3bc;M PMSF, see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8J and 8K</figref>. PMSF inhibition of NEST esterase activity reduced the amount of phenol and subsequently o-quinone produced. Therefore, less o-quinone was reduced at the electrode surface resulting in a lowered current. The inventors observed a similar dose-dependent drop in current after a neuropathic OP compound, MIPAFOX (50 mM mipafox), was added to the phosphate buffer. These results demonstrated that a NEST biosensor of the present inventions were used for dose dependent detection of NEST inhibitors.</p>

<p id="p-0297" num="0296">The following example demonstrates storage stability of the biosensors for at least one month. The storage stability of the sensors provided using methods described herein, were tested by storing at 4&#xb0; C. in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The electrode was used at least once a day for over 30 days to obtain measurements of a current response to a chosen concentration of phenyl valerate standard solution. The results showed that the activity of sensor remained stable for a month and then reduced gradually, with a half-life of 12 days.</p>

<p id="p-0298" num="0297">Immobilization of Acetylcholinesterase and Butyrylcholinesterase.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">During the course of providing a biosensor of the present inventions, the inventors used the same PLL-Tyr multilayer interface to immobilize and measure the activity of other esterases such as acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase in place of NEST. A typical current-time response, for a bi-enzyme electrode consisting of tyrosinase and acetylcholinesterase, after the successive addition of aliquots of 8 &#x3bc;M phenyl acetate to the phosphate buffer is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. A response to phenyl acetate was found to be linear (r=0.989) in the range 0.5 &#x3bc;M to 16 &#x3bc;M. The response reached saturation at approximately 40 &#x3bc;M. However, no significant rise in current was observed when phenyl valerate instead of phenyl acetate was used as a substrate on this interface. These results demonstrated that phenyl acetate provides a better substrate for acetylcholinesterase than phenyl valerate. Current time response curves were also obtained with a bi-enzyme electrode consisting of tyrosinase and butyrylcholinesterase, with the highest current sensitivity being obtained when phenyl valerate was used as a substrate (results similar to exemplary <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). Table 1-2 summarizes the current sensitivities obtained with three different bi-enzyme interfaces. Control experiments were done in which each of the substrates was exposed to a gold electrode containing PLL-Tyr bilayers without an esterase layer. The current sensitivities obtained in these control experiments were always less than 0.5 nA&#x3bc;M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>. Collectively, these interfaces were used for simultaneously detecting the presence of a variety of compounds that inhibit cholinesterases in addition to studying kinetics of cholinesterase reactions.</p>

<p id="p-0300" num="0299">Experimental Results Obtained from Mathematical Models of Biosensor Function.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">Mathematical models demonstrating mass transfer and reactions at the biosensor interface of an NTE esterase electrode were developed for use in the present inventions. These models were used to elucidate the fundamental nanoscale phenomena that govern performance of the biosensors of the present inventions. These models comprised mass balance equations for each of phenyl valerate, phenol, catechol, and o-quinone, see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-15</figref>. These mathematical models developed and used during the development of the present inventions predicted a five-fold signal amplification via recycling in the prototype NTE esterase biosensor.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">Analytical solutions to these equations were charted which demonstrated the concentration profiles of phenyl valerate, phenol, catechol, and quinone as a function of relative position (x/L) within the biosensor interface, as well as current density as a function of phenyl valerate bulk concentration, as a Sherwood number and Thiele modulus. Example concentration profiles for catechol, quinone, and phenol based on reasonable values of parameters are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, normalized to the bulk concentration of the phenyl valerate substrate. The current produced by the reporting interface as a function of amount of NTE esterase loading (&#x3b8;1) and amount of tyrosinase loading (&#x3b8;3) is predicted by the model (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11B and 11C</figref>), allowing the model to assist the inventors in optimizing operational characteristics of the interface. Thus the inventors designed biosensors of the present inventions to achieve greater signal amplification for dramatically increased sensitivity of the biosensor. Amplification was achieved by electrochemically recycling the enzymatic reaction product (quinone) back to the intermediate (catechol) for re-use as a tyrosinase substrate.</p>

<p id="p-0304" num="0303">This example presents a theoretical model for an actual bi-enzyme rotating disk electrode consisting of NEST and tyrosinase as described in Example III. The molecular architecture of the bi-enzyme electrode is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In this model, as in the previous Examples demonstrating stationary electrodes, a NEST protein converts phenyl valerate to phenol, which is converted to o-quinone by tyrosinase. The o-quinone is electrochemically reduced to catechol at the electrode's surface, resulting in current. A portion of the catechol produced is then converted to o-quinone by tyrosinase. Catechol thus serves as shuttle analyte that can undergo successive cycles of enzymatic oxidation-electrochemical reduction (substrate recycling), resulting in an amplification of biosensor's response.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">This theoretical model further comprises the influence of the mass transport, permeation through the enzyme layers and enzyme kinetics. This model is expressed in dimensionless form to minimize the number of constants that must be evaluated. The biosensor was assembled on a rotating disk electrode, and the biosensor's performance was measured at a variety of rotational velocities and substrate concentrations to evaluate the constants and validate the model.</p>

<p id="p-0307" num="0306">Tyrosinase is a binuclear copper containing enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of catechols to o-quinone (catecholase activity).

<p id="p-0309" num="0308">In contrast, the experiments conducted in the course of developing the present inventions involve substrate concentrations around two orders of magnitude less than K<sub>m</sub><sup>app</sup>. Thus kinetics were contemplated herein to be first order relative to the substrate concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">Besides of its catecholase activity, tyrosinase is also able to catalyze orthohydroxylation (monophenolase activity) of monophenols to o-diphenols (catechols) that, in turn, are oxidized to corresponding o-quinones (catecholase activity). Because the hydroxylation activity of tyrosinase is expressed in conjunction with oxidation of o-diphenol to its o-quinone, some authors have defined monophenolase activity as the complete conversion of monophenols to o-quinone. Indeed, the hydroxylation step proceeds and has been shown to be much slower than the oxidation of o-diphenol to o-quinone and is therefore considered to be the rate limiting (Coche-Guerente, Labbe et al. 2001; herein incorporated by reference). The enzymatic oxidation of phenol to o-quinone has also been shown to follow Michaelis-Menten formalism (Coche-Guerente, Labbe et al. 2001; herein incorporated by reference), with an apparent K<sub>m</sub><sup>app </sup>of &#x2dc;250 &#x3bc;M in homogeneous solution.</p>

(2) Partitioning of S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>, S<sub>3 </sub>and Q<sub>4 </sub>from the stagnant film into the enzyme layer. The kinetics of partitioning were assumed to be rapid so that the interfacial concentrations in the film and enzyme layers remained at equilibrium.

where S<sub>1</sub>(&#x221e;) denotes the bulk phenyl valerate concentration. This equation demonstrates that the bio-electrode response is affected by the rate of mass transport in the stagnant film (m<sub>e</sub>) and the enzyme layer (P<sub>m</sub>), as well as by the enzymatic activities toward phenyl valerate (&#x3b8;<sub>1</sub>), phenol (&#x3b8;<sub>2</sub>) and catechol (&#x3b8;<sub>3</sub>). Equation 1.27 was derived assuming that only phenyl valerate is present in the bulk. However, if only phenol is present in the bulk, then it has been shown that the following relation can be (Coche-Guerente, Labbe et al. 2001; herein incorporated by reference):

where S<sub>ct</sub><sup>c </sup>denotes the sensitivity of the electrode in the presence of catechol at an applied potential of &#x2212;0.1 V (where major contribution to current comes from the reduction of o-quinone), and S<sub>ct</sub><sup>a </sup>denotes the sensitivity at an applied potential of 0.5 V (where major contribution to current comes from oxidation of catechol which couldn't be converted to o-quinone by tyrosinase). For rotating disk electrodes we can assume m<sub>e </sub>to be given by the following Levich equation (Coche-Guerente, et al. 1999; herein incorporated by reference):

<p id="p-0339" num="0338">Preparation of a Rotating Gold Electrode for Use with the Present Inventions:</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0339">The molecular architecture of the biosensor is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. Gold rotating disk electrodes (electrodes capable of being mechanically rotated) (Metrohm Limited, Herisau, Switzerland) were polished with alumina powder and dipped in 5 mM solution of thioctic acid in ethanol for 30 min. The electrodes were washed with ethanol, dried under nitrogen and dipped in PLL solution for 45 min. The PLL solution was prepared by adding 12 mg of poly-lysine in 50 ml of 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.5). The electrodes were then rinsed with water and dipped in equimolar solution of tyrosinase and NEST in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for 45 min. The last two steps were repeated 3 times to create 3 bilayers of PLL and tyrosinase/NEST. The electrodes were then washed with water, dried under nitrogen and dipped in phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.0) for testing. These experiments were done at room temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0340">Chronoamperometry and Other Measurements for Rotating NEST Biosensors of the Present Inventions:</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0341">The bi-enzyme rotating disk electrodes containing NEST and tyrosinase were maintained at a potential of &#x2212;100 mV (vs Ag/AgCl reference electrode) using a CHI 660B electrochemical analyzer (CH instruments, Austin, Tex.). Electrochemical measurements were performed a bi-enzyme rotating disk electrode (area=0.07 cm<sup>2</sup>) dipped in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), into which small aliquots of phenyl valerate, phenol or catechol solution were added. The steady state current was then measured at different rotating speeds. Ellipsometric measurements were done using a WVASE 32 (J.A. Woollam Co. Inc., Lincoln, Nebr.) ellipsometer. The angle of incidence was 75&#xb0; for these experiments. The refractive indices of films were estimated to be n=1.5, k=0.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0342">Validation of the Model.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">The model was validated using NEST and tyrosinase containing bi-enzyme electrodes. Four electrodes (A, B, C and D) were used, and the steady state cathodic and anodic current sensitivities S<sub>ct</sub><sup>c </sup>and S<sub>ct</sub><sup>a</sup>, were measured at two different catechol concentrations (3 and 5 &#x3bc;M), under varying electrode rotation speeds. Similarly the cathodic current sensitivities, S<sub>ph</sub><sup>c </sup>and S<sub>pv</sub><sup>c</sup>, were also measured at different phenol (3 and 5 &#x3bc;M) and phenyl valerate concentrations (3 and 5 &#x3bc;M). While, the cathodic sensitivity, S<sub>ct</sub><sup>c</sup>, remained practically constant with rotation rate, S<sub>ph</sub><sup>c </sup>and S<sub>pv</sub><sup>c</sup>, decreased with rotation rate.</p>

Both plots, as predicted by the model (equations 1.32 and 1.33), showed linearity with correlation coefficients (R<sup>2</sup>) greater than 0.98, suggesting that the model reasonably represent the electro-enzymatic processes occurring in the presence of catechol. From the slopes and intercepts of the fitted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>, Equations 1.32 and 1.33 can be used to determine &#x3b8;<sub>3</sub>=1.81 (&#xb1;0.2), P<sub>m</sub>=0.0091 (&#xb1;0.0015) cm/s and D<sub>e</sub>=2.2 (&#xb1;1.2&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>) cm<sup>2</sup>/s. Alternatively, D<sub>e </sub>can also be determined separately using Levich plot on a bare gold electrode. The obtained value of D<sub>e </sub>compares well with published values of D<sub>e </sub>for catechol (Coche-Guerente, et al. 1999; herein incorporated by reference).

Although these calculations are approximate, they lead to the suggestion that the diffusion in the enzyme film is approximately 3 orders of magnitude slower than in bulk electrolyte. Similar effects were reported in layered polyelectrolyte films (Coche-Guerente, et al. 2001; herein incorporated by reference). In further theoretical computations, immobilized tyrosinase showed the same kinetic constants as in the homogeneous solution, where concentrations [E<sub>2</sub>] and [E<sub>3</sub>] of monophenolase and catecholase active sites were determined using the following relations:

<p id="p-0357" num="0356">The model's predictions help explain the observed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> (D)) decrease in current with increasing rotation rates in the presence of phenyl valerate. The electrochemical transduction step regenerates catechol from o-quinone. A portion of the catechol is lost by diffusion through the stagnant film, and the remainder is oxidized to o-quinone, which increases the sensor's output. As the electrode rotation rate increases, the film mass transfer coefficient also increases and increasing fraction of the catechol is lost. As a consequence, less catechol is recycled to o-quinone, and the o-quinone concentration at the electrode is reduced, leading to lower sensitivity for phenyl valerate detection. Consistent with this mechanism, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17(C)</figref> shows that the predicted concentration gradient of o-quinone at x=0 decreases as the rotation rate increases.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0357"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> (D) shows the simulated current sensitivity, S<sub>pv</sub><sup>c</sup>, as a function of amount of NEST esterase activity (&#x3b8;<sub>1</sub>) and tyrosinase's catecholase activity (&#x3b8;<sub>3</sub>), assuming P<sub>m</sub>=0.0091 cm/s and &#x3c9;=500 rpm. At low &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>values, S<sub>pv</sub><sup>c </sup>increases as &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>increases, indicating that the NEST activity is rate limiting. However, as &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>increases, the S<sub>pv</sub><sup>c </sup>curve approaches an asymptote, indicating that the biosensor response is becoming limited by the catechol recycling (&#x3b8;<sub>3</sub>). For a given, &#x3b8;<sub>1</sub>, the current sensitivity S<sub>pv</sub><sup>c </sup>increases with &#x3b8;<sub>3</sub>, because at higher values of catecholase activity enzymatic recycling of o-quinone becomes more and more efficient, leading to amplified responses or higher sensitivities.</p>

<p id="p-0363" num="0362"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows predicted AF values as a function of &#x3b8;<sub>3</sub>, assuming experimentally realistic values of P<sub>m</sub>=0.0091 cm/s and &#x3c9;=500 rpm. Amplification increases with &#x3b8;<sub>3 </sub>and, depending upon the rotation rate, amplification factors as high as 20 can be achieved. The mathematical model predicts about 2.5-fold signal amplification via recycling for our bi-enzyme electrode at a rotation speed of 500 rpm.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0363">Collectively, the results of the experiments described herein present methods for optimization of bi-enzyme biosensors that involve substrate recycling, such as those provided in the present inventions. The results show strategies and methods for increasing biosensor sensitivity. When these methods were applied to NEST biosensors of the present inventions, a demonstration was provided for increasing the tyrosinase concentration while decreasing the mass transfer coefficient gave higher electrical signals (signal amplification) for a given NEST loading on the electrode. This result is particularly important to electrodes of the present inventions since tyrosinase is relatively inexpensive and commercially available, while NEST is not commercially available. Further NEST/NTE expression and purification requires special expertise.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0364">All publications and patents mentioned in the above specification are herein incorporated by reference. Various modifications and variations of the described compositions and methods of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Although the invention has been described in connection with specific preferred embodiments, it should be understood that the invention should not be unduly limited to such specific embodiments. Indeed, various modifications of the described modes for carrying out the invention which are obvious to those skilled in chemistry, medicine, diagnostics, molecular biology or related fields are intended to be within the scope of the present invention and the following Claims.</p>
