<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Large scale, multi-story buildings are typically constructed of steel and concrete. Floors in such buildings may be composite floor systems assembled by spanning wide flange beams with spaced-apart steel joists and installing typically corrugated metal decking over the joists. The decking forms a lateral surface onto which a cementitious slab can be placed and cured. Generally, the underside of the beams or lower chords of the joists form the framework from which ceilings may be supported. The composite floor construction is typically achieved by using welded shear studs, or partial extension of the joist upper chord, extending above the form or metal deck into the cementitious slab. Flooring system designs must also be mindful of fire safety, acoustics, and vibration considerations.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such composite floor systems have been designed in the past to address one or more of these issues individually. These prior designs have included some systems that integrated the joist and deck assembly with the cementitious slab to provide a composite floor system. This integral structure was assembled by providing self-drilling studs with a threaded portion to be in threaded engagement with the deck and underlying joists. A length of each stud extended above the metal decking and was encased in the cementitious slab, and resisted and transmitted horizontal shear forces which develop between the cementitious slab and the supporting joist structure. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,605,423. These composite floor systems were an improvement, but still had drawbacks in that the floor systems were time consuming and difficult to install. There was still a need for a composite floor system that was rapidly and safely installed with fewer building errors to provide a floor system with improved erectability and economy for the same or greater load bearing capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Disclosed is an improved composite joist floor system comprising a first support structure, a second support structure, a plurality of joists spaced apart and extending from the first support structure to the second support structure, decking supported by the plurality of joists, and a plurality of stand-off fasteners adapted to be fastened through the decking to the plurality of joists, each stand-off fastener of carbon steel comprising a lower portion and an upper portion where the lower portion has a clamping part capable of clamping the decking to the joist, the lower portion having a threaded portion adjacent the clamping part with a through hardness of between HRB 70 and HRC 40 and having the lower portion of the fastener with a failure torque to thread-forming torque of at least 3.0 and a drive torque at least 20% less than a thread-forming torque, a thread-forming portion adjacent the threaded portion of at least HRC 50 hardness adapted to enable the fastener to form threads in an upper chord of a joist, and a fluted lead portion adjacent the thread-forming portion of at least HRC 50 hardness with a nominal diameter between 80 and 95% of major diameter of the threaded portion adapted to form a fastener opening in an upper chord of a joist, and the upper portion of the stand-off fasteners have a through hardness of between HRB 70 and HRC 40 and when installed, at least a portion of the upper portion of each stand-off fastener extends significantly above the decking. The composite floor system is completed by providing a cementitious slab supported by the decking and encapsulating the upper portion of each stand-off fastener extending above the decking. The threaded portion of the fastener may extend to within 1.5 of a thread pitch of the clamping part of the fastener.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The threaded portion of each stand-off fastener may meet a specification selected from the group consisting of ASTM A307, ASTM A325, ASTM A354, and ASTM A490 specification or a specification selected from the group consisting of SAE J429 Grade 2, SAE J429 Grade 5, and SAE J429 Grade 8.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The stand-off fasteners of the composite joist floor system may have a drive torque no more than 50% of a thread-forming torque. In any case, the lower drive torque enables the fasteners to be rapidly installed through the deck and into a joist upper chord with low consumption by battery powered tools with a worker in a short time, with the thread forming torque in forming the threads in the deck and joist following drilling of the fastener opening and the seating torque desired for the fastener being the controlling torques in positioning the fastener. This low power consumption and labor saving installation is enabled by the nominal diameter fluted lead portion of the fastener adapted to form a fastener opening in an upper chord of a joist between 80 and 95% of major diameter of the threaded portion or between 80 and 98% of major diameter of the threaded portion. Additionally, the failure torque of the fastener is more than three (3) times the thread-forming torque and may be more than four (4) times the thread-forming torque so that the prospect of the fastener failing and lessening the load capability of the composite floor system is avoided. The thread-forming torque of each stand-off fastener may be no more than 100 inch-pounds.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The failure torque is substantially more than the seating torque of the fastener. The threaded portion of each stand-off fastener may have a seating torque of at least 80 inch-pounds, or between 80 and 450 inch-pounds to provide the proper seating torque, depending on the size of the stand-off fastener and type and properties of the decking, joist and other support material into which the stand-off fasteners are threaded. The threaded portion of each stand-off fastener may also have a thread angle of less than 50&#xb0;, or may have a thread angle between 45 and 60&#xb0; Alternately or in addition, the threaded portion may include back-tapered threads for ease of installation. The back-taper of the threaded portion may be between 0.0005 and 0.0025 inch per inch of length or between 0.001 and 0.003 inch per inch of length.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The thread-forming portion of each stand-off fastener may be between 3 and 7 thread pitches in length to provide desired thread-forming torque. To further improve the speed of assembly and improve the load carrying capacity of the composite floor the shape of the thread-forming portion of the stand-off fastener may be selected from the group consisting of bilobular, trilobular, quadlobular and pentalobular. Of these the quadlobular shape has been found to date to give the best performance in thread forming. In any event, these lobar shapes of the thread-forming portion of the fastener control the thread-forming torque and drive torque to facilitate assembly of the composite floor system and reduce failures in installation of the stand-off fasteners and improve the load carrying capacity of the assembled composite floor system.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, the fluted lead portion of the stand-off fastener may have a milled point to reduce the failure rate of the stand-off fastener. Pinch point may be provided on the fluted lead portion of the stand-off fastener, but we have found the fasteners made with a milled point are more reliable and result in less failures of the stand-off fastener, reducing assembly time and cost and producing an assembled composite floor assembly with greater load capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another aspect of the present composite floor system is the threaded portion of the fastener has a through hardness of between HRB 70 and HRC 40, while the fluted lead portion and most if not all of the thread-forming portion has a hardness of at least HRC 50. Such through hardness on the threaded portion of the fastener enables the composite floor system to support higher loads as the fastener interacts with the cementitious slab and avoids cracking and fracturing of the fastener. The threaded portion of each stand-off fastener may be of at least HRC 33 through hardness and up to five threads adjacent the thread-forming portion may be hardened to at least HRC 50 hardness. To further facilitate assembly of the composite floor system, the fluted lead portion may be of at least HRC 54 hardness or of at least HRC 50 induction hardness. The upper portion of the stand-off fasteners have a through hardness of between HRB 70 and HRC 40 to provide ductility in the upper portion of the fastener to reduce cracking in the fasteners in operation in a cementitious slab of the composite joist floor system.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, the clamping portion of the lower portion of each stand-off fastener of composite joist floor system may comprise a fastener drive head positioned to be used in installing the stand-off fastener and the upper portion of the stand-off fastener is sized to permit the stand-off fastener to be installed into the decking. A SEMS anchor or stake anchor may be positioned on the upper portion of the stand-off fastener sized to permit the stand-off fastener to be installed into the decking and a joist upper chord and the SEMS anchor or stake anchor engage in the cementitious slab on installing of the fastener and placement of the cementitious slab. Optionally, the stand-off fastener may include threads adjacent the end of upper portion of the fastener configured to couple to a reinforcing member such as rebar or some other member that will effectively extend the length of the stand-off fastener. These embodiments further improve the composite floor system by further reducing failures in positioning the fasteners, and at the same time reducing the time to assemble the floor system. Stand-off fasteners utilizing the SEMS anchor or stake anchor also are easy to produce and improve the load carrying capacity of the composite floor system at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The decking may comprise corrugated steel decking defining altering peaks and valleys, where the stand-off fasteners are installed in the valleys of the corrugated steel decking, and where adjacent stand-off fasteners along a joist are separated by at least one valley of the corrugated steel decking. Alternatively or in addition, the decking may comprise corrugated steel decking defining altering peaks and valleys, and at least two adjacent stand-off fasteners are located in the same valley of the corrugated steel decking.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Also disclosed is a wall panel system comprising a metal base adapted to support placement of a cementitious material, a plurality of stand-off fasteners for fastening at spaced locations along the base, each stand-off fastener of carbon steel comprising a lower portion and an upper portion where the lower portion has a threaded portion, a thread-forming portion adjacent the threaded portion adapted to enable the fastener to form threads in the base, and a fluted lead portion adjacent the thread-forming portion with a nominal diameter between 70 and 95% of major diameter of the threaded portion adapted to form a fastener opening in the base, and where, when installed, at least a portion of the upper portion of each stand-off fastener extends significantly above the base; and a cementitious slab formed on the base and encapsulating the upper portion of each stand-off fastener extending above the base to form a desired wall surface of the panel system.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The lower portion of the fasteners of wall panel system may have a threaded portion with a through hardness of between HRB 70 and HRC 40 and the lower portion of the fastener has failure torque to thread-forming torque of at least 3.0 and a drive torque at least 20% less than a thread-forming torque. The stand-off fastener may have a drive torque no more than 50% of a thread-forming torque. In addition, the thread-forming portion adjacent the threaded portion of a wall panel system has at least HRC 50 hardness adapted to enable the fastener to form threads in the base, and a fluted lead portion adjacent the thread-forming portion of at least HRC 50 hardness. The threaded portion of each stand-off fastener may be of at least HRC 33 through hardness and up to five threads adjacent the thread-forming portion may be hardened to at least HRC 50 hardness. The fluted lead portion may have at least HRC 54 hardness. The upper portion of the stand-off fasteners have a through hardness of between HRB 70 and HRC 40 to provide ductility in the upper portion of the fastener to reduce cracking in the fasteners in operation in a cementitious slab of the wall panel system.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">These wall panel systems are typically assembled with the lower portion of the stand-off fasteners drilled and threaded into the metal base. The base may comprise corrugated metal decking assembled and fastened to wall studs. In any case, temporary or permanent side walls may surround the metal base and support the concrete during placing and curing of the cementitious slab. The wall may extend above the upper portion of the stand-off fasteners so the surface of the cementitious slab provides a desired wall surface for the panel system without upper portions of the fasteners showing through. In this way a composite wall panel can be assembled that can be lifted into place. The wall panel system has the metal base, cementitious slab and stand-off fasteners as an integral wall system that can provide a desired wall surface where cracking of the cementitious slab is inhibited if not eliminated. The wall panel system may be used either as an inside wall system or an outside wall system as explained in more detail below with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">To facilitate assembly and avoid assembly defects, the clamping portion of the lower portion of each stand-off fastener may comprise a fastener drive head positioned to be used in installing the stand-off fastener, with the upper portion of the stand-off fastener sized to permit the stand-off fastener to be installed into the base. An SEMS anchor or stake anchor may be positioned on the upper portion of the stand-off fastener sized to permit the stand-off fastener to be fastened into the base, with the SEMS anchor or stake anchor (threaded or unthreaded) engaging in the cementitious slab on installing of the fastener and placement of the cementitious slab. These embodiments provide for easier installation, while improving the quality and integrity of composite wall panel system assembled.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Alternatively, a fastener drive head may be positioned on the upper portion of each stand-off fastener adapted to be used in fastening the stand-off fastener to the base and to engage in the cementitious slab on installing of the fastener and placement of the cementitious slab. In this embodiment, SEMS anchor is part of the lower portion of each stand-off fastener and adapted to engage the base and the cementitious slab on placement of the cementitious slab.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">To facilitate assembly of the wall panels, the thread-forming portion of each stand-off fastener has a shape selected from the group consisting of bilobular, trilobular, quadlobular and pentalobular.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">For the wall panel systems, the threaded portion of each stand-off fastener may meet a specification selected from the group consisting of ASTM A307, ASTM A325, ASTM A354, and ASTM A490 specification or a specification selected from the group consisting of SAE J429 Grade 2, SAE J429 Grade 5, and SAE J429 Grade 8.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As with the composite floor systems, the fluted lead portion of the stand-off fastener may have a milled point to reduce the failure rate of the stand-off fastener. Pinch point may be provided on the fluted lead portion of the stand-off fastener, but as previously observed, we have found the fasteners made with a milled point are more reliable and result in less failures of the stand-off fastener, reducing assembly time and cost and producing an assembled composite floor assembly with greater load capacity</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Embodiments of the present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all, embodiments of the invention are shown. The invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Composite Joist Floor Systems</heading>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The composite joist floor systems described herein are generally assembled at the building site and provide structural support for floors and/or ceilings of the building. In general, pluralities of steel joists are positioned laterally spaced apart supported at either end by the building's primary support structures. Such building support structures may include but are not limited to: I-beams and H-beams, joist girders, masonry walls, concrete walls, cold-formed wall studs, and/or wood load bearing wall studs. In any case, the steel joists span the open areas within the building's main structure to provide support for the floors or ceilings, or both. Importantly, the present invention provides a plurality of varying component floor system designs and design approaches. These various designs may use a combination of joist depth, chord size, joist spacing, flexible stand-off fastener size and spacing, and various corrugated steel deck profiles to create flooring systems that are light in weight, have generally decreased material costs, labor costs, and construction costs, assembled largely without construction errors, and offer improved strength and load bearing capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Typical steel joists of the composite joist floor systems described herein have spans ranging from eight (8) to fifty (50) feet and depths ranging from eight (8) to fifty (50) inches. In addition to variations in the size and spacing of the joist, the number and pattern of the stand-off fasteners, the configuration of the corrugated steel decking, the connections between the flooring system and the support beam, as well as other design elements contribute to lighter weight, materially reduced construction errors, and added strength and load bearing capacity for the composite floor system.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate a partial perspective view, with portions broken-away, and a partial cross-sectional side view, respectively, of a composite joist floor system <b>100</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, and as described above, the composite joist floor system <b>100</b> generally includes a plurality of laterally, spaced apart joists <b>110</b> supported on their ends by a supporting wall or beam, such as a wall structure <b>101</b> comprising steel wall studs as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The joist <b>110</b>, in combination with other joists, walls, or beams (not shown); supports a cementitious slab <b>120</b> on corrugated steel decking <b>180</b>. The corrugated steel decking <b>180</b> is typically, but not necessarily positioned such that the corrugations run substantially perpendicular to the joist <b>110</b>. Importantly, a plurality of stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> are drilled through the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b> into the upper chord of joist <b>110</b>. The lower portion of each stand-off fastener <b>130</b> connects the corrugated decking <b>180</b> to the joist <b>110</b>, and the upper portion of each stand-off fastener <b>130</b> extends some distance above the corrugated decking <b>180</b>. In this way, when cementitious material is placed over the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b>, the stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> are encapsulated within the cementitious slab to form a composite joist floor system, once the concrete is cured. As will be described in greater detail below, this composite joist floor system allows for structures that can be assembled substantially error-free at much lower cost and to be stronger, lighter, and/or safer composite floor system. The term &#x201c;concrete&#x201d; here can be any of a number of cementitious materials or materials with properties similar to cementitious materials as may be accepted by governing building codes and/or desired in the particular embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, in an exemplary embodiment, each joist <b>110</b> comprises an upper chord <b>112</b> and a lower chord <b>111</b>. The upper chord <b>112</b> and the lower chord <b>111</b> are joined together by a web <b>118</b> extending there between. In the illustrated embodiment, the web <b>118</b> has an open web configuration comprising one or more of rod, angle, or cold-formed &#x201c;C&#x201d; shaped members <b>119</b> that extend between and are coupled to the upper chord <b>112</b> and the lower chord <b>111</b>. In the illustrated embodiment of the invention, the web <b>118</b> is made primarily from a single round solid rod <b>119</b> bent into a zigzag or sinusoidal-like pattern having one or more peaks alternating with valleys. In such an embodiment, the upper chord <b>112</b> is welded (or otherwise coupled) to the peaks in the bent rod <b>119</b> and the lower chord <b>111</b> is welded (or otherwise coupled) to the valleys in the bent rod <b>119</b>. These rods <b>119</b> may be of a low carbon steel composition which is generally used for rebar in reinforcing concrete.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the illustrated embodiment, the upper chords <b>112</b> and lower chords <b>111</b> may be each formed from two L-shaped metal members positioned back-to-back (also sometimes referred to as &#x201c;angle irons,&#x201d; although the angle members described generally are steel and not iron). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an embodiment where two angles <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> are placed on either side of the bent rod <b>119</b> forming the open web, and joined to the valleys in the bent rod <b>119</b> to form the lower chord <b>111</b>. Similarly, two angles <b>115</b> and <b>116</b> are placed on either side of the bent rod <b>119</b> and joined to the peaks in the bent rod <b>119</b> to form the upper chord <b>112</b>. The webs <b>118</b> are shown herein as bent rod <b>119</b>, but can be almost any cross-sectional shape. So that the composite joist floor system <b>100</b> is relatively light in weight, the L-shaped members forming the upper chord <b>112</b> and the lower chord <b>111</b> typically have relatively thin cross sections.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the joist <b>110</b> includes a rod-shaped &#x201c;end diagonal&#x201d; <b>117</b> at each end of the joist for transferring forces between the joist <b>110</b> and the supporting wall structure <b>101</b>. The &#x201c;end diagonal&#x201d; <b>117</b> may be L-shaped angles or cold-formed &#x201c;C&#x201d;-shaped sections suitable for heavier floor loadings. One end of the end diagonal <b>117</b> is joined to the lower chord <b>111</b> at or near a nearest joint of the web and the other end of diagonal <b>117</b> joined to the upper chord <b>112</b> at or near to the seat or joist shoe <b>170</b>. In some embodiments, the lower chord <b>111</b> of the joist <b>110</b> may include a ceiling extension <b>190</b> that extends the lower chord <b>111</b> such that the lower chord <b>111</b> ends proximate the wall structure <b>101</b> or beam if desired. Such an extension <b>190</b> may be provided as support for a ceiling <b>195</b> hung from the lower chord <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As described above, corrugated steel decking <b>180</b> is positioned over the joist <b>110</b> and with each decking section generally spanning two or more adjacent joists. The corrugated steel decking <b>180</b> may be painted, galvanized or otherwise coated as desired. Standard corrugated steel decking generally comes in the form of sheet sections in widths of 32, 33, or 36 inches. Besides coming in a variety of widths, standardized corrugated steel decking sections also comes in a number of different profiles and thicknesses, depending on the application. The type of corrugated steel decking primarily illustrated herein is 1.0 inch deep steel decking, although other types of decking may be used depending upon the application. The steel used in the steel decking and joist may be made by electric arc furnace from generally 70% recycled materials.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b> is generally positioned such that the corrugations run laterally to the joist <b>110</b> span. As described in detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B and <b>4</b>C, stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> are such to provide rapid and safe assembly of the composite joist floor system that is more potentially error-free and can support large loads. Stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> are drilled through the corrugated decking <b>180</b> and the flanges of the upper chord <b>112</b>, with the upper portion of the stand-off fasteners encapsulated in the concrete. The stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> transfer horizontal shear forces between the cementitious slab <b>120</b> and the joist upper chord of the joist <b>110</b> allowing the two structures to act more like a single unit. The composite structure may be significantly stronger and/or material and labor may be reduced in the floor system over non-composite systems. The cementitious floor slab <b>120</b> is designed with sufficient cementitious materials to provide the load bearing capacity of the composite floor system.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, the cementitious slab <b>120</b> is strengthened by placing reinforcing such as welded wire fabric <b>125</b> or other types of reinforcing over the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b>. When the cementitious slab <b>120</b> is placed over the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b>, the welded wire fabric <b>125</b> and the upper portion of the stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> are encapsulated within the cementitious slab <b>120</b>. The concrete is then smoothed so as to form a floor of the building. In some embodiments, ties or lifts are used to hold the welded wire fabric <b>125</b> in desired location above the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b> as the cementitious slab <b>120</b> is placed.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The composite joist floor system <b>100</b> described above provides many advantages over the traditional non-composite and composite floor systems. In non-composite floor systems, the joist and the cementitious slab share load based on the relative stiffness of each component and act substantially independently to support the bearing loads on the composite joist floor system. In previous composite joist floor systems, the steel joist, metal decking, and cementitious slab act as a composite and the system is relatively thin compared to its span (i.e., the length of the joist) where ease of installation and potential errors in the installation are a focus. Such composite joist floor system required additional large labor costs and requires anticipating potential broken and defectively installed stand-off fasteners. As such, prior composite joist floor systems were designed with more or heavier components to provide the same safety factors as needed for error-free assembly and installation of the composite floor systems. In contrast, the composite joist floor system described herein can be assembled and installed with low labor costs while reducing potential errors in installation. These factors, and because the stand-off fastener can be more effective to produce a composite floor system with high load bearing capacity, the overall cost of the composite joist floor system can be reduced and at the same time safer composite joist floor systems capable of higher load bearing capacity can be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">To explain, the cementitious slab <b>120</b> carries compression and the lower chord <b>111</b> of the joist <b>110</b> carries tension. As such, the design moment is based on the concrete strength, the steel strength, and the shear transfer between them. The stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> function as a shear transfer mechanism in the composite joist floor system and are the focus in the operation of the overall composite floor system. In this way, the material used in the structure can be reduced to reduce weight and costs depending on the effectiveness of the stand-off fasteners. Alternatively, the size and strength of the upper chord <b>112</b> can be reduced and transitioned to increase the size and strength of the lower chord <b>111</b> to achieve significant increases in load capacity without an increase in the amount of material in the joist. Therefore, in some embodiments of the present invention, the upper chord <b>112</b> of the joist <b>110</b> is smaller than the lower chord <b>111</b> or is formed from lower strength material compared to the material used to form the lower chord <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, as described above the end of the joist <b>110</b> is supported by a beam, a wall, or other structural support member. In the illustrated example, the end of the joist <b>110</b> is supported by the wall structure <b>101</b> comprising cold formed steel wall studs. The end of the upper chord <b>112</b> has a shoe <b>170</b> for transferring forces from the joist <b>110</b> to the wall <b>101</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the shoe <b>170</b> is made up of a pair of metal L-shaped angles positioned back-to-back and welded beneath the upper chord angles <b>115</b> and <b>116</b>. Configured as such, the angles <b>115</b> and <b>116</b> that make up the upper chord <b>112</b> and the angles <b>115</b> and <b>116</b> that make up the joist shoe <b>170</b> combine to form an I-beam like bearing connection. The end of the end diagonal <b>117</b> is positioned between the shoe angles <b>171</b> and <b>172</b> and serves as a spacer between the shoe angles. In this regard, the shoe angles <b>171</b> and <b>172</b> are welded to the end diagonal <b>117</b> in addition to being welded to the upper chord angles <b>115</b> and <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The lower surface of the joist shoe <b>170</b> rests upon and is supported by the wall structure <b>101</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a load distribution member <b>168</b> or header and/or a wall track <b>167</b> or plate may be positioned between the wall studs and the joist shoe <b>170</b> to distribute force along the length of the wall <b>101</b>. In other embodiments, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2B</figref>, a distribution member <b>168</b> may not be used.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, in some embodiments of the composite joist floor system <b>100</b>, the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b> does not extend significantly over the wall structure <b>101</b> or other supporting member. In this way, when the cementitious slab <b>120</b> is placed over the steel decking <b>180</b>, the concrete may flow into the region above the supporting wall <b>101</b> and forms cementitious composite beam <b>121</b> with encapsulated stand-off fastener <b>131</b> in the wall structure that is integral with the cementitious slab <b>120</b>. The concrete in the region <b>121</b> also encapsulates the ends of the upper chords <b>112</b> of each joist <b>110</b> and the ends of each joist shoe <b>170</b>, and functions to assist the load transfer of the joist shoes <b>170</b> to the upper portion of the wall structure <b>101</b>. The concrete in the region forms a cementitious beam <b>121</b> extending over the wall structure <b>101</b> lateral to the joists <b>110</b>. This cementitious beam helps to collect and distribute forces being transferred between the walls and the floor so there is no need for an additional load distribution element such as load distribution member <b>168</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a z-shaped closure <b>150</b> and a pour stop <b>160</b> are used to contain the concrete within the region <b>121</b> over the upper portion of the wall structure <b>101</b>. The composite joist floor system <b>100</b> with the integral cementitious beam <b>121</b> in the upper portion of the wall structure <b>101</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> may lead to improved fire-safety ratings, improved acoustic attenuation, and most importantly, a stronger and more economical overall building structure.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a pour stop <b>160</b> is used to prevent the cementitious slab <b>120</b> from flowing beyond the plane of the supporting wall <b>101</b> as the cementitious slab <b>120</b> is being placed and cured. The pour stop <b>160</b> has a lower lateral flange <b>161</b> and an upwardly extending face <b>162</b>. The lateral flange <b>161</b> rests on a tubular distribution member <b>168</b> and optionally may be coupled to the distribution member <b>168</b> by, for example, a stand-off fastener <b>131</b>. The pour stop <b>160</b> is positioned such that the upwardly extending face <b>162</b> is substantially within the same plane of the backside of the wall structure <b>101</b> so that the upwardly extending face <b>162</b> of the pour stop <b>160</b> prevents the concrete from flowing beyond this plane into the building exterior. The pour stop <b>160</b> may have an upper lip <b>163</b> in the upwardly extending face <b>162</b> that curves or is otherwise bent inward and downward toward the joist <b>110</b>. The lip <b>163</b> prevents the upwardly extending face <b>162</b> of the pour stop <b>160</b> from becoming separated from the cementitious slab <b>120</b> and, therefore, prevents moisture from entering between the pour stop upwardly extending face <b>162</b> and the cementitious slab <b>120</b>. Alternatively in some embodiments, the pour stop <b>160</b> may not include the lip <b>163</b>. In one exemplary embodiment, the height of the pour stop <b>160</b> is sized such that a 2.5 to 3-inch deep 3000 pounds per square inch minimum compressive strength cast-in place cementitious slab <b>120</b> is created over the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Opposite the pour stop <b>160</b>, a z-shaped closure <b>150</b> is provided. In combination with the joist <b>110</b> and the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b>, the z-shaped closure <b>150</b> functions to contain the concrete within the region <b>121</b> above the wall structure <b>101</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B, <b>3</b>C and <b>3</b>D illustrate a portion of a z-shaped closure <b>150</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the z-shaped closure <b>150</b> has a generally upwardly extending face <b>152</b>, with upper flange <b>153</b> extending away from the wall structure <b>101</b>, and a generally lateral lower flange <b>151</b> extending in a direction opposite from the upper flange <b>153</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the upwardly extending face <b>152</b> has a cutout <b>154</b> at one end. The cutout <b>154</b> has the shape of approximately one-half of an I-beam. This cutout <b>154</b> is configured to fit around at least one side of the I-beam formed by the combination of the upper chord <b>112</b> and the joist shoe <b>170</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. As also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the upwardly extending face <b>152</b> of the z-shaped closure extends upwards above the upper chord <b>112</b> so that the upper flange <b>153</b> extends above a peak or peaks in the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b>. Stand-off fasteners <b>131</b>, welds, pneumatic pins, or a variety of other fasteners may be used to couple the lower flange <b>151</b> to the supporting wall. Fasteners <b>133</b>, welds, pneumatic pins, or a variety of other fasteners may be used to couple and the upper flange <b>153</b> to a peak or peaks in the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, in some embodiments of the invention, the lower flange <b>151</b> is configured such that, before the z-shaped closure <b>150</b> is installed in the composite floor system <b>100</b>, the lower flange <b>151</b> may have an angle with the upwardly extending face <b>152</b> that is greater or lesser than 90 degrees with a tapered or forward angle to provide a desired set for the z-shaped member when installed. For example, the z-shaped closure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> forms a 100-degree angle between the upwardly extending face <b>152</b> and the lower flange <b>151</b>. When such a z-shaped closure <b>150</b> is installed in the floor system <b>100</b>, the z-shaped closure <b>150</b> may be pressed into position such that the angle between the upwardly extending face <b>152</b> and the lower flange <b>151</b> is reduced to an angle closer to 90 degrees. When the z-shaped closure <b>150</b> is installed in this manner, the resilient bias of the z-shaped closure <b>150</b> will press the lower flange <b>151</b> against the upper portion of the wall structure <b>101</b> and, thereby, create a better seal between the wall structure <b>101</b> and the z-shaped closure <b>150</b> than would have otherwise been formed using a z-shaped closure manufactured to have a 90-degree angle or other desired angle between the upwardly extending face <b>152</b> and the lower flange <b>151</b>. Alternatively, where space on the upper portion of the supporting wall is limited, the lower flange <b>151</b> may be shortened as desired for the application and fasteners used to attach the z-shaped closure to the supporting wall.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> of carbon steel as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4E</figref> have the upper portion <b>140</b> having a desired length and the lower portion <b>141</b>, where the lower portion has a clamping part <b>146</b> capable of clamping the decking <b>180</b> to the joists <b>110</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a fastener head <b>147</b> may be part of the clamping part <b>146</b>, or be a separate head <b>147</b> that is part of upper portion <b>140</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 4C</figref>. In any case, the fastener head of each stand-off fastener is adapted to be used in installing the stand-off fastener <b>130</b> and to engage in the cementitious slab <b>120</b> on installing of the fastener and placing the cementitious slab.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The lower portion <b>141</b> of the fastener <b>130</b> includes a threaded portion <b>142</b> adjacent the clamping part <b>146</b> having a hardness between about Rockwell B-Scale hardness (HRB) 70 and Rockwell C-Scale hardness (HRC) 40 through hardness, and includes a thread-forming portion <b>143</b> adjacent the threaded portion <b>142</b> of at least HRC 50 hardness adapted to enable the fastener to engage with formed threads in decking <b>180</b> and joist upper chords <b>112</b>. The lower portion <b>141</b> of the stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> may include a self-drilling end portion comprising the fluted lead portion <b>144</b> adjacent the thread-forming portion <b>143</b> of at least HRC 50 hardness with a nominal diameter between about 80 and 98% of the major diameter of the threaded portion <b>142</b> adapted to form a fastener opening. The fluted lead portion <b>144</b> drills through the decking <b>180</b> and flange of the upper chord of joists <b>110</b> during installation, and the thread-forming portion <b>143</b> forms threads in the bore of the drilled fastener opening for the threaded portion <b>142</b> to engage the decking <b>180</b> and the upper chord of joists <b>110</b>. The stand-off fastener <b>130</b> is seated by clamping part <b>146</b> to clamp with the threads engaging the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b> to joists <b>110</b>. Alternatively, the fluted lead portion <b>144</b> may have a nominal diameter between about 80% and 95% of the major diameter of the threaded portion <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The threaded portion <b>142</b> has a major diameter, the diameter of the fastener at the tip of the thread, and a minor diameter, the diameter of the fastener at the root of the thread. The threaded portion <b>142</b> has a desired thread pitch, the distance from one thread tip to the adjacent thread tip along the length of the threads. The stand-off fastener <b>130</b> typically has a major diameter between &#x215c; and &#xbc; inch.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The upper portion <b>140</b> may have a through hardness between about HRB 70 and HRC 40.

In one alternative, at least a portion of the upper portion <b>140</b> has a through hardness between about HRC 19 and HRC 30. In one alternative, at least a portion of the upper portion <b>140</b> has a through hardness between about HRC 26 and HRC 36.

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">To further improve the speed of assembly and improve the load carrying capacity of the composite floor the shape of the thread-forming portion <b>143</b> of the stand-off fastener <b>130</b> may be selected from the group consisting of bilobular, trilobular, quadlobular and pentalobular. Of these the quadlobular shape has been found to date to give the best performance in thread forming. In any event, these lobar shapes of the thread-forming portion <b>143</b> of the fastener <b>130</b> control the thread-forming torque to facilitate assembly of the composite floor system <b>100</b> and reduce failures in installation of the stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> and improve the load carrying capacity of the assembled composite floor system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In further explanation, the thread-forming portion <b>143</b> includes a plurality of relief recesses <b>145</b> spaced around the thread-forming portion <b>143</b> to segment the thread-forming portion into a desired number of lobes <b>139</b> forming the bilobular, trilobular, quadlobular, pentalobular, or other cross-sectional shape. For example, five relief recesses <b>145</b> may be spaced as desired around the thread-forming portion <b>143</b> to segment the thread-forming portion <b>143</b> into five lobes <b>139</b> forming the pentalobular cross-section shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>, and four relief recesses <b>145</b> may be spaced as desired around the thread-forming portion <b>143</b> to segment the thread-forming portion <b>143</b> into four lobes <b>139</b> forming the quadlobular cross-section also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>. The relief recesses <b>145</b> may be longitudinal recesses provided along the axial direction of the fastener. In one alternative, the width of the relief recesses <b>145</b> may be wider toward the fluted lead portion forming the triangular shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>. The relief recesses <b>145</b> may extend into the threads of the fastener <b>130</b> to about the minor diameter. Alternatively, the relief recesses <b>145</b> may extend into the fastener <b>130</b> deeper than the minor diameter, such as to a depth between about 80% and 99% of the minor diameter. In yet another alternative, the relief recesses <b>145</b> may extend into the threads of the fastener <b>130</b> to a depth between the major diameter and the minor diameter, such as to a depth between about 101% and 120% of the minor diameter. Each relief recess <b>145</b> may be about one thread pitch in width. Alternatively, the relief recesses <b>145</b> may be between about 0.8 and 4 thread pitches wide. In one alternative, the width of the relief recesses <b>145</b> may be between about 30% and 70% of the formula (&#x3c0;&#xd7;major diameter/number of lobes) as desired to provide desired separation between the lobes <b>139</b>. In yet another alternative, the width of the relief recesses <b>145</b> may be between about 40% and 65% of the formula (&#x3c0;&#xd7;major diameter/number of lobes). For example, in one application having 4 lobes (quadralobular), the width of the relief recesses may be approximately 60% of the formula (&#x3c0;&#xd7;major diameter/number of lobes). In another example, in one application having 2 lobes (bilobular), the width of the relief recesses may be approximately 50% of the formula (&#x3c0;&#xd7;major diameter/number of lobes). The relief recesses <b>145</b> of the thread-forming portion <b>143</b> may be between about 3 to 7 thread pitches in axial length. Alternatively, the relief recesses <b>145</b> of the thread-forming portion <b>143</b> may be between 2 and 5 thread pitches in axial length. Depending upon the size of the fastener, the thread-forming portion <b>143</b> may be between about 0.06 and 0.5 inches in length, and has failure torque to thread-forming torque of at least 3.0 and may be at least 4.0.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The fluted lead portion <b>144</b> may have a swaged or pinched point, a milled point, or a combination of both. The milled point alone, or in combination with preformed swaged or pinched point, is generally desired to ensure effectiveness of the fluted lead portion <b>144</b> in drilling through the decking and upper chord of the joist. The length of the fluted lead portion <b>144</b> may be longer than the thickness of the metal decking and the flange of the upper chord of the joist. It may be useful to provide the fluted lead portion <b>144</b> having an axial length between about 1.1 and 2.0 times the thickness of the metal decking and the flange of the upper chord of the joist.

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The stand-off fastener <b>130</b> has a drilling torque to rotate the fluted lead portion <b>144</b> into and forming the fastener opening. Additionally, the drive torque of the threaded portion <b>142</b> is at least 20% and may at be at least 50% less than the thread-forming torque. In one alternative, the drive torque is less than 30% of the thread-forming torque. The thread-forming torque of each stand-off fastener may be no more than 100 inch-pounds. Alternatively, the drive torque is between about 5% and 50% of the thread-forming torque. To reduce driving torque, the threaded portion <b>142</b> may include back-tapered threads, and may have a thread angle less than 60&#xb0;. Alternatively, the thread angle may be less than 50&#xb0;. In yet another alternative, such thread angle may be between 45 and 50&#xb0;. Reducing the thread angle also reduces the thread pitch and reduces the minor diameter. Back-tapered threads as used herein means that the major diameter of the threaded portion <b>142</b> adjacent the thread-forming portion <b>143</b> has a back-taper such that the major diameter is larger than the major diameter adjacent the clamping part <b>146</b>. In certain embodiments, the back-taper of the major diameter may be between about 0.0005 and 0.0025 inch per inch of axial length. Alternatively, the back-taper may be between about 0.001 and 0.003 inch per inch of length.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The failure torque is substantially more than the seating torque of the fastener <b>130</b>, which is more than the thread-forming torque. The threaded portion <b>142</b> of stand-off fastener <b>130</b> may have a seating torque of at least 80 inch-pounds, or between 80 and 450 inch-pounds, or greater, to provide the proper seating torque, depending on the size of the stand-off fastener <b>130</b> and type and properties of the decking, joist and other support material into which the stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> are threaded.</p>

The threaded portion may have a failure torque between about 80 and 450 inch-pounds. Alternatively, the threaded portion has strip torque of between 80 and 350 inch-pounds measured using a &#xbc; inch diameter fastener <b>130</b> with the fluted lead portion <b>144</b> having at least one diameter within nominal diameter between about 80% and 95% of the major diameter and installed in a first and second building member having a combined material thickness of about 0.125 inch (about 3.2 millimeter).

Typically, the stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> are made with a medium carbon steel, medium carbon alloy steel, or a weathering steel in conformance with the desired fastener standard.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the clamping part <b>146</b> of the lower portion <b>141</b> of each stand-off fastener <b>130</b> may include the fastener drive head adapted to be used in installing the stand-off fastener <b>130</b>, with the upper portion <b>140</b> of the stand-off fastener <b>130</b> sized to permit the stand-off fastener <b>130</b> to be installed into the decking <b>180</b> and the joist <b>110</b>. In this configuration, an anchor member <b>148</b> may be provided on the upper portion <b>140</b> for engagement and encapsulation in the cementitious slab <b>120</b>. The anchor member <b>148</b> may be a SEMS washer, or may be a press-fit member. As used herein, SEMS means a washer or other anchor or member held captive on the fastener where the dimension of the fastener on each side of the SEMS washer being larger than the washer hole prevents the SEMS washer from coming off. Optionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the stand-off fastener <b>130</b> may include threads <b>138</b> adjacent the end of upper portion <b>140</b> of the fastener configured to couple to a reinforcing member such as rebar or some other member that will effectively extend the length of the stand-off fastener. In one alternative shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 4C</figref>, the clamping part <b>146</b> may be a SEMS washer. Alternatively, the clamping part <b>146</b> may be an integral flange. The clamping part <b>146</b> may include serrations (not shown) adjacent the threaded portion <b>142</b> to engage the surface of the upper surface of the metal decking <b>180</b>, or other building member during installation. These embodiments improve the composite floor system by further reducing failures in positioning the fasteners, and at the same time reducing the time to assemble the floor system. The SEMS anchors or stake anchors are easy to produce and improve the load transfer capacity of the stand-off fasteners at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The resulting assembly improves the speed of assembly as well as improves the load carrying capacity of the composite joist floor system. The fastener <b>130</b> facilitates assembly of the composite floor system <b>100</b> and reduce failures in installation of the stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> increasing the load capacity of the assembled composite floor.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As described above and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the composite floor system is completed by providing cementitious slab <b>120</b> supported by the decking <b>180</b> and encapsulating the upper portion <b>140</b> of each stand-off fastener <b>130</b> extending above the decking a plurality of stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> installed through at least some of the valleys in the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b> and through a flange of the upper chord <b>112</b>. Because of the features of the stand-off fastener, the composite floor systems can be installed with low labor costs to form a composite floor system with reduced installation errors and an improved load bearing capacity. As further illustrated, a portion of each stand-off fastener <b>130</b> continues to extend upwards above the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b> after the stand-off fastener <b>130</b> is fully installed through the decking <b>180</b> and the upper chord <b>112</b>. The stand-off fastener <b>130</b> has a lower collar <b>149</b> that functions to secure the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b> to the upper chord <b>112</b>. In this way, the stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> are connected to the metal decking <b>180</b> and joist upper chord <b>112</b> to the cementitious slab <b>120</b> with few defective installations, improving the installation time as well as load bearing capacity of the assembled composite floor system. In other words, these stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> cause the cementitious slab <b>120</b> to function with the upper chord of the composite joist system <b>100</b> with a much larger load carrying capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In order for the stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> to more evenly transfer the horizontal shear loads along the length of the composite steel joist, the upper portion <b>140</b> of the stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> have a through hardness of between HRB 70 and HRC 40 to provide ductility. As the upper portion of the stand-off fasteners bends, shear load is shared with stand-off fasteners located throughout the length. However, in addition to being ductile enough to share the shear loads without breaking, the fluted lead portion <b>144</b> of lower portion <b>141</b> of stand-off fastener <b>130</b> must also have a hardness of at least HRC 50 to allow it to drill through the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b> and the upper chord <b>112</b> of the joist <b>110</b>. To accommodate both design requirements, the stand-off fastener <b>130</b> is specially heat treated so that the lower fastener portion of the stand-off fastener <b>130</b> has sufficient hardness for drilling while the upper portion remains sufficiently ductile.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> graph testing the threading-forming and threaded portion of simulated stand-off fasteners. The graph plots installation torque over time being threaded into a pre-drilled pilot hole to negate effects of the fluted lead portion in a test plate of two sheet thicknesses in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and one plate thickness in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As the thread-forming portion is driven into the pilot hole, the thread-forming torque is the largest torque used to rotate the thread-forming portion of the stand-off fastener into the pilot hole forming threads in the pilot hole. After the head makes contact with the test plate, further rotation advances the threaded portion into the threaded fastener opening with increasing torque as the head clamps the members against the threads formed in the pilot hole. The operator stops tightening the fastener at a seating torque as desired lower than the failure torque <b>187</b>. The seating torque is selected as desired between the drive torque and the failure torque. For some applications, the selected seating torque is greater than the thread-forming torque. Alternatively, for some applications the selected seating torque may about 80% of the failure torque. The drive torque <b>186</b> is the torque right before the torque rise to a seating torque, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. Continued rotation of the fastener may further increase the torque needed to turn the fastener until the connection fails at the failure torque <b>187</b>. The failure mode typically is determined by the thickness of the metal decking and the flange of the upper chord of the joist and the major diameter of the fastener <b>130</b>. When metal decking <b>180</b> and the flange of the upper chord of the joist <b>110</b> in which threads are formed are thin materials such as less than 14 gauge, or less than 16 gauge, the materials of metal decking and the flange of the upper chord may deform or fracture adjacent the fastener and the fastener ultimately strips-out at the failure torque. The failure torque <b>187</b> generally refers to strip torque in materials of thinner thickness. For certain material thicknesses, the fastener will fracture at the failure torque.</p>

Stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> are also are installed in above the beam <b>103</b> so that when cementitious material is placed over the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b> to form the slab <b>120</b>, the cementitious material is permitted to flow into the opening above the beam <b>103</b> to create a composite distribution/collector beam <b>121</b> extending above the steel beam <b>103</b>, with the stand-off fasteners the ends of the upper chords and the joist shoes encapsulated in the cementitious slab <b>120</b>.

In some embodiments, the stand-off fastener <b>130</b> may be a stand-off fastener as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> <b>4</b>B or <b>4</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b> may, in some embodiments, only extend over a portion of the supporting wall <b>101</b> so that the un-cured cementitious slab <b>120</b> can flow over the edge of the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b> and onto the upper portion of the cold-formed wall track <b>167</b> to form a cementitious beam <b>121</b> in the upper portion of the wall structure. If the composite floor is to end at the edge of the wall structure <b>101</b>, a pour stop <b>160</b>, such as the pour stop described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, may be used to contain and form the un-cured cementitious slab <b>120</b> during cementitious material placement.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As further illustrated, one or more stand-off fasteners <b>131</b> may be drilled through the cold-formed wall track <b>167</b> in the region over the wall structure <b>101</b> beyond the edge of the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b>. As will be described in greater detail below, using stand-off fasteners <b>131</b> in this manner at the upper portion of the wall structure <b>101</b> or other supporting members can provide significant structural advantages. For example, in some embodiments, the upper portion of the wall structure <b>101</b> is the cold-formed wall track <b>167</b>, or cold-formed steel section, connecting a plurality of cold-formed steel wall studs. Optionally, the load distribution member <b>168</b> may be provided at the upper portion of the wall structure <b>101</b> such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. The stand-off fasteners <b>131</b> installed along the top of the wall in the cold-formed steel wall track <b>167</b> or load distribution member <b>168</b> transfer forces between the cementitious slab <b>120</b> and the upper portion of the wall structure <b>101</b> allowing the two structures to act more like a single unit. As such, the structure may be significantly stronger and/or material and labor may be reduced in the floor system. Furthermore, as will also be described in greater detail below, stand-off fasteners <b>131</b> installed at the tops of shear walls may also have significant structural advantages with regard to transferring horizontal diaphragm forces from the floor to the shear wall.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the wall structure <b>101</b> is the proper height to directly support the edge of the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b>. In other embodiments, however, z-shaped closures may be used at the inside edge of the wall to support the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b>. In this way, a larger cementitious material distribution/collector beam can be created in the upper portion of the wall structure that can provide various structural advantages and improve the structure's fire safety rating. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> illustrates a partial cross-sectional view of a composite joist floor system <b>100</b> where an external masonry wall <b>101</b> that is substantially parallel to the floor joist <b>110</b> supports the edge of the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b> using a z-shaped closures <b>150</b> to support the edge of the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Alternatively or additionally, the stand-off fasteners <b>131</b> may be used to fasten the pour stops <b>160</b> and z-shaped closures <b>150</b> to the wall structure, reducing material and labor costs.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">More particularly, the z-shaped closure <b>150</b> comprises a generally lateral lower flange <b>151</b> that is coupled to the upper portion of the wall structure <b>101</b> by, for example, a masonry fastener <b>134</b>. The z-shaped closure <b>150</b> further comprises an upper flange <b>153</b> that abuts and supports the lower side of the edge of the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b>. Fasteners <b>133</b> may be used to couple the valleys in the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b> to the upper flanges <b>153</b> of the z-shaped closure <b>150</b>. An upwardly-extending face <b>152</b> extends between the upper and lower flanges and forms the wall forms of the cementitious beam <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Since the wall <b>101</b> is an external wall, a pour stop <b>160</b> is used to form the exterior wall of the cementitious slab <b>120</b> and beam <b>121</b>. The pour stop <b>160</b> comprises a lower flange <b>161</b> and an upwardly-extending face <b>152</b>. The lower flange, <b>161</b> may be coupled to the upper portion of the wall structure <b>101</b> by, for example, a masonry fastener <b>134</b>. It should be appreciated that the length of the upwardly-extending faces of the pour stop <b>160</b> and the z-shaped closure <b>150</b> determine the size of the cementitious distribution/collector beam <b>121</b> over the wall structure <b>101</b> and the distance that this beam <b>121</b> extends beneath the decking <b>180</b>. Therefore, the pour stops <b>160</b> and z-shaped closures <b>150</b> can be varied to change the structural characteristics of the composite floor system <b>100</b> depending on the design requirements. The pour stops <b>160</b> and z-shaped closures <b>150</b> can also be used to alter the noise attenuating and fire containing properties of the structure. Furthermore, when the supporting structure <b>101</b> is a masonry wall such as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, the height of the pour stop <b>160</b> and z-shaped closure <b>150</b> can be selected so that the height of the resulting cementitious beam <b>121</b> matches the masonry course height or some desired multiple thereof.</p>

Since the wall structure <b>101</b> supports corrugated decking <b>180</b> on each side of the wall <b>101</b>, two z-shaped closures <b>150</b> are used to support the decking <b>180</b>, respectively, and to create the channel forms for the cementitious distribution/collector beam <b>121</b> above the wall <b>101</b>. Typically fire caulking is required at the upper portion of a structural wall <b>101</b> or some other fire stop must be installed in the corrugations of the metal decking <b>180</b> between the decking and wall in order to meet the proper fire safety design requirements. However, the pour stops <b>160</b> and z-shaped closures <b>150</b> can also be varied to provide the cementitious distribution/collector beam <b>121</b> over the wall structure <b>101</b> as desired to alter the noise attenuating and fire containing properties of the structure.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Flush Seat Configuration for Composite Joist Floor System</heading>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates a partial cross-sectional side view of a composite joist floor system <b>100</b> where the joist <b>110</b> is supported by a wall structure <b>101</b> running laterally to the joist <b>110</b> in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. The configuration of the joist <b>110</b> and the joist shoe <b>170</b> are generally similar to the joists and joist shoes described above, however, the composite joist floor system <b>100</b> uses a &#x201c;flush seat&#x201d; configuration to support the end of the joist <b>110</b>. A flush seat is a metal plate positioned directly on the structural support, where the metal plate may be bent to better seat the joist on the wall structure under load.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, in the flush seat configuration of the composite joist floor system <b>100</b> the upper chord <b>112</b> is secured such that it is substantially directly on the upper portion of the supporting member <b>101</b>, with or without an intermediate distribution member <b>168</b> or header positioned at the upper portions of a supporting wall <b>101</b>. The flush seat configuration includes a generally flat main plate <b>201</b> that is welded to the upper surface of the end of the upper chord <b>112</b>. The horizontal plate <b>201</b> extends beyond the end of the upper chord <b>112</b> so that a portion of the plate <b>201</b> rests upon the upper portion of surface of the distribution member <b>168</b> or directly on the wall structure <b>101</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, a substantially downwardly-extending plate <b>202</b> extends downward from the main plate <b>201</b> at a location on the main plate <b>201</b> just beyond the end of the upper chord <b>112</b>. The downwardly-extending plate <b>202</b> extends downward typically to just below the lower surface of the joist shoe <b>170</b>. Typically, the downwardly-extending plate <b>202</b> extends downward between about &#x215b; inch and &#xbd; inch below the lower surface of the joist shoe <b>170</b>. The joist shoe <b>170</b> is welded to the joist such that it extends slightly (e.g., &#xbc; of inch) beyond the end of the upper chord <b>112</b>. This slight extension of the joist shoe <b>170</b> allows the downwardly-extending plate <b>202</b> to be welded to the horizontal plate <b>201</b> without interfering with the end of the joist upper chord <b>112</b>. The downwardly-extending plate <b>202</b> is welded with an upwardly extending weld and a lateral weld to the bottom of the joist shoe <b>170</b> to support the vertical load on the joist shoe <b>170</b> and to minimize eccentricity on the joist end.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the flush seat configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b> extends over the main plate <b>201</b> and ends after it extends approximately half way (or, for example, at least 1.5 inches) across the supporting wall <b>101</b>. As also illustrated, in some embodiments, the stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> may be installed into the joist upper chord <b>112</b> near the flush seat and positioned closer to each other than the typical spacing of the stand-off fasteners along the joist <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a flush seat configuration where two opposing joists <b>110</b> are supported by the same steel I-beam <b>103</b>.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, however, the corrugated steel decking <b>180</b> extends from the first joist <b>110</b> completely over the beam <b>103</b> to the second joist <b>110</b>. By reducing the space or height consumed by the joist above the structural beam <b>103</b>, more space or height may be allocated for the structural beam <b>103</b> allowing for the use of a beam with a greater depth, reduced weight, and corresponding lower cost. Alternatively, the space saved by the flush seat may allow for a greater useable area between a floor and ceiling for ducting, plumbing, wiring, or other building systems.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates another flush seat configuration of the composite joist floor system <b>100</b> where the flush bearing seat <b>200</b> is configured specifically for a masonry-type support member, such as a block wall structure, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Specifically, the portion of the main plate <b>201</b> extending beyond the downwardly-extending plate <b>202</b> is bent downward. In this way, the main plate <b>201</b> is pre-bent to concentrate the downward force more toward the center of the cementitious material channel <b>127</b> rather than toward the upper inside of the top block in the masonry wall <b>101</b>.</p>

In addition to transferring horizontal diaphragm loads <b>188</b> from the cementitious slab <b>120</b> to the wall structure, the techniques described herein also provide for the transfer of other forces between the two structures. For example, the force exerted by wind blowing against an exterior wall can be transferred from the wall structure <b>101</b> to the cementitious slab <b>120</b> more efficiently using the systems described herein. The corrugated decking <b>180</b> and the cementitious slab <b>120</b> are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> for clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref>, in addition to the friction between the cementitious slab <b>120</b> and the upper portion of the wall <b>101</b>, embodiments of the present invention use two primary techniques for transferring diaphragm shear forces <b>188</b> from the cementitious slab <b>120</b> to the wall structure <b>101</b>. In some embodiments of the present invention both techniques are used together, while in other embodiments of the present invention only one or none of the techniques may be used. In the first technique, the joist shoes <b>170</b> are attached to the top of the wall <b>101</b> by stand-off fasteners <b>131</b>. By securing the ends of the joists <b>110</b> to the upper portion of the wall structure <b>101</b> and by using the stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> to couple the joist <b>110</b> to the cementitious slab as described above, the shear forces are transferred from the slab <b>120</b> into the joist <b>110</b> by the stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> and then from the joist <b>110</b> into the wall structure <b>101</b> by the stand-off fastener <b>130</b> to attach the joist <b>110</b> to the wall structure <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, in one embodiment of the composite joist floor system <b>100</b>, the joist shoes <b>170</b> extend over the supporting wall <b>101</b> beyond the end of the joist upper chord <b>112</b> so that there is sufficient room for the stand-off fasteners <b>131</b> to be drilled and threaded through the joist shoe <b>170</b> and into the upper portion of the wall structure <b>101</b>.

<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In a second technique for transferring horizontal diaphragm forces from the cementitious slab <b>120</b> to the wall structure <b>101</b>, stand-off fasteners <b>131</b>, which may be the same size as or a different size from the stand-off fasteners <b>130</b> installed through the decking <b>180</b> and joists <b>110</b>, are installed in the upper portion of the wall structure <b>101</b> (or load distribution member, wall track, or header, as the case may be) as desired. The stand-off fasteners <b>131</b> function to transfer the diaphragm shear forces <b>188</b> from the cementitious slab <b>120</b> to the wall structure <b>101</b>. As described above with reference to stand-off fastener <b>130</b>, the stand-off fasteners <b>131</b> are heat treated in such a way that the lower portion of the stand-off fastener <b>131</b> has a greater hardness than the upper portion of the fastener.</p>
