<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/078,288, filed Jul. 3, 2008, entitled, &#x201c;Multi-Media Online Presentation System and Method,&#x201d; the entire disclosure which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to network-based multimedia presentations and more particularly to a system and methods for automatic media population of a style presentation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Multimedia is media and content that utilizes a combination of different content forms. The term is used in contrast to media that only utilizes traditional forms of printed or hand-produced text and still graphics. In general, multimedia includes a combination of text, audio, still images, animation, video, and interactivity content forms. Multimedia is usually recorded and played, displayed, or accessed by information content processing devices, such as computerized and electronic devices. Multimedia finds its application in various areas including, but not limited to, social marketing, advertisement, art, education, entertainment, engineering, medicine, mathematics, business, scientific research and spatial temporal applications.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A variety of online websites are presently available to enable the creation and presentation including the publication of some form of multimedia. For example, MixerCast enables a user to build a social marketing application from scratch. Scrapblog enables a user to combine photos, videos, audio and text to create multimedia scrapbooks. Smilebox facilitates &#x201c;creative messaging&#x201d; that draws elements from photo services, scrapbooking, and e-cards.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Each website will typically provide one or more online tools for the creation and customization of the multimedia. Such online tools and/or desktop tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator, etc., allow the user to collect, edit, create, and publish or distribute the multimedia. In this regard, various style presentations may be utilized, photos may be resized and text may be added, video may be inserted, and/or links to other sites or presentations may be provided. Despite providing some level of customization, multimedia tools currently available are often cumbersome and difficult to use and thus limit the self-expression and creativity of the non-professional user when creating multimedia presentations. Accordingly, there exists a need for a relatively more robust multimedia creation tool including a system and method for the automatic media population of a style presentation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For purposes of summarizing the disclosure, exemplary embodiments of systems and methods for automatic media population of a style presentation have been described herein.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Embodiments of the present disclosure related to systems and methods for the automatic media population of a style presentation. As indicated above, multimedia presentations may find application in various areas including, but not limited to, social marketing, advertisement, art, education, entertainment, engineering, medicine, mathematics, business, scientific research and spatial temporal applications.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment a system and method provides for a robust end-to-end digital media creation architecture that enables a user to create rich multi-media presentations and clips online with real-time editing and authoring, and then share or publish the media online. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the system <b>100</b> includes at least one client device <b>120</b> (e.g., network computing device), one or more multi-media distribution channels <b>140</b> (e.g., network server devices), and at least one service provider device <b>180</b> (e.g., network server device) in communication over the network <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, the network <b>160</b> may be implemented as a single network or a combination of multiple networks. For example, in various embodiments, the network <b>160</b> may include the Internet and/or one or more intranets, landline networks, wireless networks, and/or other appropriate types of communication networks. In another example, the network <b>160</b> may comprise a wireless telecommunications network (e.g., cellular phone network) adapted to communicate with other communication networks, such as the Internet. As such, in various embodiments, the at least one client device <b>120</b>, the multi-media distribution channels <b>140</b>, and the at least one service provider device <b>180</b> may be associated with a particular link (e.g., a link, such as a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) to an IP (Internet Protocol) address).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In various embodiments, the at least one client device <b>120</b> may be implemented using any appropriate combination of hardware and/or software configured for wired and/or wireless communication over the network <b>160</b>. The client device <b>120</b> may be implemented as a personal computing device (e.g., a personal computer (PC)) in communication with the network <b>160</b>, such as the Internet. In various other implementations, the client device <b>120</b> may be implemented as one or more wireless telephones (e.g., cell phones), personal digital assistants (PDAs), notebook computers, and/or various other generally known types of wired and/or wireless computing devices. It should be appreciated that the client device <b>120</b> may be referred to as a user device or customer device without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, the client device <b>120</b> includes a user interface application <b>122</b> that may be utilized by a user <b>102</b> to conduct information transactions with the distribution channels <b>140</b> and the service provider server <b>180</b> over the network <b>160</b>. For example, the user interface application <b>122</b> may be implemented as a multi-media presentation application to collect, create and publish information via the network <b>160</b>. In various implementations, multi-media presentations may be published to and/or shared with one or more of the multi-media channels <b>140</b> via the user interface application <b>122</b> over the network <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one implementation, the user interface application <b>122</b> comprises a software program, such as a graphical user interface (GUI), executable by a processor that is configured to interface and communicate with the multi-media channels <b>140</b> and the service provider server <b>180</b> via the network <b>160</b>. In another implementation, the user interface application <b>122</b> comprises a browser module that provides a network interface to browse information available over the network <b>160</b>. For example, the user interface application <b>122</b> may be implemented, in part, as a web browser to view information available over the network <b>160</b>. In another example, each member of the user group <b>102</b> is able to access multi-media websites via the one or more multi-media channels <b>140</b> to view, collect and publish multi-media presentations over the network <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In various embodiments, the client device <b>120</b> may include other applications as may be desired in one or more implementations to provide additional features available to the user <b>102</b>. In one example, such other applications may include security applications for implementing client-side security features, programmatic client applications for interfacing with appropriate application programming interfaces (APIs) over the network <b>160</b> or various other types of generally known programs and/or applications. In other examples, these other applications may interface with the user interface application <b>122</b> for improved efficiency and convenience. For example, files, data, and/or various types of information may be imported from multi-media software directly into the user interface application <b>122</b> for ease of access to multi-media files (e.g., audio, video, pictures, clip-art, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The client device <b>120</b> may include a user identifier, which may be implemented, for example, as operating system registry entries, cookies associated with the user interface application <b>122</b>, identifiers associated with hardware of the client device <b>120</b>, or various other appropriate identifiers. The user identifier may include attributes related to the user <b>102</b>, such as personal information (e.g., a user name, password, etc.). In one implementation, the user identifier may be passed to the service provider server <b>180</b> during publishing and/or sharing of a multi-media presentation.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, the multi-media distribution channels <b>140</b> may be maintained by one or more resource providers and/or entities (e.g., social networking sites, resource information sites, management sites, merchant sites, etc.) in communication with the network <b>160</b>. In this regard, the service provider server <b>180</b>, discussed below, may maintain or provide access to the one or more of the multi-media distribution channels. The multi-media distribution channels <b>140</b> may be implemented using any appropriate combination of hardware and/or software configured for wired and/or wireless communication over the network <b>160</b>. In one implementation, the multi-media distribution channels <b>140</b> may be implemented as a network computing device (e.g., a network server) in wired and/or wireless communication with the network <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the service provider server <b>180</b> may be maintained by an online transaction processing provider and/or entity in communication with the network <b>160</b>. As such, the service provider server <b>180</b> may be implemented using any appropriate combination of hardware and/or software configured for wired and/or wireless communication over the network <b>160</b>. In one implementation, the service provider server <b>180</b> may be implemented as a network computing device (e.g., a network server) in wired and/or wireless communication with the network <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the service provider server <b>180</b> includes a service interface application <b>182</b>, which may be adapted to interact with the client device <b>120</b> to facilitate the collection of media, as well as the creation including editing and the publishing and/or sharing of multimedia presentations over a network. In one example, the service provider server <b>180</b> may be provided and implemented by PayPal, Inc. of San Jose, Calif., USA.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The service application <b>182</b>, in one embodiment, utilizes a collect module <b>184</b>, a create module <b>186</b>, and a publish module <b>188</b> running on a standard web browser to collect information, create presentations, and publish presentations, respectively. As described in greater detail herein, the modules <b>184</b>, <b>186</b>, <b>188</b> enable users, such as the user <b>102</b>, to collect diverse types of audio and visual media, create rich multi-media presentations with real-time editing and authoring using media software, such as Flash, and then share and/or publish the rich multi-media presentations with other users via the network <b>160</b>. In one example, the collect, create, and publish modules <b>184</b>, <b>186</b>, <b>188</b> may be implemented within a standard web browser for interfacing with the user <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one implementation, the user <b>102</b> is able to share multi-media presentations with other users via the media channels <b>140</b> and/or embed multi-media presentations directly in webpages of other users. For example, the user <b>102</b> may provide a unique URL link for the multi-media presentation to other users. In another example, the user <b>102</b> may directly email multi-media presentations to multiple recipients and include a message with the email. In still another example, the user <b>102</b> may provide the source HTML (i.e., HyperText Markup Language) code to other users and/or embed the source HTML code directly into another user's webpage. Still other examples include the ability to publish multi-media presentations on a website to sell a particular item or service for purchase. For items and/or services, a media rich presentation may help users market and sell items and/or services, which may be valuable for high-end or high-priced items and/or services. Social and/or dating sites may utilize these multi-media presentations to provide online users with a way to better present themselves to other online users. In various implementations, some type of webpage may be presented in a more dynamic manner by utilizing Rich Site Summary (RSS) feeds, since, for example, a particular user's presentation may be continually changing with new media.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In various embodiments, the service provider server <b>180</b> may be configured to maintain, store and/or archive multi-media presentations in a database <b>190</b>, each of which may include information related to one or more users, such as the user <b>102</b>, and one or more multimedia channels, such as multimedia distributions channels <b>140</b>. In various examples, the multimedia presentations may include attributes stored as part thereof, and the attributes may be passed to the service provider server <b>180</b> as part of a creating, publishing and/or sharing the multi-media presentations.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in one embodiment, the collect module <b>184</b> enables the user <b>102</b> to collect audio, photographic images, video, and music media from various sources, such as a PC, RSS feeds, websites, and any other online source, via a user interface, such as the user interface application <b>122</b>. In various implementations, the user interface application <b>122</b> comprises multiple tabs and/or links for the various sources. Key words can be selected to search photos in Flickr or videos in YouTube. For example, typing in &#x201c;flamingo&#x201d; and selecting Flickr results in pictures of flamingos or photos matching the word &#x201c;flamingo&#x201d; from Flickr being presented on the user's GUI or media page. The user can then drag and drop desired pictures onto a storyboard on that same screen. The pictures can be edited into stacks if desired. For videos, a desired video can be placed onto the user's media page by typing in the corresponding URL in YouTube. The system can then display the complete as well as a series of shorter video clips. The whole video or selected shorter clips, as well as the photos can then be dragged and dropped into a storybook section to create a presentation from the media collected.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Once collected, the media may be saved and categorized in the database <b>190</b> and edited on the system site via the service provider server <b>180</b>. Editing may include one or more of sizing, rotating, overlying, moving and stacking various media backward and forward with an overlay or stack. Video may be broken up automatically by the service provider server <b>180</b> into smaller segments. Selected video segments may be combined and/or used as desired. Selected media may be placed on a virtual storyboard, such as a clipboard, on the same screen as the collection of media. Media may be edited either in the collection or in the storyboard. Placing desired media on the storyboard or clip board may be accomplished by dragging and dropping. In one example, the collect module <b>184</b> provides selected media on a storyboard. In another example, the collect module <b>184</b> provides media on a user's media page (i.e., not placed on the storyboard). In still another example, uploading media may be delayed until editing is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, the create module <b>186</b> enables the user <b>102</b> to place selected media onto a storyboard. The service provider server <b>180</b> may automatically suggest a story idea to launch the creative process, or the user <b>102</b> may select a specific style or presentation tool. Within the presentation, there may be multiple styles, such as a picture frame, a television, a billboard, etc. In one implementation, media from the storyboard may be dragged and dropped onto the presentation. In this regard, media may be placed within the viewing window of each type of style.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2H</figref>, the user can create a presentation from the media in the storybook section by selecting a style, such as a slide show, a photo slider, a room with different viewing areas including picture frames, etc. The media is then automatically loaded into the selected style. For example, a clustered set of photos may automatically play in frame, and a video clip may automatically play on a television. In another example, the branches of a tree are automatically filled with different selected media for viewing. Another style may be a page of postcards, such that when that style is selected, the previously chosen media is automatically filled into the postcards on a single page.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">More specifically, in one embodiment, once media is collected, a storyboard located on the right side of the user interface may be populated with the collected media by dragging and dropping one or more of the media items or cluster of media items collected from the various media sources from the media collection area onto the storyboard for later use in creating a media piece (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). In this regard, the storyboard may includes two items collected from the web, one item uploaded from a PC, and a cluster of four items also collected from the web (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>). Media positioned on the storyboard may be edited prior to creating a media piece. For example, individual items of media in a media cluster may be reordered (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>). Once media has been collected and edited, media piece creation may proceed by clicking the create arrow at the bottom of the user interface and then choosing to proceed to the create module <b>186</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As indicated above, to begin the process of creating a media piece the user may select a thumbnail from the presentation &#x201c;styles&#x201d; menu (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>). Presentation styles may include, but are not limited to, a picture frame, billboard, kaleidoscope, street scene, landscape, etc. Once a &#x201c;style&#x201d; is selected media from the storyboard will automatically flow into or populate the chosen &#x201c;style&#x201d; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2F</figref>, <b>2</b>G, and <b>2</b>H). In this regard, the presentation media shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> has automatically populated corresponding presentation elements with the chosen presentation style. Some styles, which support movement of media as part of a presentation style, may provide the user with the ability to customize various characteristics of the movement such as speed of media rotation, etc., within the style.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Once the style is chosen, the user may also select different variations of the style. Each particular style typically has a different set of variations suited for that style. For example, for the tree style, a user may select different types of frames on the branches to contain the media, a specific background may be selected from a user image, and different style trees may be used. For the photo slider, different types and styles of frames may be used, as well as different types of presentations, e.g., spacing between photos, no spacing, and background selection. For the page of postcards, the user may select different configurations of the postcards on the page as well as different backgrounds for the page.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Once in the style presentation, the media may be edited. For example, the media may be rotated, sized, cut-out (e.g., by selecting the boundaries of an image, such as with clicks to designate points along the boundary, enabling as coarse or fine a resolution as desired), moved forward or backward in relation to adjacent media, slide multiple images to add or remove spaces within the presentation, and adding a hotspot (e.g., selecting an area of the image for additional information, such as adding a link, video, text, etc.). Other editing features may include adding audio to the background, adding text, and/or distorting images. This further editing may depend on the style chosen, as different styles may have different editing capabilities. In one aspect, the editing may be achieved in real-time so that the user <b>102</b> may quickly and easily see the results and change them as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Various tools or modules may be combined, used, and/or modified to provide the user with different initial choices regarding the type of presentation and features desired for creating the multimedia presentation. For example, as described blow, the user may access a collage tool or application to create dynamic interactive panoramas with &#x201c;hot spots&#x201d; and layouts of photos, video, text and audio on an infinite stage. In one variation of collage the stage extends infinitely to the right, and when viewed there is a natural progression from left to right that can map well to linear narrative, time, or space. In another variation the stage extends infinity downward. Again, this presents a natural mapping to time, space, or narrative. The collage tool introduces a new creation platform for WYSIWYG online multimedia layout and sharing, offering the ability to include direct links and presentations.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one embodiment, the publish module <b>186</b> enables the user <b>102</b> to share, publish and/or distribute the presentation when, for example, the presentation is completed.
