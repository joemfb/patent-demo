<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A main surface of a silicon carbide substrate is inclined by an off angle in an off direction from {0001} plane of a hexagonal crystal. The main surface has such a characteristic that, among emitting regions emitting photoluminescent light having a wavelength exceeding 650 nm of the main surface caused by excitation light having higher energy than band-gap of the hexagonal silicon carbide, the number of those having a dimension of at most 15 &#x3bc;m in a direction perpendicular to the off direction and a dimension in a direction parallel to the off direction not larger than a value obtained by dividing penetration length of the excitation light in the hexagonal silicon carbide by a tangent of the off angle is at most 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>per 1 cm<sup>2</sup>. Accordingly, reverse leakage current can be reduced.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a silicon carbide substrate, a semiconductor device, a method of manufacturing a silicon carbide substrate, and a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, a silicon carbide substrate has come to be used for manufacturing semiconductor devices as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,314,520 (Patent Literature 1). As compared with silicon as a more widely used material, silicon carbide has wider band-gap. Therefore, a semiconductor device using a silicon carbide substrate has advantages such as high breakdown voltage and low on-resistance and, in addition, its property does not much degrade in high-temperature environment.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some semiconductor devices, a forward direction in which current should flow and a reverse direction in which current should not flow are defined. Here, it is desired that the current flowing in the reverse direction, or reverse leakage current, should be as small as possible. If a semiconductor device is manufactured using a silicon carbide substrate, however, the reverse leakage current tends to be large.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the following, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the figures.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a silicon carbide substrate in accordance with the present invention is a single crystal substrate <b>80</b> (silicon carbide substrate) formed of silicon carbide having hexagonal crystal structure. Single crystal substrate <b>80</b> has a side surface SD and a main surface M<b>80</b> surrounded by the side surface SD. Polytype of the hexagonal crystal is, preferably, 4H.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, main surface M<b>80</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is tilted by an off angle OA relative to {0001} plane of the hexagonal crystal HX. Specifically, normal direction DZ of main surface M<b>80</b> is inclined by off angle OA from &#x3c;0001&#x3e; direction. The tilting is in off direction DX. In the figure, a direction DY represents a direction perpendicular to the direction DX. In the present embodiment, the off direction DX corresponds to &#x3c;11-20&#x3e; direction on the {0001} plane.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Main surface M<b>80</b> of single crystal substrate <b>80</b> has specific photoluminescence characteristics as will be described later. Measurement of photoluminescence and an apparatus used for measurement will be described in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a photoluminescence measuring apparatus <b>400</b> has an excitation light generating unit <b>420</b> and a microscope unit <b>430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Excitation light generating unit <b>420</b> has a light source section <b>421</b>, a light guiding section <b>422</b> and a filter <b>423</b>. Light source section <b>421</b> is a light source involving energy component higher than band-gap of hexagonal crystal silicon carbide and, by way of example, it is a mercury lamp. Light guiding section <b>422</b> guides the light emitted from light source section <b>421</b> and, by way of example, it includes an optical fiber. Filter <b>423</b> is for selectively passing light having a specific wavelength corresponding to the energy higher than the band-gap of hexagonal crystal silicon carbide. The wavelength corresponding to the band-gap of hexagonal crystal silicon carbide is typically about 390 nm. Therefore, a band-pass filter that particularly passes light having the wavelength of about 313 nm, for example, may be used as filter <b>423</b>. By this configuration, excitation light generating unit <b>420</b> can emit excitation light LE having higher energy than the band-gap of hexagonal crystal silicon carbide.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Microscope unit <b>430</b> has a control section <b>431</b>, a stage <b>432</b>, an optical system <b>433</b>, a filter <b>434</b> and a camera <b>435</b>. Control section <b>431</b> controls an operation of changing position of stage <b>432</b> and controls an operation of image pick-up by camera <b>435</b> and, by way of example, it is implemented by a personal computer. Stage <b>432</b> is for supporting single crystal substrate <b>80</b> to have main surface M<b>80</b> exposed and for changing position of main surface M<b>80</b> and, by way of example, it is an X-Y stage. Optical system <b>433</b> is for receiving photoluminescent light LL emitted from main surface M<b>80</b> excited by excitation light LE. Camera <b>435</b> is for picking-up an image formed by transmitted light LH that has passed through filter <b>434</b> and for transmitting the data to control section <b>431</b> and, by way of example, it is a CCD camera.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Filter <b>434</b> selectively passes light having a wavelength exceeding 650 nm, of the light received by optical system <b>433</b>. Here, &#x201c;selectively passes light having a wavelength exceeding 650 nm&#x201d; means that it substantially does not pass light in the wavelength range of 650 nm or shorter, and passes light in at least a part of the wavelength range exceeding 650 nm. Filter <b>434</b> may be a filter that selectively passes light having a wavelength longer than a prescribed wavelength. Alternatively, filter <b>434</b> may be a band-pass filter. Filter <b>434</b> may be one that selectively passes a wavelength exceeding 750 nm, or filter <b>434</b> may be one that selectively passes a wavelength exceeding 650 nm and shorter than 950 nm. Here, &#x201c;selectively passes a wavelength exceeding 650 nm and shorter than 950 nm&#x201d; means that it substantially does not pass light in the wavelength ranges of 650 nm or shorter and 950 nm or longer, and passes light in at least part of the wavelength range exceeding 650 nm and shorter than 950 nm. Filter <b>434</b> may be one that passes a wavelength exceeding 750 nm and shorter than 950 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Next, how to use photoluminescence measuring apparatus <b>400</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Main surface M<b>80</b> of single crystal substrate <b>80</b> is irradiated with excitation light LE. Consequently, emission of photoluminescent light LL occurs on main surface M<b>80</b>. Transmitted light LH, which is photoluminescent light LL passed through filter <b>434</b>, is observed as an image by camera <b>435</b>. Specifically, on main surface M<b>80</b>, photoluminescent light LL having a wavelength longer than 650 nm is observed. Which range of the wavelength exceeding 650 nm is observed is determined by characteristics of filter <b>434</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, regions RL emitting photoluminescent light LL is observed. Emitting region RL is a region that emits light of higher intensity than surrounding regions, and it can be observed as a relatively brighter region. Maximum dimensions LX and LY along the directions DX and DY, respectively, are calculated for each emitting region RL. Of the emitting regions RL, the number of those having the dimension LX not larger than a value obtained by dividing penetration length of excitation light LE to the hexagonal crystal silicon carbide by a tangent of off angle OA and having the dimension LY not larger than 15 &#x3bc;m is counted. Then, the obtained number is divided by the area (cm<sup>2</sup>) of a portion as an object of observation of main surface M<b>80</b>. The resulting value is a characteristic value that serves as an index of photoluminescence characteristics of main surface M<b>80</b> of single crystal substrate <b>80</b>. The main surface M<b>80</b> of single crystal substrate <b>80</b> in accordance with the present embodiment has this characteristic value of 1&#xd7;10<sup>4</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>or smaller.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The penetration length represents a length, vertical to the observed main surface, of the light incident on the main surface to a point where its intensity is attenuated to the ratio of 1/e (e is Napier's constant).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Preferably, even if counting of the number of emitting regions RL takes place unconditionally, that is, if the counting is done without the limitation of dimensions LX and LY, main surface M<b>80</b> still has the value of 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>per 1 cm<sup>2 </sup>or smaller, as the characteristic value.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Next, the method of manufacturing single crystal substrate <b>80</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, silicon carbide single crystals <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>i </i>(also generally denoted by <b>70</b>) each having a main surface M<b>70</b> are prepared. Silicon carbide single crystal <b>70</b> has hexagonal crystal structure and preferably has polytype of 4H. Plane direction of main surface M<b>70</b> corresponds to plane direction of main surface M<b>80</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Thickness (dimension in the lengthwise direction in the figure) of silicon carbide single crystal <b>70</b> is, for example, 0.5 mm to 10 mm. Planar shape of silicon carbide single crystal <b>70</b> is, for example, circular, of which diameter is preferably 25 mm or larger and, more preferably, 100 mm or larger.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, photoluminescence of main surface M<b>70</b> of each of silicon carbide single crystals <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>i </i>is measured. Consequently, characteristic value as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> is calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, of silicon carbide single crystals <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>i</i>, one having the characteristic value smaller than a prescribed value is selected as a seed crystal <b>70</b>S. The prescribed value is, for example, the criterion of main surface M<b>80</b>, that is, 1&#xd7;10<sup>4</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Next, backside (opposite to main surface M<b>70</b>) of seed crystal <b>70</b>S is processed to increase surface roughness. This process is done by polishing the backside surface using abrasive particles having sufficiently large particle diameter. Particle size distribution of abrasive particles preferably has a component of 16 &#x3bc;m or larger. Average particle size of abrasive particles is preferably 5 &#x3bc;m to 50 &#x3bc;m, and more preferably 10 &#x3bc;m to 30 &#x3bc;m, and further preferably 12 to 25 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Preferably, the abrasive particles are diamond particles. Further, preferably, the abrasive particles are used dispersed in slurry. Therefore, the polishing mentioned above is preferably conducted using diamond slurry. Generally, diamond slurry containing diamond particles having average particle size of 5 &#x3bc;m to 50 &#x3bc;m and having component of 16 &#x3bc;m in particle distribution is readily available.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Instead of conducting the step of increasing surface roughness of the backside surface of seed crystal <b>70</b>S, a backside surface having sufficient surface roughness may be formed from the outset, and the backside surface may be used without polishing. Specifically, backside surface of seed crystal <b>70</b>S formed by slicing with wire saw may be used without polishing. In other words, as the backside surface, as-sliced surface formed by slicing and not subjected to subsequent polishing may be used. Preferably, at the time of slicing with wire saw, the abrasive particles mentioned above are used.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Next, on the backside surface of seed crystal <b>70</b>S, a coating film <b>21</b> including carbon is formed. Preferably, surface roughness of coating film <b>21</b> is made smaller than the surface roughness of backside surface of seed crystal <b>70</b>S on which coating film <b>21</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Preferably, the coating film is formed by applying liquid material and, more preferably, the liquid material does not contain any solid matter. Therefore, thin coating film <b>21</b> can be formed easily and uniformly.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the present embodiment, coating film <b>21</b> is an organic film. The organic film is preferably formed of an organic resin. As the organic resin, acrylic resin, phenol resin, urea resin or epoxy resin may be used, or resin having composition of photosensitive resin that is cross-linked or decomposed by light may be used. As the photosensitive resin, a positive or negative photoresist used for manufacturing semiconductor devices may be used. Regarding the photoresists, application technique of spin-coating has been established and, therefore, thickness of coating film <b>21</b> can be regulated easily. Exemplary manner of spin-coating is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">First, seed crystal <b>70</b>S is held by suction on a holder. The holder is rotated at a prescribed speed of rotation, so that seed crystal <b>70</b>S is also rotated. A photoresist is dropped on rotating seed crystal <b>70</b>S and rotation is continued for a prescribed time period, so that the photoresist is applied thin and uniform. In order to ensure uniformity over the entire surface of seed crystal <b>70</b>S, the speed of rotation is set, for example, to 1000 to 10000 rpm, time of rotation is set to 10 to 100 seconds and the coating thickness is at least 0.1 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Thereafter, the applied photoresist is dried and solidified. The temperature and time for drying may appropriately be selected in accordance with the material and coating thickness of photoresist. Preferably, the drying temperature is at least 100&#xb0; C. and at most 400&#xb0; C., and the drying time is at least 5 minutes and at most 60 minutes. If the drying temperature is 120&#xb0; C., the time necessary for volatilization is 15 minutes for the thickness of 5 &#x3bc;m, 8 minutes for the thickness of 2 &#x3bc;m and 3 minutes for the thickness of 1 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Though coating film <b>21</b> can be formed by once performing the process including the application and drying steps described above, thicker coating film <b>21</b> may be formed by repeating the process steps. If the number of repetition is too large, time for this process would be undesirably long and, therefore, typically the repetition of twice or three times is preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a base <b>41</b> having a mounting surface, on which seed crystal <b>70</b>S is mounted, is prepared. The mounting surface preferably includes a surface formed of carbon. By way of example, base <b>41</b> is formed of graphite. Preferably, the mounting surface is polished to improve flatness of the mounting surface.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Thereafter, coating film <b>21</b> and base <b>41</b> are brought into contact with each other with adhesive <b>31</b> interposed. Preferably, the contact is attained at a temperature of at least 50&#xb0; C. and at most 120&#xb0; C. under pressure of at least 0.01 Pa and at most 1 MPa to press the film and base to each other.

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the silicon carbide substrate in accordance with the present embodiment is an epitaxial substrate <b>90</b> (silicon carbide substrate) having a silicon carbide layer <b>81</b> with a main surface M<b>90</b> and a single crystal substrate <b>80</b> (base substrate) supporting silicon carbide layer <b>81</b>. Silicon carbide layer <b>81</b> is epitaxially formed on single crystal substrate <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Main surface M<b>90</b> of epitaxial substrate <b>90</b> has specific photoluminescence characteristics as described later. A method of measuring photoluminescence characteristics will be described in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, epitaxial substrate <b>90</b> is mounted on a photoluminescence measuring apparatus <b>400</b>. Main surface M<b>90</b> of epitaxial substrate <b>90</b> is irradiated with excitation light LE. Consequently, emission of photoluminescent light LL occurs on main surface M<b>90</b>. Transmitted light LH, which is photoluminescent light LL passed through filter <b>434</b>, is observed as an image by camera <b>435</b>. Specifically, on main surface M<b>90</b>, emitting regions emitting photoluminescent light LL having a wavelength longer than 650 nm are observed.

<p id="p-0098" num="0097">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, maximum dimensions LX and LY along the directions DX and DY, respectively, are calculated for each emitting region RL.

The main surface M<b>90</b> of epitaxial substrate <b>90</b> in accordance with the present embodiment has this characteristic value of 1&#xd7;10<sup>4</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>or smaller.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Preferably, even if counting of the number of emitting regions RL takes place unconditionally, that is, if the counting is done without the limitation of dimensions LX and LY, main surface M<b>90</b> still has the value of 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>per 1 cm<sup>2 </sup>or smaller, as the characteristic value.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Except for the points described above, the configuration is substantially the same as that of Embodiment 1 above and, therefore, the same or corresponding components are denoted by the same reference characters and description thereof will not be repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, an example of the result of photoluminescence measurement will be described in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">A single crystal substrate <b>80</b> having polytype 4H crystal structure was prepared. Main surface M<b>80</b> of single crystal substrate <b>80</b> has an off angle OA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of 8 degrees from (0001) plane. Silicon carbide layer <b>81</b> of 10 &#x3bc;m in thickness was formed on main surface M<b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Photoluminescence of main surface M<b>90</b> of silicon carbide layer <b>81</b> was measured (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). Light emitted from a mercury lamp and passed through band-pass type filter <b>423</b> particularly passing light having the wavelength of about 313 nm was used as excitation light LE for measurement. Images of photoluminescent light LL caused by excitation light LE were picked up through filter <b>434</b> that particularly passes light having a wavelength of 750 nm or longer (a filter particularly prevents passage of light having cutoff wavelength shorter than 750 nm), whereby emitting regions RL were observed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). Typical dimension of emitting regions RL was about 50 &#x3bc;m in the off direction DX and at most 15 &#x3bc;m and about 10 &#x3bc;m in average in direction DY perpendicular to off direction DX.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Easiness of observing emitting regions RL depends on the characteristics of filter <b>434</b>, and without filter <b>434</b>, accurate observation of emitting regions RL was impossible.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">When the incident angle of excitation light LE to main surface M<b>90</b> was changed, the dimension of emitting regions RL hardly changed in direction DY while the dimension becomes smaller as the incident angle becomes larger in direction DX. Specifically, the dimension in direction DX was in proportion to inverse tangent of the incident angle.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Maximum dimensions LX and LY along the directions DX and DY, respectively, were calculated for each emitting region RL. Of the emitting regions RL, the number of those having the dimension LX not larger than a value obtained by dividing penetration length of excitation light LE to the hexagonal crystal silicon carbide by a tangent of off angle OA and having the dimension LY not larger than 15 &#x3bc;m was counted. Then, the obtained number was divided by the area (cm<sup>2</sup>) of a portion as an object of observation of main surface M<b>80</b>. In Schottky diodes fabricated by using samples (epitaxial substrate <b>90</b> as an example of the invention) having the resulting value (characteristic value) of 1&#xd7;10<sup>4</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>or smaller, no abnormality in reverse leakage current was observed. In contrast, in Schottky diodes fabricated by using samples (epitaxial substrate as a comparative example) having the characteristic value exceeding 1&#xd7;10<sup>4</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>, reverse leakage current sometimes became abnormally high. Possible reason is as follows. If defects, which are detected by the photoluminescence measurement, exist on an outer periphery of a diode, reverse leakage current sometimes tends to be large, and if the characteristic value exceeds 1&#xd7;10<sup>4</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>, the number of defects tends to increase at the outer peripheral portion.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, spectrum of photoluminescent light LL from emitting region RL of main surface M<b>90</b> and the spectrum of photoluminescent light LL from other regions on main surface M<b>90</b> were compared, in the range of wavelength from 650 nm to 950 nm (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). The spectrum of emitting region RL had higher intensity in a specific wavelength range than the spectrum of other regions BG. The difference in intensity is considered to be the reason why emitting region RL is brighter than the surrounding regions. The wavelength range was between 650 nm and 950 nm. Further, intensity was higher in a lower wavelength range. Therefore, it is considered preferable for highly accurate observation of emitting regions RL, to remove light having the wavelength outside the above-described wavelength range and, particularly, to remove light having a wavelength shorter than the wavelength range. Further, since the difference in intensity between the spectra was significantly large at the range exceeding 750 nm, use of a filter that passes light exceeding 750 nm is preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As described above, according to the present embodiment, photoluminescence characteristic of main surface M<b>90</b> of epitaxial substrate <b>90</b> has the above-described characteristic value. By manufacturing a semiconductor device that should desirably have small reverse leakage current such as a Schottky diode or an MOSFET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) as will be described later using epitaxial substrate <b>90</b>, the reverse leakage current can be made smaller.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In the present embodiment, what is necessary is that main surface M<b>90</b> of silicon carbide layer <b>81</b> has the desired photoluminescence characteristic, and photoluminescence characteristic of main surface M<b>80</b> of single crystal substrate <b>80</b> may not necessarily satisfy the criterion described in Embodiment 1. If main surface M<b>80</b> of single crystal substrate <b>80</b> satisfies the criterion described in Embodiment 1, however, desired photoluminescence characteristic can be imparted more reliably on the main surface M<b>90</b> of silicon carbide layer <b>81</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Operation of Schottky diode <b>500</b> will be described. At a contact portion between anode electrode <b>225</b> and silicon carbide layer <b>81</b>, a Schottky barrier is formed.

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">On the other hand, if a positive voltage is applied to anode electrode <b>225</b>, the Schottky barrier is eliminated in accordance with the magnitude of applied voltage and the depletion layer in silicon carbide layer <b>81</b> also disappears.

<p id="p-0133" num="0132">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, by epitaxial growth on the main surface of single crystal substrate <b>80</b>, silicon carbide layer <b>81</b>V is formed. Specifically, on the main surface of single crystal substrate <b>80</b>, buffer layer <b>121</b> is formed, and on buffer layer <b>121</b>, breakdown voltage holding layer <b>122</b> is formed. Thus, epitaxial substrate <b>90</b>V is formed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>: step <b>110</b>). Buffer layer <b>121</b> is formed of silicon carbide having n type conductivity, and its thickness is about 0.5 &#x3bc;m. Further, impurity concentration in buffer layer <b>121</b> is, for example, 5&#xd7;10<sup>17 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>. Thickness of breakdown voltage holding layer <b>122</b> is, for example, 10 &#x3bc;m. Further, concentration of n type conductive impurity is, for example, 5&#xd7;10<sup>15 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Next, photoluminescence of the main surface (upper surface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>) of epitaxial substrate <b>90</b>V is measured substantially in the same manner as in Embodiment 3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>: step S<b>120</b>). If a defective region or regions are removed by the unit of substrate as in Embodiment 3, any defective epitaxial substrate is removed at this stage from the manufacturing process of MOSFET <b>100</b>. On the other hand, if a defective region or regions are removed as parts of one substrate as in the modification 3 of Embodiment 3, removal from the manufacturing process of epitaxial substrate does not take place here, but the defective regions are removed after the dicing step described later.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, by the implantation step (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>: step S<b>130</b>), p region <b>123</b>, n<sup>+</sup> region <b>124</b> and p<sup>+</sup> region <b>125</b> are formed in the following manner.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">First, p-type impurity is selectively introduced to a part of breakdown voltage holding layer <b>122</b>, so that p region <b>123</b> is formed. Next, n-type conductive impurity is selectively introduced to a prescribed region to form n<sup>+</sup> region <b>124</b>, and p-type conductive impurity is selectively introduced to a prescribed region to form p<sup>+</sup> region <b>125</b>. Selective introduction of impurities is done using a mask formed, for example, of an oxide film.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Following the implantation step as such, an activation annealing treatment is done. By way of example, annealing is done in an argon atmosphere, at a heating temperature of 1700&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the gate insulating film forming step (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>: step S<b>140</b>) is performed. Specifically, oxide film <b>126</b> is formed to cover breakdown voltage holding layer <b>122</b>, p region <b>123</b>, n<sup>+</sup> region <b>124</b> and p<sup>+</sup> region <b>125</b>. The film may be formed by dry oxidation (thermal oxidation). Conditions for dry oxidation are, for example, heating temperature of 1200&#xb0; C. and heating time of 30 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Thereafter, the nitrogen annealing step (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>: step S<b>150</b>) is done. Specifically, annealing is done in a nitrogen monoxide (NO) atmosphere. Conditions for this process are, for example, heating temperature of 1100&#xb0; C. and heating time of 120 minutes. As a result, nitrogen atoms are introduced to the vicinity of interface between oxide film <b>126</b> and each of breakdown voltage holding layer <b>122</b>, p region <b>123</b>, n<sup>+</sup> region <b>124</b> and p<sup>+</sup> region <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Following the annealing step using nitrogen monoxide, annealing using argon (Ar) gas as an inert gas may be performed. Conditions for the process are, for example, heating temperature of 1100&#xb0; C. and heating time of 60 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, by the electrode forming step (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>: step S<b>160</b>), source electrode <b>111</b> and drain electrode <b>112</b> are formed in the following manner.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">First, on oxide film <b>126</b>, using photolithography, a resist film having a pattern is formed. Using the resist film as a mask, portions of oxide film <b>126</b> positioned on n<sup>+</sup> region <b>124</b> and p<sup>+</sup> region <b>125</b> are removed by etching. Thus, openings are formed in oxide film <b>126</b>. Next, a conductive film is formed to be in contact with each of n<sup>+</sup> region <b>124</b> and p<sup>+</sup> region <b>125</b> in the openings. Then, the resist film is removed, whereby portions of the conductive film that have been positioned on the resist film are removed (lift off). The conductive film may be a metal film and, by way of example, it is formed of nickel (Ni). As a result of this lift off, source electrode <b>111</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Here, heat treatment for alloying is preferably carried out. By way of example, heat treatment is done in an atmosphere of argon (Ar) gas as an inert gas, at a heating temperature of 950&#xb0; C. for 2 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Again referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, on source electrode <b>111</b>, upper source electrode <b>127</b> is formed. Further, on oxide film <b>126</b>, gate electrode <b>110</b> is formed. Further, on the backside surface (lower surface in the figure) of single crystal substrate <b>80</b>, drain electrode <b>112</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Next, the dicing step (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>: step S<b>170</b>) is executed substantially in the similar manner as the dicing along dotted lines LD in Embodiment 3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>). Thus, a plurality of chips are cut out. If the defective regions in one substrate are removed as in the modification of Embodiment 3, chips including defective regions are removed from the plurality of chips.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">By the above-described manner, MOSFET <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>) is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">It is noted that a structure having conductivity types reversed from the structure described above, that is, p-type and n-type reversed, may be used. Further, though a vertical DiMOSFET has been described as an example, other semiconductor devices may be manufactured using the composite substrate in accordance with the present invention. For instance, a RESURF-JFET (Reduced Surface Field-Junction Field Effect Transistor) may be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the scope of the present invention being interpreted by the terms of the appended claims.</p>
