Electrical isolation between the first and second photoelectric conversion devices is provided by a photoelectron barrier, which may be an optically transparent electrically insulating material. MOS transistors may be utilized to transfer photoelectrons generated within the first and second photoelectric conversion devices to a floating diffusion region within the image sensor. These transistors may represent one example of means for transferring photoelectrons generated in the first and second photoelectric conversion devices to a floating diffusion region in the substrate, in response to first and second gating signals, respectively. The first and second gating signals may be active during non-overlapping time intervals.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">REFERENCE TO PRIORITY APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2009-0118151, filed Dec. 2, 2009, the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the invention relate to image processing technologies and, more particularly, to image sensors having two-layer structures, image processing apparatus including the same and manufacturing methods of image sensors.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The image sensor is a device that converts optical signals to digital signals. A general image sensor includes a plurality of pixels and a signal processing circuit. Each of the plurality of pixels includes a photoelectric conversion element and a plurality of transistors. The plurality of transistors are used to transmit a pixel signal generated by the photoelectric conversion element to the signal processing circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The signal processing circuit generates digital signals corresponding to optical signals by processing a pixel signal output from each of the plurality of pixels. A display device displays a digital image corresponding to an optical image in response to digital signals output from the signal processing circuit. An image quality of a digital image is affected not only by a signal processing function of a signal processing circuit, but also by the pixel structure that converts an optical signal to an electrical signal.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Image sensor embodiments according to embodiments of the invention include a second photoelectric conversion device disposed in a lower portion of a substrate and a first photoelectric conversion device extending between the secondary photoelectric conversion device and a light receiving surface of the substrate. Electrical isolation between the first and second photoelectric conversion devices can be provided by a photoelectron barrier, which may be an optically transparent electrically insulating material, such as silicon dioxide, silicon nitride or silicon oxynitride. According to some additional embodiments of the invention, MOS transistors may be utilized to transfer photoelectrons generated within the first and second photoelectric conversion devices to a floating diffusion region within the image sensor.

A reflection film may also be provided on a surface of the substrate extending opposite the light receiving surface.</p>
