<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure generally relates to heat transfer apparatuses, and particularly to a loop heat pipe with a high heat transfer efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Loop heat pipes are widely used in various fields for heat dissipation purposes due to their excellent heat transfer performance. A commonly used loop heat pipe includes an evaporator thermally attached to a heat-generating electronic component, a condenser, and a vapor line and a liquid line respectively interconnected between the evaporator and the condenser. A predetermined quantity of bi-phase working medium is contained in the loop heat pipe. A wick structure, lining an inner surface of the evaporator, draws condensed working medium back to the evaporator after the working medium in vaporized form has condensed at the condenser.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In operation of the loop heat pipe, the working medium conveys heat from the evaporator to the condenser. More specifically, the working medium in a liquid state contained in the wick structure of the evaporator absorbs heat from the heat-generating electronic component and vaporizes to the vapor state. The working medium in the vapor state moves through the vapor line toward the condenser, carrying heat with it. At the condenser, the working medium in the vapor state dissipates the heat to the ambient environment and condenses back to the liquid state, and then flows back to the evaporator through the liquid line to start another heat transfer cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">If the wick structure of the evaporator is too thick, the working medium in the liquid state contained in the wick structure of the evaporator cannot be completely vaporized in a timely manner. Therefore, part of the working medium in the liquid state mixes with the working medium in the vapor state to form a number of bubbles in and on the wick structure of the evaporator. The bubbles tend to block the pores of the wick structure of the evaporator and decrease a capillarity of the wick structure, to thereby retard the flow of the condensed working medium in the liquid state back into the evaporator. Thus, the amount of working medium in the liquid state contained in the wick structure of the evaporator is decreased, which may eventually result in overheating of the loop heat pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, if the wick structure of the evaporator is too thin, the working medium contained in the wick structure is liable to dry off altogether, whereupon the loop heat pipe is destroyed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">What is needed, therefore, is a loop heat pipe which can overcome the described limitations.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Reference will now be made to the drawing figures to describe the present loop heat pipe in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a loop heat pipe <b>10</b> according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure is shown. The loop heat pipe <b>10</b> includes an evaporator <b>11</b>, a condenser <b>12</b>, and a vapor line <b>13</b> and a liquid line <b>14</b> connecting the evaporator <b>11</b> and the condenser <b>12</b> to form a closed loop. A predetermined quantity of bi-phase working medium (not shown) is filled in the closed loop. The working medium is a liquid which has a relatively low boiling point, such as water, methanol, or alcohol. Thus the working medium can easily evaporate when it absorbs heat transferred to the evaporator <b>11</b> from an external heat-generating object, and easily condense to liquid when it dissipates heat to the ambient environment at the condenser <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the evaporator <b>11</b> is rectangular and has a flat shape, and includes a base <b>111</b>, a wick structure <b>20</b> received in the base <b>111</b>, and a cover plate <b>113</b> covering the base <b>111</b>. The base <b>111</b> includes a rectangular bottom plate <b>110</b>, and a side plate <b>112</b> extending up from a periphery side of the bottom plate <b>110</b>. The side plate <b>112</b> surrounding the bottom plate <b>110</b> includes a left plate, a right plate, a front plate and a rear plate respectively located on the four sides of the evaporator <b>11</b>. When in use, the bottom plate <b>110</b> of the evaporator <b>11</b> thermally connects to, e.g., a heat-generating electronic component <b>40</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to absorb the heat generated therefrom. The cover plate <b>113</b> connects to the top of the side plate <b>112</b>. The bottom plate <b>110</b>, the side plate <b>112</b> and the cover plate <b>113</b> cooperatively define a space <b>114</b> for receiving the wick structure <b>20</b> therein. The side plate <b>112</b> defines a circular liquid inlet <b>115</b> at the center of the left plate, and a circular vapor outlet <b>116</b> at the center of the right plate.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The wick structure <b>20</b> is made of sintered powder. The wick structure <b>20</b> includes a bottom wall <b>21</b>, a four-sided support wall <b>22</b> extending up from the bottom wall <b>21</b>, and a number of elongated guide walls <b>23</b> extending out from one side of the support wall <b>22</b>. The size of the bottom wall <b>21</b> is substantially equal to that of the bottom plate <b>110</b> of the base <b>11</b>. The support wall <b>22</b> is located at the left end of the bottom plate <b>110</b>, adjacent to the liquid inlet <b>115</b>. The support wall <b>22</b> includes a first wall <b>221</b>, a second wall <b>222</b> substantially parallel to and spaced apart from the first wall <b>221</b>, a third wall <b>223</b> adjoining left ends of the first and second walls <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>, and a fourth wall <b>224</b> adjoining right ends of the first and second walls <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The first wall <b>221</b> abuts against the left plate of the side plate <b>112</b>. A rectangular cutout <b>226</b> is defined at a center of the first wall <b>221</b>. The cutout <b>226</b> is aligned with the liquid inlet <b>115</b> and communicates with the liquid inlet <b>115</b>. The third and fourth walls <b>223</b>, <b>224</b> respectively abut against the front and rear plates. The second wall <b>222</b> is located between the left and right plates, with two opposite ends of the second wall <b>222</b> abutting the front and rear plates. The second wall <b>222</b> separates an interior of the evaporator <b>11</b> into a liquid chamber <b>220</b> between the left plate and the second wall <b>222</b>, and a vapor chamber <b>225</b> between the second wall <b>222</b> and the right plate, wherein the liquid chamber <b>220</b> is surrounded by the first, second, third and fourth walls <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, <b>224</b> of the support wall <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The liquid chamber <b>220</b> is located adjacent to the liquid line <b>14</b>, and communicates with the liquid line <b>14</b> through the cutout <b>226</b> and the liquid inlet <b>115</b>. A distance between the first and second walls <b>221</b>, <b>222</b> is smaller than half of the length of the bottom plate <b>110</b>. That is, a length of the liquid chamber <b>220</b> is shorter than half of the length of the evaporator <b>11</b>. In this embodiment, the length of the liquid chamber <b>220</b> is about one fifth of the length of the evaporator <b>11</b>. The height of the wick structure <b>20</b> is substantially equal to that of the side plate <b>112</b> of the base <b>11</b>. When the wick structure <b>20</b> is received in the evaporator <b>11</b>, the bottom wall <b>21</b> contacts the top surface of the bottom plate <b>110</b>, and tops of the support wall <b>22</b> and the guide walls <b>23</b> contact the bottom surface of the cover plate <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> together, the guide walls <b>23</b> are located in the vapor chamber <b>225</b> of the evaporator <b>11</b>. Each of the guide walls <b>23</b> extends out from the second wall <b>222</b> at the right plate. The guide walls <b>23</b> are substantially parallel to and equally spaced from each other along the widthwise direction of the evaporator <b>11</b>. An elongated rectangular guide channel <b>227</b> is defined between each two neighboring guide walls <b>23</b>, and between each endmost guide wall <b>23</b> and the corresponding front or rear plate of the side plate <b>112</b>. The sum of the length of the liquid chamber <b>220</b> and the group of guide walls <b>23</b> is smaller than the length of the bottom plate <b>21</b>. That is, the length of each of the guide walls <b>23</b> is smaller than that of the vapor chamber <b>225</b>. A room <b>228</b> communicating with each of the guide channels <b>227</b> is defined between distal ends of the guide walls <b>23</b> and the right plate of the side plate <b>112</b>. In this embodiment, a transverse cross-section of each guide channel <b>227</b> is rectangular.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Each of the condenser <b>12</b>, the vapor line <b>13</b> and the liquid line <b>14</b> is an elongated hollow conduit. In this embodiment, the condenser <b>12</b>, the vapor line <b>13</b> and the liquid line <b>14</b> are tubes. The condenser <b>12</b> is substantially parallel to the evaporator <b>11</b>, and includes a vapor inlet <b>121</b> connecting the vapor line <b>13</b> and a liquid outlet <b>123</b> connected to the liquid line <b>14</b>. A heat dissipation component <b>30</b> thermally contacts an outer surface of the condenser <b>12</b> to dissipate heat to the ambient environment. The heat dissipation component <b>30</b> can be a heat sink. Although not shown, the heat dissipation component <b>30</b> can be a fin-type heat sink, which include fins for increasing the heat dissipation efficiency thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">During operation of the loop heat pipe <b>10</b>, a portion of the bottom plate <b>110</b> which is right under the guide walls <b>23</b> of the base <b>111</b> functions as a heat-absorbing area <b>117</b> to make contact with the electronic component <b>40</b> and absorb heat generated therefrom. Thus, the working medium in a liquid state contained in the wick structure <b>20</b> absorbs heat from the electronic component and vaporizes to a vapor state. The vapor pressure expels the working medium in the vapor state, which carries heat with it, to flow along the guide channels <b>227</b> to the room <b>228</b>, and then flow through the vapor line <b>13</b> to the condenser <b>12</b>. The working medium in the vapor state then enters the condenser <b>12</b> through the vapor inlet <b>121</b>. At the condenser <b>12</b>, the working medium in the vapor state dissipates the heat to the ambient environment via the heat dissipation component <b>30</b> and condenses back to the liquid state. The working medium in the liquid state flows out of the liquid outlet <b>123</b> of the condenser <b>12</b>, and is propelled through the liquid line <b>14</b> and moves into the evaporator <b>11</b> through the liquid inlet <b>110</b> thereof. The working medium in the liquid state at the evaporator <b>11</b> eventually evaporates to start another heat transfer cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Due to the fact that the evaporator <b>11</b> includes the liquid chamber <b>220</b> and the vapor chamber <b>225</b>, which are separated from each other, the liquid chamber <b>220</b> can maintain enough working medium in the liquid state at all times. In addition, the working medium in the liquid state contained in the liquid chamber <b>220</b> can penetrate into the wick structure <b>20</b> by capillarity of the wick structure <b>20</b>, and thereby avoid overheating of the loop heat pipe <b>10</b>. Furthermore, the working medium in the vapor state in the vapor chamber <b>225</b> cannot flow back to the liquid chamber <b>220</b> to mix with the working medium in the liquid state. This avoids the formation of bubbles in or on the wick structure <b>20</b>, and promotes a high heat transfer efficiency of the loop heat pipe <b>10</b>. Furthermore, the liquid chamber <b>220</b> and the vapor chamber <b>225</b> are horizontally arranged side by side, which advantageously minimizes a thickness of the evaporator <b>11</b>. Moreover, the wick structure <b>20</b> connected between the bottom plate <b>110</b> and the cover plate <b>113</b> of the evaporator <b>11</b> can increase the mechanical strength (intensity) of the evaporator <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a wick structure <b>20</b><i>a </i>of a loop heat pipe according to a second embodiment. The wick structure <b>20</b><i>a </i>differs from the previous embodiment only in that the wick structure <b>20</b><i>a </i>further includes a top wall <b>24</b> located on the tops of the guide walls <b>23</b>. When the wick structure <b>20</b><i>a </i>is received in the evaporator <b>11</b>, the top wall <b>24</b> and the bottom wall <b>21</b> respectively contact the bottom surface of the cover plate <b>113</b> and the top surface of the bottom plate <b>110</b>. In this embodiment, a portion of the top wall <b>24</b>, which is right above the guide walls <b>23</b>, can also function as a heating-absorbing area to make thermal contact with an electronic component and absorb heat generated therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a wick structure <b>20</b><i>b </i>of a loop heat pipe according to a third embodiment. The wick structure <b>20</b><i>b </i>differs from the second embodiment mainly in that a transverse cross-section of each of guide channels <b>227</b><i>b </i>is circular. Another difference between the loop heat pipe of the third embodiment and the loop heat pipe of the second embodiment is that in the loop heat pipe of the third embodiment, there are no guide channels <b>227</b><i>b </i>defined between opposite lengthwise sides of the wick structure <b>20</b><i>b </i>and the corresponding front and rear plates of the side plate <b>112</b>.</p>
