<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A gaming system includes a plurality of linked gaming machines, each gaming machine including a display for displaying a plurality of symbols that indicates a randomly selected outcome of a wagering game. The randomly selected outcome is selected from a plurality of outcomes in response to a wager input. Each gaming machine allows a player to achieve a player level from a plurality of player levels. The gaming system further includes a controller linked to the gaming machines. The controller is adapted to permit a certain community-event game from a plurality of community-game events to be played at two or more of gaming machines in response to a conditional state at the gaming machines. The conditional state is a function of the player levels at the gaming machines.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to gaming machines and methods for playing wagering games, and more particularly, to a wagering game that allows a player to accumulate game assets that affect other players.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Gaming machines, such as slot machines, video poker machines and the like, have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Generally, the popularity of such machines with players is dependent on the likelihood (or perceived likelihood) of winning money at the machine and the intrinsic entertainment value of the machine relative to other available gaming options. Where the available gaming options include a number of competing machines and the expectation of winning at each machine is roughly the same (or believed to be the same), players are likely to be attracted to the most entertaining and exciting machines. Shrewd operators consequently strive to employ the most entertaining and exciting machines, features, and enhancements available because such machines attract frequent play and hence increase profitability to the operator. Therefore, there is a continuing need for gaming machine manufacturers to continuously develop new games and improved gaming enhancements that will attract frequent play through enhanced entertainment value to the player.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One concept that has been successfully employed to enhance the entertainment value of a game is the concept of a &#x201c;secondary&#x201d; or &#x201c;bonus&#x201d; game that may be played in conjunction with a &#x201c;basic&#x201d; game. The bonus game may comprise any type of game, either similar to or completely different from the basic game, which is entered upon the occurrence of a selected event or outcome in the basic game. Generally, bonus games provide a greater expectation of winning than the basic game and may also be accompanied with more attractive or unusual video displays and/or audio. Bonus games may additionally award players with &#x201c;progressive jackpot&#x201d; awards that are funded, at least in part, by a percentage of coin-in from the gaming machine or a plurality of participating gaming machines. Because the bonus game concept offers tremendous advantages in player appeal and excitement relative to other known games, and because such games are attractive to both players and operators, there is a continuing need to develop gaming machines with new types of bonus games to satisfy the demands of players and operators.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A player begins play of the basic wagering game by making a wager via the value input device <b>18</b> of the gaming machine <b>10</b>. A player can select play by using the player input device <b>24</b>, via the buttons <b>26</b> or the touch screen keys <b>30</b>. The basic game consists of a plurality of symbols arranged in an array, and includes at least one payline <b>32</b> that indicates one or more outcomes of the basic game. Such outcomes are randomly selected in response to the wagering input by the player. At least one of the plurality of randomly selected outcomes may be a start-bonus outcome, which can include any variations of symbols or symbol combinations triggering a bonus game.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the gaming machine <b>10</b> may also include a player information reader <b>52</b> that allows for identification of a player by reading a card with information indicating his or her true identity. The player information reader <b>52</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as a card reader, but may take on many forms including a ticket reader, bar code scanner, RFID transceiver or computer readable storage medium interface. Currently, identification is generally used by casinos for rewarding certain players with complimentary services or special offers. For example, a player may be enrolled in the gaming establishment's loyalty club and may be awarded certain complimentary services as that player collects points in his or her player-tracking account. The player inserts his or her card into the player information reader <b>52</b>, which allows the casino's computers to register that player's wagering at the gaming machine <b>10</b>. The gaming machine <b>10</b> may use the secondary display <b>16</b> or other dedicated player-tracking display for providing the player with information about his or her account or other player-specific information. Also, in some embodiments, the information reader <b>52</b> may be used to restore game assets that the player achieved and saved during a previous game session.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the various components of the gaming machine <b>10</b> are controlled by a central processing unit (CPU) <b>34</b>, also referred to herein as a controller or processor (such as a microcontroller or microprocessor). To provide gaming functions, the controller <b>34</b> executes one or more game programs stored in a computer readable storage medium, in the form of memory <b>36</b>. The controller <b>34</b> performs the random selection (using a random number generator (RNG)) of an outcome from the plurality of possible outcomes of the wagering game. Alternatively, the random event may be determined at a remote controller. The remote controller may use either an RNG or pooling scheme for its central determination of a game outcome. It should be appreciated that the controller <b>34</b> may include one or more microprocessors, including but not limited to a master processor, a slave processor, and a secondary or parallel processor.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The controller <b>34</b> is also coupled to the system memory <b>36</b> and a money/credit detector <b>38</b>. The system memory <b>36</b> may comprise a volatile memory (e.g., a random-access memory (RAM)) and a non-volatile memory (e.g., an EEPROM). The system memory <b>36</b> may include multiple RAM and multiple program memories. The money/credit detector <b>38</b> signals the processor that money and/or credits have been input via the value input device <b>18</b>. Preferably, these components are located within the housing <b>12</b> of the gaming machine <b>10</b>. However, as explained above, these components may be located outboard of the housing <b>12</b> and connected to the remainder of the components of the gaming machine <b>10</b> via a variety of different wired or wireless connection methods.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the controller <b>34</b> is also connected to, and controls, the primary display <b>14</b>, the player input device <b>24</b>, and a payoff mechanism <b>40</b>. The payoff mechanism <b>40</b> is operable in response to instructions from the controller <b>34</b> to award a payoff to the player in response to certain winning outcomes that might occur in the basic game or the bonus game(s). The payoff may be provided in the form of points, bills, tickets, coupons, cards, etc. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the payoff mechanism <b>40</b> includes both a ticket printer <b>42</b> and a coin outlet <b>44</b>. However, any of a variety of payoff mechanisms <b>40</b> well known in the art may be implemented, including cards, coins, tickets, smartcards, cash, etc. The payoff amounts distributed by the payoff mechanism <b>40</b> are determined by one or more pay tables stored in the system memory <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Communications between the controller <b>34</b> and both the peripheral components of the gaming machine <b>10</b> and external systems <b>50</b> occur through input/output (I/O) circuits <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>. More specifically, the controller <b>34</b> controls and receives inputs from the peripheral components of the gaming machine <b>10</b> through the input/output circuits <b>46</b>. Further, the controller <b>34</b> communicates with the external systems <b>50</b> via the I/O circuits <b>48</b> and a communication path (e.g., serial, parallel, IR, RC, 10bT, etc.). The external systems <b>50</b> may include a gaming network, other gaming machines, a gaming server, communications hardware, or a variety of other interfaced systems or components. Although the I/O circuits <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> may be shown as a single block, it should be appreciated that each of the I/O circuits <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> may include a number of different types of I/O circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Controller <b>34</b>, as used herein, comprises any combination of hardware, software, and/or firmware that may be disposed or resident inside and/or outside of the gaming machine <b>10</b> that may communicate with and/or control the transfer of data between the gaming machine <b>10</b> and a bus, another computer, processor, or device and/or a service and/or a network. The controller <b>34</b> may comprise one or more controllers or processors. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the controller <b>34</b> in the gaming machine <b>10</b> is depicted as comprising a CPU, but the controller <b>34</b> may alternatively comprise a CPU in combination with other components, such as the I/O circuits <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> and the system memory <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, the main display <b>14</b> shows a message to a new player indicating a transfer of a stored game asset from another player. Specifically, player Dino-Dan (a recruiting player) has provided the new player with an asset, in this case a Free Spin, for use at any time after the new player has played two spins. The Free Spin provides an incentive for the new player to play the wagering game, and the requirement for playing two spins ensures that the new player wagers at least a minimum amount. The Free Spin can be saved on any storage medium, e.g., ticket, memory card, etc. An optional time and date can also be stored on the storage medium to indicate current or previous assets. In addition to the message indicating the transfer, the main display <b>14</b> optionally shows a Free Spin Counter (e.g., &#x201c;1&#x201d; spin).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>, the main display <b>14</b> shows a message to the recruiting player, Dino-Dan, confirming the transfer of the Free Spin. In exchange, player Dino-Dan has been awarded a game enhancement parameter, which in this case is a Bonus Game Enhancement, that he or she can use at any time. Thus, the Bonus Game Enhancement provides an incentive for player Dino-Dan to recruit other players. A Bonus Game Enhancement Counter indicates that player Dino-Dan currently has &#x201c;1&#x201d; Bonus Game Enhancement. The Bonus Game Enhancement may be a multiplier that is applied to the bonus game when it is achieved, or other features allowing for an increased chance of success or payout in the bonus game.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The recruiting player Dino-Dan can collect the assets over a short, finite period of time (e.g., one hour, or one day) or over an extended period of time (e.g., a year). After the assets have been collected, player Dino-Dan can transfer one or more assets in response to certain events, such as achieving a symbol combination or a random mystery event, or a certain person being the new player at an adjacent gaming machine. For example, player Dino-Dan is allowed to transfer an asset if the new player meets predetermined criteria. Optionally, the asset (e.g., the Bonus Game Enhancement) transferred to Dino-Dan can be removed if it is not used within a period of time, or if Dino-Dan has not met certain criteria such as wagering an amount over a certain period of time. This encourages continued game play.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Other types of game-enhancement parameters can be awarded to, or selected by, the recruiting player (e.g., Dino Dan). Examples include the &#x201c;RANDOM MULTIPLIER,&#x201d; &#x201c;AUTOMATIC NUDGE&#x201d;, &#x201c;UPGRADE&#x201d;, &#x201c;DIFFERENT PAY TABLE&#x201d;, &#x201c;EXTRA WILD&#x201d;. &#x201c;SCATTER&#x201d;, &#x201c;RIGHT-TO-LEFT&#x201d;, &#x201c;RE-SPIN&#x201d; &#x201c;MORPH&#x201d;, &#x201c;HOLD SYMBOL&#x201d;, and &#x201c;SYMBOL MOVEMENT&#x201d;. Different types of game-enhancement parameters provide the player with the opportunity to achieve a higher payout or make it easier for the player to achieve a payout or other award.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The RANDOM MULTIPLIER game-enhancement parameter multiplies a payout or other outcome awarded to the player. The RANDOM MULTIPLIER game-enhancement parameter may take the form of an electronic pair of dice or a single die spinning on a gaming machine display.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The AUTOMATIC NUDGE game-enhancement parameter is advantageous in situations where a better payout can be achieved by moving symbols on one (or multiple) reels either up or down across a payline.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The UPGRADE game-enhancement parameter causes a winning symbol combination to move up at least one or two winning symbol combinations on the pay table for the gaming machine <b>10</b>. For example, a lower-paying combination of three &#x201c;cherry&#x201d; symbols may pay out as if the player had achieved three &#x201c;3-bars&#x201d; symbols, a better combination.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The DIFFERENT PAY TABLE game-enhancement parameter implements a different and higher-paying pay table, awarding larger payouts for various symbol combinations. For example, if a combination of three &#x201c;cherry&#x201d; symbols normally pays out 200% of the original wager, the DIFFERENT PAY TABLE game-enhancement parameter may result in a payout of 300% of the original wager for the combination.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The EXTRA WILD game-enhancement parameter causes a symbol that is normally a regular symbol, such as a &#x201c;cherry&#x201d; symbol or a &#x201c;1-bar&#x201d; symbol, to become a wild symbol.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The SCATTER game-enhancement parameter converts a single-line pay into a scatter payout, such that a winning combination of symbols need not be located all on a single active payline.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The RIGHT-TO-LEFT game-enhancement parameter allows &#x201c;right-to-left&#x201d; combinations (i.e., combinations starting on the right-most reel and extending left across the reels) to win, in addition to the standard winning &#x201c;left-to-right&#x201d; combinations.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the event that the player does not achieve a high-paying winning combination, the RE-SPIN game-enhancement parameter re-spins one or more of the reels, giving the player an additional chance to get a high-paying winning combination.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The MORPH game-enhancement parameter allows one or more symbols on the reels to morph into other symbols that are more beneficial.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The HOLD SYMBOL game-enhancement parameter holds a symbol in a certain location on one of the reels so that a final symbol combination across the reels must take into account the held symbol.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The SYMBOL MOVEMENT game-enhancement parameter allows symbols to move to others location along a payline if it would result in a better outcome (e.g., a higher payout).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The game-enhancement parameters discussed above are merely examples of what can be awarded in response to a transfer from the recruiting player, and it should be appreciated that this list is not exhaustive. In practice, additional types of game-enhancement parameters may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>illustrate another embodiment in which a player's accumulated assets have an effect on other players. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>, the assets of a player or players have an effect on the payback percentage of the four linked gaming machines (GM<b>1</b>, GM<b>2</b>, GM<b>3</b>, GM<b>4</b>). In this case, the players' accumulated assets result in the player achieving a certain player status, or player level. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>is a graph illustrating the payback percentage at each gaming machine in a bank at an initial time. The payback percentage of each gaming machine is based on at least two criteria: (i) the player level of a respective player playing the gaming machine; and (ii) the player level of other players playing any of the other three linked gaming machines. Accordingly, the payback percentage of each gaming machine is dependent not only on the player level of the corresponding player but also on the player level of the other players on the bank of gaming machines. For example, the payback percentage at gaming machine <b>1</b> (GM<b>1</b>) is dependent on both the player level of the current player playing GM<b>1</b> and the player level of each of the three players playing at gaming machine <b>2</b> (GM<b>2</b>), gaming machine <b>3</b> (GM<b>3</b>), and gaming machine <b>4</b> (GM<b>4</b>). As shown, the payback percentage at gaming machines <b>1</b>-<b>4</b> (GM<b>1</b>-GM<b>4</b>) is 91%, 93%, 92%, and 94%, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The player level is based on criteria occurring at corresponding gaming machines. For example, the criteria can be the receiving of a certain combination of symbols in the wagering game or the achieving of a certain event. The criteria can also be based on a function of the wager inputs from the player. For example, an increased wager input rate over a period of time or number of plays may result in a higher player level. Player levels can also be a function of winnings, elapsed time from last wager, number of wagering sessions, and number of wagering games. In summary, player levels can fluctuate during the game such that the payback percentage at each gaming machine fluctuates as well.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>, the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>now illustrates the payback percentage at the bank of four gaming machines at a subsequent time. The initial player playing GM<b>3</b> has left and a new player has joined the bank of gaming machines. Because the new player has a higher player level than the initial player, the payback percentage at each gaming machine is increased. For example, the payback percentage at each of GM<b>1</b>, GM<b>2</b>, and GM<b>4</b> has increased by 1% (i.e., 92%, 94%, and 95%, respectively). Thus, the players of GM<b>1</b>, GM<b>2</b>, and GM<b>4</b> have benefited from having the new player with a higher player level (i.e., higher or more assets) join the bank. Had the new player had a lower player level than the initial player, the players of GM<b>1</b>, GM<b>2</b>, and GM<b>4</b> would have had a decreased payback percentage.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The payback percentage is optionally displayed in real time on one or more displays of the gaming machines GM<b>1</b>, GM<b>2</b>, GM<b>3</b>, and GM<b>4</b>. For example, the players may have a feeling of excitement when the graph (or other form of communicating the payback percentage) moves upward as player levels increase or a &#x201c;high-roller&#x201d; player begins play at one of the gaming machines GM<b>1</b>, GM<b>2</b>, GM<b>3</b>, and GM<b>4</b>, increasing the payback percentage at each gaming machine.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-13</figref> illustrate other embodiments where the assets of a player may have an effect on the game play at other gaming machines. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-13</figref> will be described with respect to a Star Trek&#x2122; theme. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a help screen on the main display <b>14</b> indicates the number of savable assets that are needed to achieve various player levels that are indicated by characters in a Star-Trek&#x2122; themed wagering game. As discussed above, the assets that result in the various player levels can be based on the player receiving a predetermined combination of symbols, achieving a certain event, or having a certain wager-input rate.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The player generally begins with no assets and attempts to work himself or herself up to a first level (Chief Officer) with the hope of increasing to the highest available level (Captain). For each level the player accumulates a predetermined number of assets. As shown, the requirement for the Chief Officer level is five assets and the requirement for the Captain level is twenty assets. As the player level increases, additional options become available to the player and to other players in the bank as discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a help screen on the main display <b>14</b> indicates a series of community bonus games that are accessible on the bank of gaming machines based on the level of players who are playing at the bank of gaming machines. For example, the exemplary bonus games are separated into four sets of community bonus games: Vulcan Bonus Games, Romulan Bonus Games, Andorrian Bonus Games, and Archon Bonus Games. Each set of bonus games includes three games, e.g., the Vulcan Bonus Games includes three games (Vulcan Logic Match, Vulcan Greeting, and Spock Landing).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">To play a specific set of community bonus games, a conditional state related to the player levels is required at the bank of gaming machines. For example, when considering the player levels of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the bank requirement for playing the Vulcan Bonus Games in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is to have at least one player having a First Officer level, at least one player having a Science Officer level, and at least one player having a Chief Officer level. Optionally, players of higher levels qualify for lower level requirements. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a player having a Captain level meets the requirement necessary for a First Officer level.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a bank of gaming machines <b>10</b><i>a</i>-<b>10</b><i>d </i>is coupled to a bank display <b>60</b>, which indicates community bonus games that are available to the players. In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the Archon Bonus (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) has been enabled and the bank players may play one of the Tractor Beam Hold game, the Landru's Revenge game, and the Save the Day game. The community bonus games are enabled in response to a conditional state at the bank of gaming machines <b>10</b><i>a</i>-<b>10</b><i>d</i>, wherein the conditional state is a function of player levels specified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-6</figref>. For example, the Archon Bonus community bonus games depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are enabled because there are four players playing on the bank that meet the minimum player level requirements of Captain, First Office, Science Officer, and Medical Officer.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As such, in response to a community-game triggering event (e.g., a certain symbol combination at one of the gaming machines, or a random &#x201c;mystery&#x201d; trigger independent of the outcomes at the gaming machines), the four players at the gaming machines are eligible to play one or more of the Archon Bonus community bonus games. Eligibility to participate in the community game can be determined using a few methods. In one method, the eligibility is provided to all players within a finite group of machines (e.g., a bank of four, five, or six machines) if any of the players on those machines meets a certain criteria to be eligible for the community event. Thus, while it may be that the levels of only three players met the criteria for creating eligibility for a certain community game event, when the community event is triggered, all players in the group will participate in the community event. Or, it may be that three players who met the criteria for making a certain community game event eligible for the machine, and the one player who triggered the community event will participate in the community event, leaving a few players out of the community event.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">It should be noted that the players can continue to accumulate assets while playing the Archon community bonus games, leading to higher player levels and, possibly, eligibility to other games. Further, the player levels could decrease, removing eligibility to the Archon community bonus games. If the player leaves, the player's level can be stored to a storage medium for game play during subsequent wagering sessions (i.e., after the player has cashed out during a first wagering session and has returned for a second wagering session). In this way, a player with a certain level may seek out a bank of machines where his or her player level will &#x201c;mesh&#x201d; well with the levels of the players at the new bank to produce eligibility to a group of games the player finds desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In a further embodiment, the player can change and/or customize a game theme associated with the bonus games (also referred to as community-game events) played on the bank of gaming machines <b>10</b><i>a</i>-<b>10</b><i>d</i>. The changes may correspond to the theme of the player's level achieved. For example, if the player achieves the Medical Officer level, the basic wagering game can include symbols related to medicine. The underlying game may be the same, but the symbols used to indicate game outcomes may change, as well as the background symbols and art.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the main display <b>14</b> illustrates the conditional state of a player's level fluctuating with respect to time, providing a player with a history of his or her player level. As a player plays a wagering game on a bank of gaming machines, the player's level may fluctuate based on certain criteria that occurs at the corresponding gaming machine. For example, the player's level may fluctuate based on criteria described above in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The player level is illustrated with four bars, a first bar <b>62</b>, a second bar <b>64</b>, a third bar <b>66</b>, and a fourth bar <b>68</b>, each bar indicating increments of &#x201c;5&#x201d; units (e.g., assets, credits, etc.). Further, each bar represents a specific period of time. Assuming that the player level is based on wager input rate and is measured in assets, the first bar <b>62</b> indicates that the player's wager input rate provides twenty-one (21) assets during a first time period. During a second time period, as indicated by the second bar <b>64</b>, the wager input rate of the player has decreased and, accordingly, the player level has decreased to about twelve (12) assets. During a third period of time the wager input rate of the player has increased slightly to provide about sixteen (16) assets, shown in the third bar <b>66</b>, and during a fourth period of time the wager input rate has decreased to provide about seven (7) assets, shown in the fourth bar <b>66</b>. Thus, referring to the player levels illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, over the course of four periods of time the player level has changed from Captain (&#x201c;20&#x201d; asset requirement), to Science Officer (&#x201c;12&#x201d; asset requirement), to First Officer (&#x201c;15&#x201d; asset requirement), and, lastly, to Chief Officer (&#x201c;5&#x201d; asset requirement). The skilled artisan would contemplate several ways of illustrating the player level over a period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Alternatively, the four bars <b>62</b>-<b>68</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> show the player level for each player of four gaming machines. For example, the first bar <b>62</b> indicates that the player level of a player at a first gaming machine has about twenty-one (21) assets, the second bar <b>64</b> indicates that the player level of a player at a second gaming machine has about twelve (12) assets, and so on. In summary, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrate that displaying a player's level or a group of players' levels provides helpful information to the player or players.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Based on the current player level of each player, the players may select a community-game event using a weighted average of the player levels as explained in more detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Alternatively, the player with the highest ranked player level is allowed to select the community-game event.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The fluctuations in player level can be displayed individually to the player in real time. Alternatively, a weighted average of the player levels of all the players on the bank of gaming machines is displayed. Thus, when a higher ranked player joins the bank everyone will tend to get more excited because the weighted average of the player levels will increase, opening new opportunities for all the players (e.g., enabling previously unavailable bonus games).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Optionally, a player is warned before his or her player level is decreased. For example, a message may notify the player that unless he or she performs a certain action the player level will be decreased. The player may make a selection, increase the player level, achieve a certain outcome, or pay a fee to prevent the decrease in the player level.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates an additional embodiment in which assets are transferred between players to achieve a certain player level for the bank of gaming machines, thereby achieving a positive result for the entire group. Specifically, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the bank display <b>60</b> of the bank of gaming machines <b>10</b><i>a</i>-<b>10</b><i>d </i>indicates that assets have been transferred between two players. In the illustrated scenario, the first player has eighteen (18) accumulated assets, the second player has ten (10) accumulated assets, the third player (on the third gaming machine <b>10</b><i>c</i>) has three (3) assets, and the fourth player (on the fourth gaming machine <b>10</b><i>d</i>) has five (5) assets. To enable the Vulcan Bonus games, the players must meet the requirements of having at least a First Officer level of &#x201c;15&#x201d; assets, a Science Officer level of &#x201c;12&#x201d; assets, and a Chief Officer level of &#x201c;5&#x201d; assets.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The first player meets the First Officer level, wherein &#x201c;18&#x201d; assets are greater than the required &#x201c;15&#x201d; assets. The fourth player meets the Chief Officer level, wherein &#x201c;5&#x201d; assets is the minimum required for this level. The only requirement that is not met by the players is the Science Officer level. To meet this requirement, the first player transfers &#x201c;2&#x201d; assets to the second player to obtain the level of Science Officer. After the transfer, the first player has the rank of First Officer (&#x201c;18&#x201d;&#x2212;&#x201c;2&#x201d;=&#x201c;16&#x201d; assets), the second player has a modified level&#x2014;the rank of Science Officer (&#x201c;10&#x201d;+&#x201c;2&#x201d;=&#x201c;12&#x201d; assets), and the fourth player has the rank of Chief Officer. Accordingly, based on the transfer of assets, the players are allowed to play the Vulcan Bonus games.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In alternative embodiments, the transfer of assets is permitted only if a community-event triggering event occurs. For example, the second player may be required to achieve a predetermined outcome before he or she is allowed to receive the &#x201c;2&#x201d; assets. Optionally, the transferring player (e.g., the first player) may receive an award for transferring the assets to the receiving player (e.g., the second player), as discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Information associated with the players can be displayed on any display of the gaming machines <b>10</b><i>a</i>-<b>10</b><i>d </i>or the bank display <b>60</b>. For example, the players' names, levels, and gaming machines can be displayed individually or collectively. In other words, each player may be able to view his or her own individual data or data associated with any other player on the bank. Thus, if the first player is aware that the second player needs two assets for the group of players to access the Vulcan Bonus games, the first player may send the assets to the second player before the second player requests them. Each player is encouraged to improve the game-play of the entire group of players on the bank of gaming machines <b>10</b><i>a</i>-<b>10</b><i>d</i>. The information can be displayed locally on each gaming machine and/or on the bank display <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The bank of gaming machines <b>10</b><i>a</i>-<b>10</b><i>d </i>may, alternatively, suggest to the players which bonus games have not been played and how to enable those games. Thus, the players may receive automatic messages notifying them which assets may be transferred to enable specific bonus games. As such, the community game event would rely on the system to determine which players have played which community events (e.g., via use of player tracking cards), allowing for the automatic messages to be played. Further, the system operating the community event may provide statistics to show which community events have been played by percentage, to allow players to understand that an asset transfer may provide access to a very rare community event if the community event trigger is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">If the minimum requirements are met for playing one or more community games, one or more of the players may be given the option to select a specific bonus game. For example, the player with the highest rank level (e.g., the first player) may be allowed to make the decision as to what bonus game should be played. Alternatively, the decision may be made by all the players on the bank using a weighted system (described in more detail below in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates one type of community event that includes several players taking turns with picks to achieve a &#x201c;match&#x201d;. The Vulcan Greeting game (which is Game #2 of the Vulcan Bonus games of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) has been selected by the player, players or the computer after a community-event trigger has been achieved by one or more of the players while the Vulcan Bonus Games are enabled. The Vulcan Greeting is typically displayed to the players on the bank of gaming machines <b>10</b><i>a</i>-<b>10</b><i>d </i>via the community display <b>60</b>. Here, the players are shown a plurality of selectable symbols which, after selection, reveal a symbol. Because two like symbols (&#x201c;Phaser Guns&#x201d;) have been found, the eligible players will be provided with at least one award.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the main display <b>14</b> shows a weighted system in which the players select the community bonus games referred to in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Each player on the bank selects one of the games from the list of Vulcan Bonus games, which are enabled. The first player (having &#x201c;16&#x201d; assets) selects the Spock Landing game, the second player (having &#x201c;12&#x201d; assets) selects the Vulcan Greeting game, the third player (having &#x201c;3&#x201d; assets) selects the Vulcan Logic Match game, and the fourth player (having &#x201c;5&#x201d; assets) selects the Vulcan Greeting game. The game selected by players having the greatest number of total combined assets is played. Thus, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the Vulcan Greeting game is played because it is selected by two players whose total combined assets are &#x201c;17&#x201d; (&#x201c;12&#x201d;+&#x201c;5&#x201d;). Although the first player has the greatest number of assets, his or her number of &#x201c;16&#x201d; assets is lower than the total combined assets of the second player and the third player. The player selection regarding which community bonus game to play may be conducted after the triggering of the community event by one or more of the players, or before the triggering occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In alternative embodiments, the player with the highest number of assets decides which game to play on the bank. In the above the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, if this rule was used, the first player would make the decision to play the Spock Landing game because he or she has &#x201c;16&#x201d; assets.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is an alternative embodiment whereby a collection of different assets is required for an award, or eligibility to achieve an award. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the main display <b>14</b> includes a list of assets that must be collected to access bonus games, community bonus games, or to unlock other game enhancement parameters. The list of assets includes a Starship asset <b>70</b>, a Phaser Gun asset <b>72</b>, and a Spock asset <b>74</b>. If a player collects all three assets he or she receives a free spin for playing a progressive game.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">With respect to community events, a certain community event may be triggered when a predetermined number of players have achieved all three assets. Thus, players may collect more than one of a certain asset, and use that to trade other players for a different asset. Thus, the chances of the entire group achieving the community event are increased via the asset transfers.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates a trade of assets between players on the bank of gaming machines <b>10</b><i>a</i>-<b>10</b><i>b</i>. As players on the bank collect various assets, they will realize they are missing one or more items to enable certain community bonus games or unlock certain game enhancement parameters. In addition, a player may collect two or more identical assets, such as two Starship assets <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">A trade of assets between players helps one or more players to achieve a desired goal. For example, it is assumed that the first player has a collection of assets that includes two Starship assets <b>70</b> and a Spock asset <b>74</b>, and that the second player has a collection of assets that includes two Gun assets <b>72</b> and a Spock asset <b>74</b>. If the first player trades one of its Starship assets <b>70</b> for one of the second player's Gun assets <b>72</b>, both the first player and the second player will have a full collection of assets for playing a free spin of the progressive game.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The players can trade additional assets during the transfer. For example, assuming that the Gun asset <b>72</b> is more valuable than the Starship asset <b>70</b>, the second player may request the Spock asset <b>74</b> in addition to the Starship asset <b>70</b> for the Gun asset <b>72</b>. Optionally, the players that trade assets receive a special award to encourage future transfers. The transfers may occur at any time or only when specific events occur. For example, the players may only be able to transfer assets if an asset-transfer triggering event occurs during the game.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Other ways of trading assets can be made available to the players. For example, a player may charge a fee for a particular asset (e.g., the second player may ask for ten credits in return for the Gun asset <b>72</b>). In another example, the players can auction assets to other players such that the highest bidder obtains the auctioned asset. The bidders may be able to bid other assets, credits, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the bank of gaming machines <b>10</b><i>a</i>-<b>10</b><i>d </i>shows a balloon-themed game in which players collect and release balloons into the community bank display <b>60</b>. As the players collect balloons (which represent collected assets), they may have the opportunity to release them into the bank display <b>60</b> to possibly receive a bonus. If the cumulative value of released balloons meets a predetermined number, e.g., forty balloons, the players share a community bonus. Thus, each player has an incentive to collect and release as many balloons as possible. Further, each player is hoping that the other players are collecting and releasing as many balloons as possible. The collection of balloons may be a function of a &#x201c;collect balloons&#x201d; symbol combination achieved on the wagering game. The release of balloons may be a function of a certain &#x201c;release&#x201d; symbol combination achieved on the wagering game.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As shown, the players have released collectively thirty-eight balloons. The balloons released by each player float in the bank display <b>60</b> generally in an area proximate the general area of the corresponding gaming machine. If the players collectively release two more balloons they will share the community bonus. As such, since the players each have at least two collected balloons <b>80</b><i>a</i>, <b>80</b><i>b</i>, <b>80</b><i>c</i>, <b>80</b><i>d </i>at their respective gaming machines <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b</i>, <b>10</b><i>c</i>, <b>10</b><i>d </i>that can be released, if any of them achieve a &#x201c;release&#x201d; outcome, at least forty balloons will be located in the bank display <b>60</b>, achieving a community event outcome for the entire bank of machines.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">A player with lots of assets, such as the fourth player at the fourth gaming machine <b>10</b><i>d</i>, may be a &#x201c;hot&#x201d; player since he or she is able to collect and release more balloons than other players. Thus, the players on the bank are always more excited when a &#x201c;hot&#x201d; player joins the game. The new player's assets are added to the cumulative value of assets displayed in the bank display <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The wagering game may also have an unfavorable outcome, resulting in a loss of the assets by a player. For example, an unfavorable outcome has been selected for the first player, as indicated by the exploding balloons in the first gaming machine <b>10</b><i>a</i>. Consequently, the first player loses the two collected balloons, which have not been released yet. Thus, one unfavorable outcome achieved by the first player may affect only the first player, but not the community of assets.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows other possible outcomes affecting the community of assets. First, the first player has received another unfavorable outcome (&#x201c;Bad Wind&#x201d;), causing the three balloons that the player has contributed to the community of assets to &#x201c;blow&#x201d; out of the bank display <b>60</b>. And second, the second player at machine <b>10</b><i>b </i>has received a &#x201c;release&#x201d; outcome, which releases the collected five balloons to the bank display <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The unfavorable outcome resulted in reducing the cumulative value of balloons from thirty-eight to thirty-five, wherein three balloons have &#x201c;blown away&#x201d; due to the bad wind. Nevertheless, the bonus requirement of forty balloons is achieved because five additional balloons have been released by the second player due to the release outcome. If the forty balloons results in a community payout, the community payout is distributed equally among the four players or based on each of the four player's contribution.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">All of the collected assets described thus far can be stored in a memory device at a location associated with the player. Alternatively, the assets can be stored on tickets or smart cards carried by the player. These assets can be used by the player at a later gaming session, if desired. Thus, the assets (e.g., Star Trek player level, balloons, etc.) can be accumulated while the player is attempting to assist a first group of players, but saved for a later time, and used with respect to a second group of players to achieve a community event.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In alternative embodiments, a player can use a telephone to access and use one or more of the player's accumulated game assets to attempt to assist a group of players to achieve a community event. For example, using a mobile phone, the player can dial a toll-free phone number to access his or her game assets. A central server associated with the network <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) can recognize the player's mobile number for identification purposes, via a caller-id feature, or, alternatively, the central server may require the player to create a unique code number (if, for example, the player uses a caller-id block feature). Optionally, the player may be required to enter an additional code for identifying a specific gaming machine <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Thus, the player can use his or her mobile phone to remotely access the wagering game and utilize the accumulated assets at a time and place according to the player's desire. For example, the player can restart a gaming session via the mobile phone at a point where he or she had previously stopped the session, or the player can choose, via the mobile phone, to play an accumulated bonus game that he or she had previously won, but not played.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In another example, the player can put money into a gaming machine <b>10</b> while the player is physically at the gaming machine <b>10</b>. Before the player walks away from the gaming machine <b>10</b>, the player can register the gaming machine <b>10</b> to the player's phone. The player can also let the gaming machine <b>10</b> know what assets it may intend to use in the future via remote access by the phone. For example, the player can register the phone number as a password required to access the player's assets on the gaming machine <b>10</b>. The player can initiate an auto-play feature while at the gaming machine <b>10</b> or remotely via the phone. The auto-play feature of the gaming machine <b>10</b> is configured to report, e.g., via still or moving images on the phone, one or more of the gaming outcomes. Then, at a later time, the player returns to the gaming machine <b>10</b>, re-checks into the gaming machine via the phone and, optionally, cashes out any winnings. While no actual game-play occurs on the phone, the phone is used for accessing the player's assets and gaming outcomes on the gaming machine <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Optionally, the wagering game provides the player with access to accumulated assets and/or certain awards only if the player achieves a &#x201c;Remote Play Winning Outcome&#x201d;. If the player achieves this outcome (e.g., in a basic or bonus game), then he or she is allowed remote access to one or more of the accumulated assets and/or certain awards. For example, if the player achieves the &#x201c;Remote Play Winning Outcome&#x201d;, the player can have the option to select a smaller award while the player is physically present at the gaming machine <b>10</b> or a larger award if the player uses the telephone. In another example, the player may be given the option to play for smaller awards while the player is physically present at the gaming machine <b>10</b> or for larger awards if the player uses the telephone for game-play initiation.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Alternative to using a voice telephone call to initiate a game or to access assets and/or awards, as described above, the player can send a text message. For example, the player can send a special code in the text message to log-in using a special number on the gaming machine <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">For identification purposes, various verification ways can be used. For example, the player can enter the mobile telephone number into the gaming machine <b>10</b> as a player identification number. When the phone is near, the gaming machine <b>10</b> can detect it and verify the player identification number, e.g., the mobile number. For example, a receiver can be installed in the gaming machine <b>10</b> for detecting a mobile identifier (which may include the mobile number) that is periodically transmitted by mobile phones to the nearest mobile base station. Thus, the gaming machine <b>10</b> would have similar capabilities to the mobile base station.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Alternatively, the gaming machine <b>10</b> can send a voice or text message to the mobile telephone to verify the player's identification number. For example, the gaming machine <b>10</b> can send a text message asking the player to reply to the text message using a predetermined code for confirmation purposes. Optionally, a Bluetooth identifier can be used for logging-in and/or verification purposes, wherein the Bluetooth identifier is unique per phone and/or service carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Special benefits can be offered to a player based on the telephone brand and/or service carrier. For example, predetermined assets can be made available to the player only if they use a telephone of brand X that uses service carrier Y. Optionally, the special benefits can be made available based on the telephone model.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">While the present invention has been described with reference to one or more particular embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that many changes may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Each of these embodiments and obvious variations thereof is contemplated as falling within the spirit and scope of the claimed invention, which is set forth in the following claims.</p>
