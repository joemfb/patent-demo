<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A multilayer printed wiring board includes one or more resin layers having via-holes and a core layer having via-holes. The via-holes formed in the one or more resin layers are open in the direction opposite to the direction in which the via-holes formed in the core layer are open. A method for manufacturing a multilayer printed wiring board includes a step of preparing a single- or double-sided copper-clad laminate; a step of forming lands by processing the copper-clad laminate; a step of forming a resin layer on the upper surface of the copper-clad laminate, forming openings for via-holes in the resin layer, and then forming the via-holes; and a step of forming openings for via-holes in the lower surface of the copper-clad laminate and then forming the via-holes.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In order to avoid repetition, the same components shown in the accompanying drawings shall have the same reference numerals.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a multilayer printed wiring board <b>20</b> according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The multilayer printed wiring board <b>20</b> of the first embodiment includes a first resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, first via-holes <b>33</b>-<b>1</b> formed in the first resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, a second resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> disposed on the upper surface of the first resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, second via-holes <b>33</b>-<b>2</b> formed in the second resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>2</b>, a core layer <b>22</b> disposed on the lower surface of the first resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, and third via-holes <b>42</b> formed in the core layer <b>22</b>. The first and second via-holes <b>33</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>33</b>-<b>2</b> are open in the direction opposite to the direction in which the third via-holes <b>42</b> are open.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The first and second via-holes <b>33</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>33</b>-<b>2</b> may broaden upward and may taper downward. In contrast, the third via-holes <b>42</b> may taper upward and may broaden downward.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The core layer <b>22</b>, which is located lowermost, is preferably made of fiber-reinforced plastics (FRP). The core layer <b>22</b> is more preferably prepared from a copper-clad laminate such as a glass cloth base epoxy resin impregnated double-sided copper clad laminate.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The multilayer printed wiring board <b>20</b> of the first embodiment includes the first and second resin layers <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The multilayer printed wiring board <b>20</b> of the first embodiment is not limited to such a configuration and may include one or more resin layers disposed on the upper surface of the core layer <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">(1) Since the first and second via-holes <b>33</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>33</b>-<b>2</b> are open in the direction opposite to the direction in which the third via-holes <b>42</b> are open, the first and second resin layers <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> are warped in the direction opposite to the direction in which the core layer <b>22</b> are warped; hence, the multilayer printed wiring board <b>20</b> of the first embodiment is hardly warped.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Since the multilayer printed wiring board <b>20</b> of the first embodiment is hardly warped by heating during the reflow of solder bumps, the distance between the multilayer printed wiring board <b>20</b> of the first embodiment and each semiconductor element is maintained substantially constant. Therefore, even if the multilayer printed wiring board <b>20</b> of the first embodiment has a semiconductor element-mounting region (that is, a region having pads connected to electrodes of the semiconductor elements) having a large area of 200 to 2,000 mm<sup>2 </sup>and the number of the pads is 2,000 to 30,000, problems such as misconnections hardly occur.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">(2) Since the core layer <b>22</b> typically includes the glass-based material, the core layer <b>22</b> has a smaller thermal expansion coefficient and a higher dimensional stability as compared to a layer made of only resin, for example, an epoxy resin. If semiconductor elements (not shown) are mounted on the second resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>2</b>, the semiconductor elements, the second resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>2</b>, the first resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>, and the core layer <b>22</b> are arranged in that order. That is, the first and second resin layers <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> are sandwiched between the core layer <b>22</b> and the semiconductor elements having a thermal expansion coefficient which is less than those of the first and second resin layers <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>2</b>. Therefore, the multilayer printed wiring board <b>20</b> of the first embodiment may reduce the occurrence of cracks during a temperature cycle test because the multilayer printed wiring board <b>20</b> is hardly warped.
<br/>
(3) The core layer <b>22</b> is preferably prepared from the copper-clad laminate and uses the copper foils <b>23</b> as described above. For example, the core layer <b>22</b> is typically of a glass-cloth base epoxy-resin impregnated copper-clad laminate. When a copper-clad laminate is in general manufactured by a laminate maker, a surface of each copper foil <b>23</b> facing to a laminate <b>22</b> is usually matte-finished (roughened) such that the copper foil <b>23</b> is securely fixed to the copper-clad laminate <b>22</b>. The microscopic observation of the copper foil <b>23</b> shows that the copper foil <b>23</b> has protrusions (anchors) <b>27</b> extending into the copper-clad laminate <b>22</b> as shown in the circles in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This allows the copper foil <b>23</b> to be tightly fixed to the copper-clad laminate <b>22</b>.
</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">That is, the adhesion between the copper foil <b>23</b> and the copper-clad laminate <b>22</b> is very strong. Hence, the multilayer printed wiring board <b>20</b> of the first embodiment is tough.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">(4) The core layer <b>22</b> is preferably prepared from a glass cloth base epoxy-resin impregnated copper-clad laminate. The glass cloth base includes a plurality of sheets of woven glass fabric (not shown) with high dimensional stability against heat. Since the multilayer printed wiring board <b>20</b> of the first embodiment has the sheets of woven glass fabric, therefore it has high stiffness and is hardly warped.
<br/>
(Method for Manufacturing)
</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A method for manufacturing the multilayer printed wiring board <b>20</b> of the first embodiment will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2R</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a double-sided copper-clad laminate (for example, NEMA grade FR-4) <b>21</b> is prepared as starting material. The copper-clad laminate <b>22</b> for a core layer is preferably formed in such a manner that one sheet or two sheets (not shown) of woven glass fabric impregnated with a thermosetting epoxy resin is semi-cured. The copper-clad laminate <b>21</b> is then formed by cladding copper foils to both surfaces of the copper-clad laminate <b>22</b>, respectively, and then these are heat-cured. For example, a glass cloth base epoxy-resin impregnated copper-clad laminate with a thickness of about 0.06 mm, including the copper foils <b>23</b> each having a thickness of about 12 &#x3bc;m may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Alternatively, the following laminates may be used to manufacture the core layer <b>22</b>: a laminate including a glass-based material impregnated with a bismaleimide triazine resin, a laminate including a glass-based material impregnated with a polyphenylene ether resin, or a laminate including a glass-based material impregnated with a polyimide resin. The core layer <b>22</b> preferably has a thickness of 0.03 mm to 0.40 mm. The thickness of the copper-clad laminate is more preferably is from 0.03 mm to 0.12 mm. This is because the warpage of the multilayer printed wiring board <b>20</b> of the first embodiment can be reduced due to the stiffness of the core layer <b>22</b> and the counter balance between the warpage of the core layer <b>22</b> and that of the first and second resin layers <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, first etching resist layers <b>24</b> are provided on regions of the upper one of the copper foils <b>23</b>. The first etching resist layers <b>24</b> may be formed in such a manner that, for example, a dry film is laminated on the upper copper foil <b>23</b> and then partly removed to form a conductive film by photolithography. Alternatively, the first etching resist layers <b>24</b> may be formed by screen printing using a liquid resist.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, portions of the upper copper foil <b>23</b> that are exposed from the first etching resist layers <b>24</b> are removed by etching.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, the first etching resist layers <b>24</b>, disposed on the remaining portions of the upper copper foil <b>23</b>, are removed, whereby a first conductive film <b>25</b> made of the upper copper foil <b>23</b> is formed. The conductive film includes one or more of a land, a signal conductive circuit, a power conductive circuit and/or a grand conductive circuit. The via-hole is formed on the land.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, the first resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> is provided on the core layer <b>22</b>. The first resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> may be formed in such a manner that an interlayer insulating resin film (for example, a film, grade ABF, available from Ajinomoto Fine-Techno. Co. Inc), a semi-cured resin sheet such as a prepreg and the like is attached to the core layer <b>22</b> and then heat-cured, or in such a manner that pre-cured resin is applied to the core layer <b>22</b> by screen printing and then heat-cured. A thickness of the first resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> may be from 0.02 mm to 0.06 mm. The thickness of the core layer may be equal to or thicker than the thickness of the first resin layer. Before the first resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> is formed, the surfaces (including side surfaces) of the first conductive film <b>25</b> may be roughened.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, a first opening <b>26</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> for forming the first via-hole <b>33</b>-<b>1</b> is formed in the first resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> by laser irradiation using, for example, a carbon dioxide laser such that the first opening <b>26</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> is located above the respective conductive film <b>25</b> on the core layer. Since the conductive film <b>25</b> on the core layer functions as a stopper during the formation of the first opening <b>26</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> by laser irradiation, the first opening <b>26</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> reaches an upper surface of the conductive film <b>25</b> on the core layer. That is, the first via-hole <b>33</b>-<b>1</b> extends from an upper surface of the first resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> to the upper surface of the conductive film <b>25</b> on the core layer. The first opening <b>26</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> may taper toward conductive film <b>25</b> on the core layer, that is, the first opening <b>26</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> may have a downward tapered shape. Therefore, the first via-hole <b>33</b>-<b>1</b> may be, not rectangular, substantially trapezoidal in cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">An excimer laser, a YAG laser, or a UV laser may be used instead of the carbon dioxide laser. A protective film such as a PET film may be used during the formation of the first openings <b>26</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> as required. This may be applied to the formation of openings below.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>, catalyst seeds for electroless plating are provided on the first resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> having the first opening <b>26</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> and a first copper layer (an electroless plating film) <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> with a thickness of 0.6 to 3.0 &#x3bc;m is then formed on the first resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> by electroless plating. Before the first copper layer <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> is formed, the first resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> may be processed desmear as required such that resin residues are removed therefrom. Before the catalyst seeds for electroless plating, a surface of the first resin layer may be roughened.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>, a second copper layer (an electroplating film) <b>30</b>-<b>1</b> with a thickness of, for example, several ten micrometers is formed on the first copper layer <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> by electroplating using the first copper layer <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> as a feeder, that is, an electrode. Alternatively, the second copper layer <b>30</b>-<b>1</b> may be formed by electrolytic solder plating. Alternatively, the first copper layer <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> and the second copper layer <b>30</b>-<b>1</b> may be entirely formed by electroless copper plating, then the second copper layer <b>30</b>-<b>1</b> may be flattened by an appropriate process as required.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, second etching resist layers <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> are provided on the second copper layer <b>30</b>-<b>1</b>. For example, the second etching resist layers <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> may be formed by photolithography or screen printing as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2J</figref>, regions of the first and second copper layers <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>30</b>-<b>1</b> that are exposed from the second etching resist layers <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> are removed by etching.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2K</figref>, the second etching resist layers <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> on the remaining regions of the second copper layer <b>30</b>-<b>1</b> are removed, whereby a second conductive film <b>34</b>-<b>1</b> made of the first and second copper layers <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>30</b>-<b>1</b> is formed on the first resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b>. The second conductive film <b>34</b>-<b>1</b> is formed by a subtractive process as described above and may be formed by a known semi-additive process. The second conductive film includes one or more of a signal conductive circuit, a power conductive circuit, a grand conductive circuit and/or a land. In this step, the first via-hole <b>33</b>-<b>1</b> is formed such that the first conductive film <b>25</b> is electrically connected to the respective second conductive film <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>. The first via-hole may be a filled via-hole which is substantially filled the first opening with the electroplating film. The first via-hole <b>33</b>-<b>1</b> may have a cross-sectional shape corresponding to that of the first opening <b>26</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, thus it may taper toward the conductive film on the core layer, therefore the first via-hole <b>33</b>-<b>1</b> has substantially an inversed frusto-conical shape. The first via-hole has a bottom surface contacting the conductive film <b>25</b> on the core layer, and the bottom surface has a diameter which is from 40 &#x3bc;m to 150 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">At the point of time when this step is finished, the second conductive film <b>34</b>-<b>1</b> is formed on the first resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> and the first via-hole <b>33</b>-<b>1</b> is formed in the first resin layer. Therefore, a desired number of resin layers may be formed on the first resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> by repeating the steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2E to 2K</figref>. In this embodiment, these steps are repeated one more time. The second via-hole <b>33</b>-<b>2</b> has a bottom surface contacting the conductive film on the first resin layer and the bottom surface has a diameter which is from 40 &#x3bc;m to 150 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2L</figref>, the second resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> is formed on the first resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> by repeating the steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2E to 2K</figref> once. A thickness of the second resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> may be from 0.02 mm to 0.06 mm. The thickness of the second resin layer is equal to or thinner than thickness of the core layer. A second opening in the second resin layer for the second via-hole <b>33</b>-<b>2</b> may taper toward the second conductive film <b>34</b>-<b>1</b>. The second via-hole has a contacting surface contacting the second conductive film <b>34</b>-<b>1</b> on the first resin layer and having a diameter which is from 40 &#x3bc;m to 150 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2M</figref>, a third opening <b>22</b><i>a </i>for forming the third via-hole <b>42</b> is formed in the core layer <b>22</b> in such a manner that the lower one of the copper foils <b>23</b> is partly removed by photolithography and regions of the lower surface of the core layer <b>22</b> exposed are then irradiated with a laser beam. This process is so-called a conformal process. In this step, the conductive film <b>25</b> functions as stopper, hence, the third opening <b>22</b><i>a </i>reaches to the lower surface of the conductive film <b>25</b>. Therefore, the third opening <b>22</b><i>a </i>is open in the direction opposite to the direction in which the first opening <b>26</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> in the first resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> and the second opening <b>25</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> in the second resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> are open. The third opening <b>22</b><i>a </i>may taper toward the conductive film <b>25</b> on the core layer, that is, the third opening <b>22</b><i>a </i>may have an upward tapered shape.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2N</figref>, a third copper layer (an electroless plating film) <b>37</b> is formed over the remaining regions of the lower copper foil <b>23</b> and the core layer <b>22</b> having the third opening <b>22</b><i>a </i>by electroless copper plating. Before the third copper layer <b>37</b> is formed, catalyst seeds for electroless plating may be provided on the core layer <b>22</b> by, for example, sputtering or plating as required.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2P</figref>, a fourth copper layer (an electroplating film) <b>38</b> is formed on the third copper layer <b>37</b> by electroplating using the third copper layer <b>37</b> as a feeder, whereby the third via-hole <b>42</b> is formed. The third via-hole <b>42</b> is open in the direction opposite to the direction in which the first via-hole <b>33</b>-<b>1</b> and second via-hole <b>33</b>-<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2K and 2L</figref> are open. The third via-holes <b>42</b> may taper toward conductive film <b>25</b> on the core layer.

That is, the multilayer printed wiring board <b>30</b> of this embodiment includes a third resin layer (a coreless layer) <b>52</b> including no core material such as a glass cloth. The multilayer printed wiring board <b>30</b> of this embodiment further may include the first via-hole <b>33</b>-<b>1</b> and the second via-hole <b>33</b>-<b>2</b> similar to those included in the multilayer printed wiring board <b>20</b> of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The third resin layer (coreless layer) <b>52</b> has substantially the same configuration as those of the first resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> and the second resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>2</b> included in the multilayer printed wiring board <b>30</b> of this embodiment. The multilayer printed wiring board <b>30</b> of this embodiment is superior in flexibility. Hence, the multilayer printed wiring board <b>30</b> of this embodiment can readily absorb the expansion or shrinkage of a wiring board during solder reflow.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(1) The multilayer printed wiring board <b>30</b> of the second embodiment is hardly warped by heat during solder reflow; hence, a problem such as a faulty connection between a semiconductor device and a printed board hardly occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">(2) Since the multilayer printed wiring board <b>30</b> of the second embodiment is flexible and readily absorbs the expansion of such a wiring board during solder reflow. Therefore, the multilayer printed wiring board <b>30</b> of the second embodiment absorbs a difference in thermal expansion coefficient between a semiconductor element and a printed wiring board <b>30</b> of the second embodiment, hence, cracks due to such a difference are hardly formed.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The second embodiment of the invention is not limited to this configuration. The multilayer printed wiring board <b>30</b> of the second embodiment may include three or more resin layers as required.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The embodiments describe above are for exemplification and should not in any way be construed as limitative. The present invention covers modifications, variations, and substitutes readily made by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(1) The manufacturing steps described above are current typical examples. Hence, materials, manufacturing conditions, and the like used in the manufacturing steps may be varied depending on various circumstances.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">(2) In the embodiments described above, the semiconductor elements are mounted on the upper surfaces of the multilayer printed wiring boards as one example. However, the embodiment of the present invention cover multilayer printed wiring boards including semiconductor elements mounted on the lower surfaces or both surfaces thereof.

(3) The multilayer printed wiring boards <b>20</b> and <b>30</b> of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <b>3</b> each include the first and second resin layers <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>26</b>-<b>2</b>.

The adhesive is not melted or softened at a process temperature during manufacturing steps but is melted or softened at a temperature lower than a temperature at which the multilayer printed wiring board is deteriorated.
</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a multilayer printed wiring board <b>40</b> of the third embodiment has an insulating layer <b>220</b> having an opening. A conductive film <b>23</b> made of, for example Cu, Au, Ag, Ni, W, is formed on the upper surface of the insulating layer and is closing one end of the opening of the insulating layer. A resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> made of, for example, epoxy, polyimide, or a mixture made of thermosetting resin and thermoplastic resin, is formed on the insulating layer <b>220</b> and the conductive film <b>23</b> and has at least one opening. The opening in the resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> may or may not be connected to the conductive film <b>23</b>. A via-hole structure <b>42</b> is formed in the opening of the insulating layer <b>220</b> and has an electroless plating film <b>37</b> and an electroplating film <b>38</b>. The electroless plating film <b>37</b> is formed on the surface of the opening of the insulating layer and the surface of the conductive film <b>23</b>, and the electroplating film <b>38</b> is formed on the electroless plating film <b>37</b>. Another via-hole structure <b>33</b>-<b>1</b> is formed in the at least one opening of the resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> and has an electroless plating film <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> and an electroplating film <b>30</b>-<b>1</b>. The electroless plating film <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> is formed on the surface of the opening of the resin layer and the electroplating film <b>30</b>-<b>1</b> is formed on the electroless plating film <b>28</b>-<b>1</b>. The electroless plating film <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> of the via-hole structure <b>33</b>-<b>1</b> may be formed on the surface of the conductive film. Thus, on the upper surface of the conductive film, one via-hole structure having an electroless plating film and an electroplating film in this order is formed, and on the lower surface of the conductive film, the other via-hole structure having an electroless plating film and an electroplating film in this order is formed. By providing such a structure, stress due to those plating films on the multilayered printed wiring board is reduced significantly. The insulating layer <b>220</b> may be a core layer or a coreless layer. The core layer has a resin and a core material such as a glass cloth or a glass fiber, and the core layer may be a single-side or a double-side copper clad laminate. For example, the core layer may be made of a glass cloth base epoxy-resin impregnated copper-clad laminate, a glass-based material impregnated with a bismaleimide triazine resin, a laminate including a glass-based material impregnated with a polyphenylene ether resin, or a laminate including a glass-based material impregnated with a polyimide resin. The coreless layer has a resin layer without the core material. For example, the coreless layer may be made of a resin layer, such as epoxy, or polyimide, without the core layer. The multilayer printed wiring board <b>40</b> of the third embodiment may be manufactured by the steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2R</figref> without repeating the steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E to 2K</figref>. As another method, the multilayer printed wiring board <b>40</b> of the third embodiment may be manufactured by the steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4T</figref> without repeating the steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E to 4K</figref>. The via-hole structures <b>42</b>, <b>33</b>-<b>1</b> may taper toward the conductive film <b>23</b>. A thickness of the resin layer <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> may be from 0.02 mm to 0.06 mm. A thickness of the insulating layer <b>220</b> may be from 0.03 mm to 0.4 mm. The thickness of the insulating layer may be equal to or thicker than one of the resin layers. The via-hole structure <b>33</b>-<b>1</b> has a bottom surface contacting the conductive film <b>23</b> on the insulating layer and the bottom surface of the via-hole structure <b>33</b>-<b>1</b> has a diameter which may be from 40 &#x3bc;m to 150 &#x3bc;m. The via-hole structure <b>42</b> has a bottom surface contacting the conductive film <b>62</b> on the coreless layer, and the bottom surface of the via-hole structure <b>42</b> has a diameter which may be from 60 &#x3bc;m to 250 &#x3bc;m. The diameter of the bottom surface of the via-hole structure <b>42</b> may be larger than one of the bottom surface of via-hole structure <b>33</b>-<b>1</b>. The via-hole structures <b>42</b>, <b>33</b>-<b>1</b> may taper toward the conductive film <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Specifically, in the method of the first embodiment, the steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2L</figref> may be applied to each of two copper-clad laminates <b>21</b> including copper foils <b>23</b> attached to each other such that the copper foils <b>23</b> are fixed to each other with an adhesive. In the method of the second embodiment as well as the method of the first embodiment, the steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4L</figref> may be applied to each of two support plates or copper plates <b>60</b> attached to each other with an adhesive. Then, two printed boards obtained are separated from each other and separately processed in subsequent steps.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">According to this procedure, since the two copper-clad laminates <b>21</b> or support plates <b>60</b> are fixed to each other with such an adhesive, the two copper-clad laminates or support plates can be processed into the two printed boards simultaneously or successively, whereby two multilayer printed wiring boards may be manufactured at once. The two multilayer printed wiring boards fixed to each other are heated to a temperature at which the adhesive is melted or softened, whereby the two multilayer printed wiring boards are separated from each other. The resulting two multilayer printed wiring boards are then separately processed in subsequent steps.</p>
