<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a molten metal supply cylinder for melting a low melting point metallic material such as solder or indium and supplying it to a member made of glass, ceramic or metal, a molten metal supply apparatus incorporating such a supply cylinder and a molten metal supply method.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 51(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>51</b>(<i>b</i>) schematically illustrate a glass panel for forming a vacuum container or a multilayer glass panel (so-called double glass). Glass panel W includes a pair of glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> having respective main surfaces <b>51</b> and S<b>2</b> disposed oppositely with gap holding members Q (e.g., glass balls or resin balls) interposed between them so as to produce a gap of dimension g in the direction of the thickness of the panel and a bonding section n bonded to both of the main surfaces S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> at outer peripheral section (to be referred to outer peripheral gap hereinafter) k of the gap between the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> to seal the outer peripheral gap k and form an airtight chamber. The bonding section n is conventionally formed by glass frit. However, it has been proposed in recent years to form the bonding section n with a low melting point metal such as indium or solder from the viewpoint of improving the airtightness and the sealing quality including a low outgassing level. While the present invention is described below in terms of a technique of manufacturing a glass panel hereinafter, the following description by no means limits the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A glass panel for forming a vacuum container or a multilayer glass panel is manufactured by way of the following steps. (1) Preparing two rectangular glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. (2) Supplying molten metal obtained by melting a low melting point metallic material such as indium or solder to the surface to be bonded of either one of or the both glass substrates along the outer peripheral edge or edges thereof in the form of a frame to form a bonding section. (3) Aligning the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> so as to make the bonding surfaces thereof exactly face each other. (4) Putting the two glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> together and bonding them by way of the bonding section.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">PTL 1 and NPL 1 disclose techniques relating to the above step (2) of supplying molten metal. More specifically, PTL 1 discloses an apparatus for applying a molten metal sealing/bonding material (which corresponds to a low melting point metallic material in this specification) to the surfaces to be bonded of a front substrate and a rear substrate (both are glass substrates) of a vacuum container of an image display apparatus, while applying ultrasonic waves thereto, in order to form a bonding member of the metal sealing/bonding material on the surfaces to be bonded for directly or indirectly bonding the front substrate and the rear substrate. NPL 1 discloses a technique of directly bonding bodies to be bonded having oxidized surfaces such as glass substrates, using a Pb&#x2014;Sn based solder material containing one or more easily oxidizable elements selected from Zn, Al, Si, Ti and so on as bonding member, considering that such easily oxidizable elements enhance the bonding performance between a Pb&#x2014;Sn based solder material and a glass substrate, and an ultrasonic soldering technique of removing the air bubbles existing at the contact interface of molten solder and a glass substrate by applying ultrasonic vibrations to improve the bonding performance between solder and a glass substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Application of ultrasonic waves at the time when applying a molten low melting point metallic material (&#x201c;a molten low melting point metallic material&#x201d; will be referred to simply as &#x201c;a molten metal&#x201d; hereinafter in this specification unless noticed otherwise) provides an advantage of removing the air bubbles and the foreign objects existing at the surface of a glass substrate to improve the bonding performance at the bonding interface of the glass substrate and a bonding member.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Meanwhile, oxidation can proceed quickly to produce an oxide on the surface of a metal material regardless if it is in a solid phase or in a liquid phase. This phenomenon also occurs to a low melting point metallic material stored in the atmosphere in a solid phase. When the material is molten in order to form a bonding section, the oxide produced on the surface gets into the bonding interface of the bonding section and a glass substrate and/or is mixed into the molten metal material. The mixed oxide gives rise to defects at the interface of the glass substrate and the bonding section and also in the inside of the bonding section, which entail a problem of degrading the airtightness of the bonding section, the strength of the interface of the glass substrate and the bonding section and also the strength of the bonding section itself. Particularly, the above problem becomes remarkable when a bonding member is formed by utilizing ultrasonic vibrations as in the case of the techniques according to PTL 1 and NPL 1, because the oxide that is mixed into the molten metal is stirred by ultrasonic vibrations.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Exemplar techniques for dissolving the above problem are described in PTLs 2 and 3. PTL 2 discloses a configuration of disposing a pair of glass plates face to face and one above the other with a gap interposed between them and bonding the glass plates together by supplying a molten metal material that is stored in storage section with its surface held in contact with an inert gas atmosphere from the storage section to the outer peripheral gap to fill the gap for the purpose of providing a method of bonding a metal material and a glass plate, while suppressing generation of any oxide of the metal material and a method of manufacturing a glass panel that can be airtightly sealed on a stable basis by using the method.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">PTL 3 discloses a method of manufacturing an image display apparatus that can suppress generation of oxide film on the surface of a metal sealing/bonding material and improve the wettability of metal sealing/bonding material relative to the sealing/bonding surface to make it possible to realize a complete sealing/bonding effect and a sealing/bonding material filling apparatus including a support table for positioning and supporting an object to be sealed/bonded having a sealing/bonding surface, a closed storage section for storing a molten metal sealing/bonding material, a nozzle for filling the sealing/bonding surface with the molten metal sealing/bonding material fed from the storage section and a filling head having a gas supply means for supplying stabilizing gas to the front end surface and its periphery of the nozzle to establish a stable gas atmosphere there.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">PTL 4 discloses a different technique relating to the above-described step (2). PTL 4 describes a method of filling molten solder, using a metal supply cylinder having a discharge port for discharging a stored molten metal material (molten solder) and a lead-in plate for injecting molten solder into an outer peripheral gap disposed at a center section of the discharge port from the discharge port, the method including confining the gap formed between the discharge port and the corresponding end facets of a pair of glass plates to not greater than ten times the gap between the glass plates in order to reliably fill the outer peripheral gap with molten solder, suppressing any leak of molten solder if the gap between a pair of glass plates is small. PTL 4 describes that it is possible with the filling method according to the PTL 4 to fill molten solder into the outer peripheral gap, while suppressing the spread of molten solder to an unintended area if the gap of the glass plates is small.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, PTL 5 discloses a still different technique relating to the above-described step (2). PTL 5 describes a method of manufacturing a glass panel including arranging spacers between a pair of glass plates to form a gap between the glass plates, filling a single molten metal material into a peripheral section of the gap to directly bond the pair of glass plates and the metal material and airtightly sealing the gap, wherein at least a part of a plate-shaped or rod-shaped guide for guiding the molten material is inserted into an outer peripheral gap in order to supply the molten metal material to the outer peripheral gap of the pair of glass plates.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">PTL 5 also describes that, since a metal material injecting operation that is difficult particularly when the outer peripheral gap is narrow is accelerated and made easy by the guide and additionally the injecting speed is raised, the metal material and the glass substrates can be bonded directly with ease. PTL 5 further describes that a molten metal material can reliably be filled into an outer peripheral gap by appropriately selecting the size and the shape of the guide according to the outer peripheral gap.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, PTL 5 describes a method of manufacturing a glass panel from a pair of glass plates having different sizes, the edges of one of the glass plates projecting beyond the corresponding respective edges of the other glass plates, wherein molten solder is made to permeate from the projection sections of the one of the glass plates toward the outer peripheral gap by means of a capillary phenomenon to fill the molten solder into the outer peripheral gap. PTL 5 also describes that such a capillary phenomenon can be produced by applying vibrations to at least either the molten solder or the glass plates to improve the wettability of the molten solder relative to the glass plates.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additionally, a specific solder supply apparatus is described in Example 14 of PTL 5. The solder supply apparatus feeds molten solder by means of the self weight of the latter from a solder melting tank into an outer peripheral gap of a pair of glass plates disposed to form a gap of 0.2 mm between the main surfaces thereof to be bonded to a metal material by way of a pipe having an inner diameter of 3 mm, inserting a 0.15 mm-thick metal-made and plate-shaped guide fitted to the front end of the pipe into the outer peripheral gap by about 5 mm and filling molten solder into the outer peripheral gap along the outer peripheral edge of the glass plate. The width of the outer peripheral gap sealed by molten solder by means of the solder supply apparatus is about 5 mm from the outer peripheral edge and no problem is observed as a result of a leak test, a measurement of the heat transmission coefficient, a migration test of lead and a measurement of the oxygen content.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">[Problem No. 1]</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0021">Both of the techniques described in the above-cited PTLs 2 and 3 relate to handling molten metal in a non-oxidizing atmosphere and provide an advantageous effect in that they can suppress the generation of oxide in a process of melting a low melting point metallic material and a process of supplying molten metal and thereby suppress generation of defects attributable to the oxide generated in those processes. However, the oxide that already exists on the surface of a low melting point metallic material in a solid phase cannot be removed completely by handling the molten metal material in a non-oxidizing atmosphere by means of either of the techniques of PTLs 2 and 3 and is mixed into the molten metal material. In short, these techniques cannot completely overcome the problem of PTL 1 and NPL 1. Additionally, when a bonding material containing one or more easily oxidizable elements is directly bonded to a body to be bonded having an oxidized surface as disclosed in NPL 1, oxygen is required to exist to a predetermined extent between the oxidized surface and the bonding material in order to secure the bonding performance between them. On the other hand, the oxygen promotes oxidation of the molten bonding material to consequently generate oxide film between the bonding material and the body to be bonded to degrade the bonding performance. The techniques of PTLs 2 and 3 cannot solve this trade-off problem because, according to them, various operations need to be conducted in a non-oxidizing atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0022">Therefore, the first object of the present invention is to provide a molten metal supply cylinder having a simple configuration when compared with the configurations of the prior art and being able to suppress the mixing of oxide into molten metal when melting a low melting point metallic material in a solid phase and supplying the molten metal material, and a molten metal supply apparatus and a molten metal supply method for supplying molten metal by suppressing intermingling of oxide by means of such a supply cylinder.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">[Problem No. 2]</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0023">In view of the known techniques described in the above-cited PTLs 4 and 5, the second object of the present invention is to provide a molten metal supply cylinder that is improved relative to the prior art in terms of supplying molten metal to an outer peripheral gap between a pair of plate-shaped bodies that are objects to be bonded having respective main surfaces disposed with a gap between them, a molten metal supply apparatus incorporating such a supply cylinder and a molten metal supply method.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">[Problem No. 3]</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0024">When forming a bonding section by filling molten solder into an outer peripheral gap between a pair of glass plates, the molten solder discharge port needs to be separated from the corresponding end facets of the glass plates for a certain distance as pointed out in PTL 4. In such a case, molten solder is filled in a state where the gap formed between the discharge port and the end facets of the glass plates is also filled. Then, molten solder leaks out from the gap to produce a state where molten solder is not only filled into an outer peripheral gap of glass plates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> but also molten solder n<b>1</b> is made to adhere to the end facts of the glass plates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51(</figref><i>b</i>). As the quantity of molten solder that leaks out from the gap produced between the discharge port and the end facets of the glass plates increases, the molten solder n<b>1</b> adhering to the end facets rises high and can eventually flow down along the end facet of the glass plate w<b>4</b> in an extreme instance. Such a glass panel is not only favorable in terms of appearance but also detrimental to installation thereof. Additionally, if the molten solder that leaks out drops onto the mounting surface of a member on which the glass plates are to be mounted, there arise a quality problem that the molten solder contaminates the surface of the glass plate w<b>4</b> that is required to be clean and an industrial production problem that the positioning accuracy of the glass plate w<b>4</b> is degraded in the vertical direction when the glass plate w<b>4</b> is mounted on the member receiving the glass plate.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0025">While these problems can be dissolved by providing a properly dimensioned gap between the molten solder discharge port and the end facets of the glass plates or selecting an appropriate molten solder supplying rate, it is very difficult and costly to determine proper conditions for glass panels of various shapes and dimensions from the viewpoint of industrial production.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0026">Therefore, the third object of the present invention is to provide a molten metal supply cylinder that hardly allows molten metal to adhere to the corresponding end facets of a pair of plate-shaped bodies that are objects to be bonded having respective main surfaces disposed with a gap between them when supplying molten metal to an outer peripheral gap between the plate-shaped bodies, a molten metal supply apparatus incorporating such a supply cylinder and a molten metal supply method.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">[Problem No. 4]</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0027">In addition to the above problem No. 3, if a method of injecting molten solder into an outer peripheral gap of a pair of glass plates by utilizing a capillary phenomenon as described in PTL 5 is employed, when the pair of glass plates have different dimensions and the edges of one of the glass plates project beyond the corresponding respective edges of the other glass plate as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51(</figref><i>d</i>), molten solder n<b>2</b> leaks out to cover most of the projecting part of the glass plate w<b>4</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51(</figref><i>d</i>), although the molten solder may hardly flow down along the end facet of the glass plate w<b>4</b>. Additionally, there arises a problem that the width of the bonding section n is not stable and can vary between 2.5 and 4 mm as described in Example 1 of PTL 5.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0028">Thus, the fourth object of the present invention is to provide a molten metal supply cylinder that hardly allows molten metal to adhere to the corresponding end facets of a pair of plate-shaped bodies that are objects to be bonded having respective main surfaces disposed with a gap between them when supplying molten metal to an outer peripheral gap between the plate-shaped bodies, a molten metal supply apparatus incorporating such a supply cylinder and a molten metal supply method. More particularly, the fourth object is to provide a molten metal supply cylinder that, when the pair of plate-shaped bodies have different dimensions and the edges of one of the plate-shaped bodies project beyond the corresponding respective edges of the other plate-shaped bodies, hardly allows molten metal to leak out and can stably supplying molten solder into the outer peripheral gap with a constant width, a molten metal supply apparatus incorporating such a supply cylinder and a molten metal supply method.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">[Problem No. 5]</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0029">When inserting a guide as described in PTL 5 into an outer peripheral gap and filling a molten metal material there, the molten metal material flows in the gap formed between the guide and the glass substrates before the molten metal material is filled into the outer peripheral gap. The flow resistance increases as the gap between the guide and the glass substrates decreases. Then, the molten solder flowing through the gap can hardly get to the front end of the guide. Additionally, since the guide moves in a direction orthogonal relative to the direction in which the molten metal material is supplied, the rate at which molten solder flows through the gap between the guide and the glass substrates falls toward the front end of the guide. As a result of these, it is difficult to stably supply the molten metal material into the outer peripheral gap with a constant width when the outer peripheral gap is made narrow. The inventor of the present invention found that, when the gap between the guide and the glass substrates is narrowed to such an extent that, when the guide is moved, molten solder moves to follow the guide, the bonding strength of the bonding section and the glass plates is increased and specifically the gap that can increase the bonding strength is about between 0.01 and 0.005 mm. However, when the gap between the guide of PTL 5 and the glass substrates is made to be about between 0.01 and 0.005 mm, there arises a problem that molten solder gets to the front end of the guide by only a small quantity and the width thereof is not stable. Additionally, there also arises a problem that a defect of line-shaped or dot-shaped voids appears along the bonding interfaces of the glass substrates and the bonding section due to an insufficient supply of molten solder to consequently reduce the bonding strength.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0030">Thus, the fifth object of the present invention is to provide a molten metal supply cylinder that can stably supplying molten metal with a constant width into an outer peripheral gap of a pair of plate-shaped bodies that are objects to be bonded having respective main surfaces disposed with a gap between them when supplying molten metal into the outer peripheral gap, a molten metal supply apparatus incorporating such a supply cylinder and a molten metal supply method.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0031">(1) A molten metal supply cylinder according to the present invention that achieves the above first object is for melting a low melting point metallic material in a solid phase and supply the molten metal material and characterized by including a melting section to be directly or indirectly brought into contact with a low melting point metallic material to produce molten metal and a substantially tubular flow path that has a first opening formed at an end thereof in the melting section and a second opening at the other end thereof and allows the molten metal produced in the melting section to flow, wherein the oxide on the surface of the low melting point metallic material is removed by an oxide removing section before/when the low melting point metallic material is molten in the melting section.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0032">The supply cylinder as defined in (1) above operates in a manner as described below. Namely, a low melting point metallic material in a solid phase is molten to produce molten metal as the low melting point metallic material is brought into contact with the melting section and the molten metal flows into the flow path through the first opening and the molten metal flows through the flow path before it flows out from the second opening. Since the flow path is closed except the first opening and the second opening, molten metal is not brought into contact with the atmosphere when the molten metal is being supplied so that generating of oxide is suppressed and mixing of oxide into molten metal is avoided. Additionally, since any oxide in the surface layer of the low melting point metallic material is removed by the oxide removing section before the low melting point metallic material is molten in the melting section, the oxide adhering to the surface of the low melting point metallic material is prevented from entering the flow path. As far as this specification is concerned, &#x201c;a low melting point metal&#x201d; refers to a metal that melts at a relatively low temperature generally not higher than 400&#xb0; C. such as Sn, In, Zn, Ga or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0033">(2) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (1) above, the oxide removing section and the melting section are arranged close to each other in order to prevent an oxide from being produced on the surface of the low melting point metallic material from which the oxide has been removed. Preferably, the oxide removing section and the melting section are arranged integrally so as to remove the oxide on the surface of the low melting point metallic material when the low melting point metallic material melts.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0034">(3) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (2) above, the first opening is open to the oxide removing section and the area of the first opening is less than the area by which the low melting point metallic material contacts the melting section. As the area of the first opening is less than the area by which the low melting point metallic material contacts the melting section so that the low melting point metallic material contacts the melting section so as to close the first opening, the oxide adhering to the surface of the low melting point metallic material is removed at an outer peripheral section of the first opening and the oxide entering the flow path is blocked.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0035">(4) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (2) or (3) above, an oxide capturing section is arranged around the first opening so as to capture the oxide and not to allow the oxide to move in order to prevent the oxide that has been blocked from entering the flow path from moving and entering the flow path once again.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0036">(5) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (2) or (3) above further includes an oxide discharging section that discharges oxide from around the first opening in order to prevent the oxide blocked from entering the flow path from accumulating in an unopened area around the first opening and entering the flow path once again.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0037">(6) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (1) above, the oxide removing section is provided as a separate body so as to remove the oxide on the surface of the low melting point metallic material before the low melting point metallic material melts.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0038">(7) In the supply cylinder according to (6) above, the oxide removing section may include an edge section that removes the surface layer of the low melting point metallic material, (8) a plasma irradiation means or (9) a shot blasting means.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0039">(10) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (1) above, the surface of the flow path is subjected to a process for improving the wettability thereof relative to molten metal in order to stably and smoothly supplying molten metal. The process may be a metal layer forming process of Cr, Al, Mo, W, V, Nb, Ta, Ti or the like, using a plating technique or a CVD or PVD or some other sputtering technique when using solder as a low melting point metal.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0040">(11) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (1) above, the surface of the flow path is subjected to an anti-corrosion treatment relative to molten metal in order to prevent contamination by molten metal so that the surface of the flow path may not be corroded by flowing molten metal and no impurity may be mixed into molten solder M<b>1</b>. When the supply cylinder is made of steel or a similar material, a technique of nitriding the surface of the flow path or a technique of coating the surface of the flow path with ceramic such as TiN may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0041">(12) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (1) above further includes a guide section that guides the molten metal produced from the melting section and discharged from the second opening so as to stably supply the molten metal flowing out from the second opening to a work.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042">Such a guide section is preferably fitted to the second opening of the supply cylinder from which molten metal flows out from the viewpoint of reliably supplying a desired quantity of molten metal to the outer peripheral gap and stabilizing the width of the supplied molten metal. Furthermore, as will be described in detail below by way of best modes of carrying out the invention, any oxide is prevented from being mixed into the molten metal that is being supplied from the second opening to the outer peripheral gap in certain cases.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0043">(13) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (12) above, the guide section is substantially flat plate-shaped when molten metal is to be supplied to the surface of a plate-shaped member and/or the gap between a pair of plate-shaped members.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0044">(14) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (12) above, the guide section is substantially pillar-shaped or substantially cylinder-shaped when molten metal is supplied into a void formed in a work.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0045">(15) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to any of (12) through (14) above, the guide section has a tapered profile in order to smoothly guide molten metal and supply the molten metal to a work without interruption.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0046">(16) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to any of (12) through (14) above, guide grooves are formed in the guide section for molten metal in order to smoothly guide molten metal and supply the molten metal to a work without interruption.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0047">(17) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to any of (12) through (14) above, a contact surface is formed on the guide section so as to contact the surface to which molten metal is to be supplied in order to remove the air bubbles and the foreign object existing on the surface of a work, activate the surface of the work and improve the wettablity of the molten metal relative to the surface of the work.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0048">(18) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (12) above for supplying molten metal to an outer peripheral gap of a pair of plate-shaped bodies having respective main surfaces disposed with a gap between them, the guide section includes a trowel section that has a first plane surface for facing the main surface of one of the plate-shaped bodies with a first gap interposed between them and a second plane surface for facing the main surface of the other plate-shaped body with a second gap interposed between them and is able to be inserted into an outer peripheral gap of the pair of plate-shaped bodies, a first contact section that projects from the first plane surface of the trowel section so as to be contactable to the main surface of one of the plate-shaped bodies and/or a second contact section that projects from the second plane surface of the trowel section so as to be contactable to the main surface of the other plate-shaped body for the purpose of achieving the above second object.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0049">With the supply cylinder according to (18) above, the molten metal supplied to an outer peripheral gap of a pair of plate-shaped bodies is supplied there by the trowel section of the guide section that is inserted into the outer peripheral gap and moved along the corresponding outer peripheral edges of the pair of plate-shaped bodies. In this operation of supplying molten metal, the molten metal injected into the first gap and the second gap respectively formed between the main surfaces of the plate-shaped bodies and the first plane surface and the second plan surface of the trowel section is pressed by the trowel section against and applied to the main surfaces of the plate-shaped bodies as the trowel section is moved along the outer peripheral edges of the plate-shaped bodies. The molten metal is provided with fluidity by the applying operation and accelerates activation of the main surfaces to improve the wettablity of the main surfaces relative to molten metal and, at the same time, remove the air bubbles and the foreign objects existing at the contact interferences of the molten metal and the main surfaces to consequently improve the quality of bonding of the plate-shaped bodies to be bonded and the bonding section.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0050">Additionally, the first contact section is so formed in the guide section as to project from the first plane surface of the trowel section and be contactable to the main surface of one of the plate-shaped bodies, whereas the second contact section is so formed in the guide section as to project from the second plane surface of the trowel section and be contactable to the main surface of the other plate-shaped body. Because of this arrangement, if the trowel section is moved relatively in the direction of the thickness of the outer peripheral gap due to a problem of operation accuracy, for example, of the mechanism for positioning the pair of plate-shaped bodies or of the mechanism for moving the guide section, the trowel section is prevented from directly contacting the main surfaces because the contact sections respectively contact the main surfaces to consequently protect the main surfaces against damage and improve the quality of bonding of the plate-shaped bodies and the bonding section. The guide section may be provided only with the first contact section or the second contact section or with both of the contact sections depending on the required level of operation accuracy of the peripheral equipment for driving the guide section and/or that of dimensional accuracy of the outer peripheral gap produced when the plate-shaped bodies are combined.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0051">Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (18) above, the guide grooves as defined in (16) above are formed at the contact sections. The reason for this will be described below. For supplying molten metal to an outer peripheral gap, for example, molten metal may be supplied to the outer peripheral gap in front of the guide section in the sense of the moving direction of the guide section moving along the corresponding outer peripheral edges of the pair of plate-shaped bodies and subsequently the moving trowel section may be immersed in the supplied molten solder. However, with this arrangement, molten metal flows into the outer peripheral gap before the trowel section is immersed and then it is difficult to supply molten metal with a constant width due to fluctuations of the pressure of the molten metal being supplied and/or unevenness of the wettability of molten metal relative to the plate-shaped bodies to give rise to a risk of making the width of the bonding section uneven when the bonding section is formed. Additionally, there can be occasions where molten solder cannot be supplied sufficiently when the outer peripheral gap becomes narrow. On the other hand, in the above-described preferable mode of carrying out the invention, molten metal flows directly and smoothly to the trowel section by way of the guide grooves formed in the contact sections and the width of the area wetted with molten metal is restricted to the range of the trowel section because the trowel section is wetted with molten metal so that molten metal is supplied with a constant width to make it possible to provide the bonding section with a uniform width. Additionally, as will be described in detail hereinafter, the oxide produced on the surface of the molten metal supplied to the outer peripheral gap is prevented from being rolled in to provide an effect of improving the quality of bonding of the bonding section and the plate-shaped bodies in certain cases.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0052">(19) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (18) above, the first contact section contacts the main surface of one of the plate-shaped bodies and the second contact section contacts the main surface of the other plate-shaped body when the guide section is inserted into the outer peripheral gap. With this preferable arrangement, the first contact section and the second contact section constantly contact the respective main surfaces of the pair of plate-shaped bodies so that the guide section is held in a state of being inserted into the outer peripheral gap by the first contact section and the second contact section. Then, the quantity of the first gap between the first plane surface of the trowel section and the main surface of one of the plate-shaped bodies is restricted by the quantity by which the first contact section projects, while the quantity of the second gap between the second plane surface of the trowel section and the main surface of the other plate-shaped body is restricted by the quantity by which the second contact section projects. Thus, the quantity of the first gap and that of the second gap respectively between the main surfaces of the plate-shaped bodies and the trowel section are always held to a constant value during the above-described supply operation so that molten metal is applied to the main surfaces always under a same condition to uniformize the bonding strength of the bonding section and the plate-shaped bodies and improve the quality of bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0053">(20) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (18) above, the contact surfaces of the contact sections for contacting the main surfaces of plate-shaped bodies are subjected to a process for raising the slidability of the contact sections relative to plate-shaped bodies in order to prevent the plate-shaped bodies from being damaged by a sliding motion that takes place between the plate-shaped bodies and the contact sections as the guide section is driven to move and make the contact sections slide smoothly.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0054">(21) For the same purpose, preferably the contact sections are provided with respective recesses extending in the direction in which the guide section is inserted into the outer peripheral gap to reduce the contact area between the contact sections and the plate-shaped bodies.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0055">(22) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (18) above, the contact sections are arranged at the rear end side of the guide section as viewed in the direction of inserting the guide section into the outer peripheral gap when a wiring pattern or the like is formed at an inner peripheral section of the bonding section formed on the main surfaces of the plate-shaped bodies in order to prevent the wiring pattern from being damaged as a result of contacting the contact sections.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0056">(23) Preferably, the contact sections are arranged at the front end side of the guide section as viewed in the direction of inserting the guide section into the outer peripheral gap when a wiring pattern or the like is formed at an outer peripheral section of the bonding section formed on the main surfaces of the plate-shaped bodies. As will be described in detail hereinafter, in certain cases, the width of the bonding section can be highly precisely restricted by restricting the flowing move of the molten metal by the contact sections arranged at the front end side.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0057">(24) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (18) above, the contact sections have elasticity of being capable of flexibly bending in the direction of the thickness of the outer peripheral gap.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0058">This preferable mode of carrying out the invention provides an advantageous effect as described below. Namely, the plate-shaped bodies may be brought into a condition where they contact with the guide section in the above-described filling operation because the moving path of the guide section and the outer peripheral gap are poorly parallel relative to each other particularly, for example, when a sufficient degree of assembling accuracy is not secured and the outer peripheral gap of the plate-shaped bodies is bent or when the outer peripheral gap is formed linearly but a sufficient degree of accuracy of motion is not secured for the mechanism for driving the plate-shaped bodies and consequently the guide section shifts its position aside in the direction of the thickness of the outer peripheral gap as it moves so as to loose its relative parallelism of motion. However, with the above-described arrangement, the plate-shaped bodies firstly and respectively contact the first contact section and the second contact section to press the first and second contact sections in the direction of the thickness of the outer peripheral gap with force of a predetermined magnitude. Since the pressed first and second contact sections are flexibly bent due to their elasticity, the guide section moves vertically, accommodating the positional fluctuations of the outer peripheral gap in the direction of the thickness thereof. Then, as a result, the trowel section and the plate-shaped bodies are prevented from contacting each other in a condition as described above and molten metal can be reliably filled into the outer peripheral gap.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0059">(25) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (12) above for supplying molten metal to an outer peripheral gap of a pair of plate-shaped bodies having respective main surfaces disposed with a gap between them, the guide section is fitted so as to cross the second opening and divide the second opening into an upper discharge port and a lower discharge port by the guide section and the quantity of molten metal discharged from the lower discharge port is smaller than the quantity of molten metal discharged from the upper discharge port for the purpose of achieving the above third object. With this arrangement, of the molten metal discharged from the discharge ports, the quantity of molten metal held in a downwardly released state can be reduced to make it possible to prevent molten metal from rising up or sinking down at the corresponding end facets of the plate-shaped bodies.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0060">(26) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (25) above, the area of the lower discharge port is smaller than that of the upper discharge port.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0061">(27) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (25) above, the guide section is inserted from the second opening into the flow path by a predetermined depth and the flow path is divided into an upper flow path and a lower flow path by the guide section in such a way that the volume of the lower flow path is smaller than the volume of the upper flow path.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0062">(28) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (25) above, the guide section is inserted into the flow path in a state of being downwardly offset from the center of the second opening.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0063">(29) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (25) above, the guide section is inserted into the flow path, crossing the second opening at or near the center thereof, and a barrier plate is fitted to the discharge port forming plane of the flow path located below the guide section in order to make the area of the lower discharge port smaller than the area of the upper discharge port.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0064">(30) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (25) above, the guide section is inserted into the flow path, crossing the second opening at or near the center thereof, and a barrier member is formed in the lower flow path of the flow path in order to make the volume of the lower flow path smaller than the volume of the upper flow path.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0065">(31) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (12) above for supplying molten metal to an outer peripheral gap of a pair of plate-shaped bodies having respective main surfaces disposed with a gap between them, the guide section is fitted at a lower section of the second opening or at a position lower than the second opening so as to allow the molten metal discharged from the second opening to flow out from the top surface of the guide section for the purpose of achieving the above fourth object. Thus, the molten metal discharged from the second opening is made to flow only from the top surface of the guide section and not along the bottom surface thereof. Then, if the pair of plate-shaped bodies is arranged in such a way that the lower one of them projects from the upper one to produce a projecting part, molten metal scarcely leaks and adheres to the projecting part. If the pair of plate-shaped bodies is arranged in such a way that the edges thereof are located side by side, the quantity of molten metal held in a downwardly released state is small so that it is possible to prevent molten metal from rising up or sinking down at the corresponding end facets of the plate-shaped bodies.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0066">(32) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (31) above, a through path section that leads molten metal from the top surface toward the bottom surface side is formed at a front end section of the guide section.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0067">(33) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (31) above, the guide section has a slope section extending from the front end section and the front end section and the slope section form an obtuse angle or a right angle to show a bent profile.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0068">(34) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (31) above, the guide section has a slope section extending from the front end section and a base end section extending from the slope section and the front end section and the base end section are parallel relative to each other or form an obtuse angle so that the guide section is bent twice to show a stepped profile.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0069">(35) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (31) above further includes a cut out surface produced by axially cutting out a lower section thereof including the flow path from the side of the second opening by a predetermined length, wherein the guide section is fitted with its top surface held in contact with the cut out surface, and when the cut out flow path is exposed to the bottom surface side of the guide section, a member is fitted to seal the gap there.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0070">(36) Preferably, the supply cylinder according to (31) above further includes a plane surface section which does not expose the flow path, at a lower section thereof within an axial range of a predetermined length from the second opening, wherein the guide section is fitted with its top surface held in contact with the plane surface section.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0071">(37) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (31) above, the pair of plate-shaped bodies are arranged one above the other in such a way that the edges of the lower plate-shaped body project beyond the corresponding respective edges of the upper plate-shaped body.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0072">(38) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (12) above for supplying molten metal to an outer peripheral gap of a pair of plate-shaped bodies having respective main surfaces disposed with a gap between them, a cut out section is formed at the front end section of the guide section at the side facing the moving direction of the guide section in order to achieve the above fifth object.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0073">With the above-described configuration, molten metal can partly be made to flow from the main surface of the guide section to a lateral surface of the cut out section and then further to the front end of the guide section along the lateral surface. Then, the molten metal flowing along the lateral surface gets to the front end of the guide section so as to flow further along the front end of the guide section to make it possible to stably obtain a bonding section with a predetermined width because the molten metal is positionally restricted by the front edge of the guide section and longitudinally limited by the length of the guide section. Additionally, the quantity of molten metal at the front end side of the guide section increases to improve the bonding strength between the bonding section and the plate-shaped bodies.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0074">(39) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (38) above, the cut out section has an oblique facet facing rearward relative to the moving direction of the guide section.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0075">(40) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (38) above, the cut out section has an oblique facet facing rearward relative to the moving direction of the guide section and a facet that is smoothly linked to the oblique facet and substantially extends in parallel with the moving direction of the guide section.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0076">(41) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (38) above, the cut out section has an oblique facet facing rearward relative to the moving direction of the guide section and a facet that is smoothly linked to the oblique facet and substantially orthogonally intersects the moving direction of the guide section.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0077">(42) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (38) above, the cut out section is formed by straight lines, a curved line or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0078">(43) Preferably, in the supply cylinder according to (12) to (42) above, the surface of the guide section that contacts molten metal is subjected to a process for enhancing its wettability relative to molten metal.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0079">(44) A molten metal supply apparatus according to the present invention for achieving the above-described first object is characterized by including a molten metal supply cylinder according to any of (1) through (43) above.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0080">(45) Preferably, in the supply apparatus according to (44) above, the supply cylinder is indirectly or directly supported by a floating mechanism. In this preferable mode of carrying out the invention, the floating mechanism can accommodate the variation of shape of the work to which molten metal is applied and the variation of attitude of the supply cylinder to make it possible to stably apply molten metal to the work.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0081">(46) A molten metal supply apparatus according to the present invention and incorporating a molten metal supply cylinder according to any of (1) through (11) to achieve the above-described first object is characterized by including a plate-shaped body arranging means for arranging a pair of plate-shaped bodies in a state of producing a predetermined gap between them and a supply cylinder positioning means for positioning the supply cylinder in a state where the second opening and the gap are substantially connected to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0082">The supply apparatus in this mode of carrying out the invention operates in a manner as described below in terms of a case where the pair of plate-shaped bodies is a pair of rectangular glass substrates. Firstly, two glass substrates are arranged in a state where a predetermined gap is formed between them by the plate-shaped body arranging means. Next, the supply cylinder is positioned in such a way that the second opening and the gap are substantially connected to each other by the supply cylinder positioning means. Then, molten metal is supplied into the gap of the two glass substrates by way of the second opening of the supply cylinder. Since the second opening of the supply cylinder is arranged so as to be substantially connected to the gap of the two glass substrates, the molten metal that is supplied by way of the second opening is filled into the gap without touching the atmosphere so that the oxidation of the molten metal that takes place in the course of being supplied is suppressed. &#x201c;A state where the second opening and the gap are substantially connected to each other&#x201d; as described above means that not only a state where the second opening and the gap is closely connected to each other but also a state where a void gap is produced between the second opening and the corresponding end facets (that are perpendicular to the gap) of the two glass substrates and the second opening and the gap are not closely connected to each other but the molten metal flown out from the second opening does not leak out from the void gap are included within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0083">(47) A molten metal supply apparatus according to the present invention and incorporating a molten metal supply cylinder according to any of (12) through (43) above to achieve any of the above-described second through fifth objects is characterized by including a plate-shaped body arranging means for arranging a pair of plate-shaped bodies in a state of producing a predetermined gap between them and a supply cylinder positioning means for inserting the guide section into the gap formed between the pair of plate-shaped bodies. The supply apparatus as defined above can smoothly supply molten metal into the gap between the plate-shaped bodies by way of the guide section.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0084">(48) Preferably, in the supply apparatus according to (46) or (47) above, the second opening has a diameter exceeding the thickness of the outer peripheral gap. The supply apparatus in this mode of carrying out the invention operates in a manner as described below in terms of a case where the pair of plate-shaped bodies is a pair of glass substrates. The molten metal supplied by way of the second opening is not only supplied to the gap between the glass substrates but also to areas other than the gap, or the end facts (that are perpendicular to the gap) of the two glass substrates that are included in the second opening. Therefore, an excess material section of molten metal is formed outside the molten metal supplied to the gap to serve as a barrier and consequently to provide an effect of suppressing the progress of oxidation that otherwise takes place as the supplied molten metal contacts the atmosphere. Additionally, with this arrangement, molten metal can be made to adhere to the outer peripheral end facets of the pair of plate-shaped bodies to form a bonding section having a sealing effect of consequently covering the outer peripheral end facets. Hence, this arrangement is suitable when the bonding section is required to show an anti-leak effect.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0085">(49) Preferably, in the supply apparatus according to (46) or (47), the second opening has a diameter not greater than the thickness of the outer peripheral gap when it is not desirable to form a sealing section at the outer peripheral end facets from the viewpoint of installation of the glass panel and appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0086">(50) Preferably, in the supply apparatus according to (46) or (47), the guide section is indirectly or directly supported by a floating mechanism from the viewpoint similar to the one as described above for the floating mechanism of the supply apparatus according to (45) above.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0087">(51) Preferably, in the supply apparatus according to (50) above, the floating mechanism is so arranged as to constrain the guide section in terms of movement in a plane parallel to the gap formed between the pair of plate-shaped bodies.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0088">With the supply apparatus in this desirable mode of carrying out the invention, the guide section is supported by a floating mechanism that constrains the guide section in terms of movement in a plane parallel to the gap formed between the pair of plate-shaped bodies. In other words, the guide section can move in the direction of the thickness of the outer peripheral gap and around the insertion axis of the guide section. Then, as a result, if the position of the outer peripheral gap of the plate-shaped bodies is shifted, the guide section is made to move vertically in the direction of the thickness of the outer peripheral gap to follow the shift by the floating mechanism so as to maintain the gaps formed between the main surfaces of the plate-shaped bodies and the trowel section so that molten metal is stably filled into the outer peripheral gap.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0089">(52) Preferably, the supply apparatus according to (46) or (47) further includes an ultrasonic wave application means for applying ultrasonic waves to the interface of the molten metal and the plate-shaped bodies because it is desirable that the air bubbles and the foreign objects existing at the interface of the molten metal and the plate-shaped bodies are removed in order to improve wettability of the molten metal supplied to the gap by way of the guide section relative to the plate-shaped bodies and thereby improve the bonding reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0090">(53) A molten metal supply method according to the present invention that achieves the above first object is a method of supplying molten metal by means of a molten metal supply cylinder according to any of (1) through (11) above, characterized by including a plate-shaped body arranging step of arranging a pair of plate-shaped bodies in a state of producing a predetermined gap between them, a supply cylinder positioning step of positioning the supply cylinder in a state where the second opening and the gap are substantially connected to each other and a molten metal supply step of supplying molten metal to the gap by way of the second opening.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0091">The supply method in this mode of carrying out the invention operates in a manner as described below in terms of a case where the pair of plate-shaped bodies is a pair of glass substrates. Firstly, two glass substrates are arranged in a state where a predetermined gap is formed between them in the plate-shaped body arranging step. Next, the supply cylinder is positioned in such a way that the second opening and the gap are substantially connected to each other in the supply cylinder positioning step. Then, molten metal is supplied into the gap of the two glass substrates by way of the second opening of the supply cylinder in the molten metal supply step. Since the second opening of the supply cylinder is arranged so as to be substantially connected to the gap of the two glass substrates, the molten metal that is supplied by way of the second opening is filled into the gap without touching the atmosphere so that the oxidation of the molten metal that takes place in the course of being supplied is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0092">(54) A molten metal supply method according to the present invention that achieves any of the above second through fifth objects is a method of supplying molten metal by means of a molten metal supply cylinder according to any of (12) through (43) above, characterized by including a plate-shaped body arranging step of arranging a pair of plate-shaped bodies in a state of producing a predetermined gap between them, a supply cylinder positioning step of inserting the guide section into the gap formed between the pair of plate-shaped bodies and a molten metal supply step of supplying molten metal into the gap by way of the second opening. This supply method can smoothly supply molten metal into the gap between the plate-shaped bodies by way of the guide section.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0093">(55) Preferably, in the supply method according to (53) or (54) above, ultrasonic waves are applied to the interface of the molten metal and the plate-shaped bodies because it is desirable that the air bubbles and the foreign objects existing at the interface of the molten metal and the plate-shaped bodies are removed in order to improve wettability of the molten metal supplied to the gap by way of the guide section relative to the plate-shaped bodies and thereby improve the bonding reliability.</p>

<heading id="h-0017" level="1">BEST MODES OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0143" num="0146">Now, the present invention will be described in greater detail by referring to the accompanying drawings that illustrate preferred embodiments of the invention. Note that the embodiment will be described below in terms of a case where a glass panel is manufactured by supplying molten solder of an Sn Ag Al based alloy that is a low melting point metallic material into an outer peripheral gap of a pair of glass substrates that are plate-shaped bodies and subsequently bonding the pair of glass substrates as objects to be bonded. However, the present invention can provide similar advantages and effects when the glass substrates are replaced by metal substrates or ceramic substrates. Additionally, the present invention can provide similar advantages and effects when solder of any of various compositions containing Sn, Zn, Ti and/or In based alloy or the like as low melting point metal is used. The present invention is by no means limited to these embodiments, which can be modified in different ways within the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">[First Mode of Carrying Out the Invention]</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0147">Firstly, preferable modes of carrying out the invention for a molten metal supply cylinder as described above in (1) above, a molten metal supply apparatus incorporating such a supply cylinder and a molten metal supply method will be described below by way of Example No. 1-1, Example No. 1-2 and Example No. 1-3.</p>
<heading id="h-0019" level="1">Example No. 1-1</heading>
<p id="p-0145" num="0148">A molten metal supply cylinder and a molten metal supply apparatus incorporating such a supply cylinder will be described below as Example No. 1-1 by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 8</figref> and <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0149">The configuration of a glass panel manufactured by means of the supply apparatus of Example No. 1-1 will be described by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>50</b>(<i>c</i>), reference symbol W denotes a glass panel manufactured by using the supply apparatus of Example No. 1-1. Reference symbols w<b>1</b> and w<b>2</b> respectively denote paired glass substrates whose main surfaces face each other with a gap of predetermined dimension g disposed between them. Reference symbol m denotes a frame-shaped bonding section arranged at an outer peripheral section of the oppositely disposed glass substrates w<b>1</b> and w<b>2</b>, more specifically slightly inside the outer peripheral edges of the glass substrates, so as to be directly bonded to the main surface to produce an airtight chamber to be described later. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50(</figref><i>b</i>) and <b>50</b>(<i>c</i>), the bonding section m is produced as bonding section m<b>1</b> formed on the glass substrate w<b>1</b> and bonding section m<b>2</b> formed on the glass substrate w<b>2</b> are bonded at the bonding surfaces thereof and brought into a unified state. An SnAgAl based alloy which is a low melting point metal showing an excellent bonding performance relative to the glass substrates w<b>1</b> and w<b>2</b> and contains specifically Ag by 8.5% and Al by 0.35% in terms of mass %, Sn taking the balance, is employed for the bonding section m. The space defined by the glass substrates w<b>1</b> and w<b>2</b> and the bonding section m constitutes an airtight chamber and a vacuum atmosphere or predetermined gas or liquid is sealed in the airtight chamber according to the application of the glass panel W.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0150">Note, however, that the configuration of the glass panel W is not limited to the above-described one and a configuration where glass panel W is produced by directly bonding a bonding section m only to one of the glass substrates, or glass substrate w<b>1</b>, and subsequently boding the molten bonding section m to the other glass substrate w<b>2</b> by way of under layer u that is highly wettable relative to the bonding section m as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50(</figref><i>d</i>), and a configuration where glass panel W is produced by directly bonding a bonding section m only to one of the glass substrates, or glass substrate w<b>1</b>, and subsequently boding the molten bonding section m to the other glass substrate w<b>2</b> by way of frame member V made of metal or glass to secure the gap between the glass substrates w<b>1</b> and w<b>2</b> and glass frit G as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50(</figref><i>e</i>) are not excluded. In other words, the supply apparatus and the supply method of Example No. 1-1 are applicable to any glass panel W where bonding section m is directly bonded to one of a pair of glass substrates w<b>1</b> and w<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0151">Now, a manufacturing line for manufacturing glass panel W as described above will be described below by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Reference symbol <b>1</b> denotes the manufacturing line for glass panel W that includes the supply apparatus as described above by way of Example No. 1-1 and the manufacturing line <b>1</b> includes a preloading chamber <b>1</b><i>a </i>containing glass substrates w<b>1</b> and w<b>2</b> and a predetermined atmosphere, a preprocessing chamber <b>1</b><i>b </i>for conducting a heat treatment, a plasma irradiation treatment and so on onto the glass substrates w<b>1</b> and w<b>2</b> in order to remove the foreign objects and the moisture adhering to the surfaces thereof, a molten solder supply chamber <b>1</b><i>c </i>incorporating the supply apparatus as described above by way of Example No. 1-1, a bonding chamber <b>1</b><i>d </i>for bonding the glass substrates w<b>1</b> and w<b>2</b> to produce a glass panel, a cooling chamber <b>1</b><i>e </i>for cooling the glass panel, an unloading chamber <b>1</b><i>f </i>for discharging the glass panel, the chambers <b>1</b><i>a </i>through <b>1</b><i>f </i>being arranged sequentially in the above-described order, and a conveyer means for conveying the glass substrates w<b>1</b> and w<b>2</b> treated in each of the above-described chambers to the next step. On the manufacturing line <b>1</b>, the prepared glass substrates w<b>1</b> and w<b>2</b> are put into the preloading chamber <b>1</b><i>a </i>and subsequently treated sequentially in the preprocessing chamber <b>1</b><i>b</i>, the molten solder supply chamber <b>1</b><i>c</i>, the bonding chamber <b>1</b><i>d</i>, the cooling chamber <b>1</b><i>e </i>and the unloading chamber <b>1</b><i>f </i>in the above mentioned order to manufacture a glass panel W.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0152">The supply apparatus of Example No. 1-1 incorporated in the molten solder supply chamber <b>1</b><i>c </i>will be described below by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 6</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, reference symbol <b>2</b> denotes the supply apparatus. The supply apparatus <b>2</b> includes a thread solder supply means <b>2</b><i>a</i>, a heating/melting means <b>3</b>, a moving means <b>2</b><i>e</i>, an airtight chamber <b>2</b><i>k </i>containing the above listed means, a control means <b>2</b><i>p </i>for controlling the operation of each of the means and an atmosphere control means <b>2</b><i>s </i>for controlling the atmosphere in the airtight chamber <b>2</b><i>k</i>. Now, each of the above listed components will be described below by way of an example where molten solder is supplied to one of the glass substrates, or glass substrate w<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">[Thread Solder Supply Means]</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0153">Reference symbol <b>2</b><i>b </i>denotes a bobbin-shaped thread solder feeding section that carries a wire-shaped material made of an SnAgAl based alloy (to be referred to as thread solder hereinafter) wound around it and is adapted to be driven to rotate by a motor or the like (not shown) and quantitatively feed out thread solder M. Reference symbol <b>2</b><i>c </i>denotes a substantially tubular thread solder guide section having a through hole that is a guide path through which thread solder M can pass and which has two open ends. Thread solder M formed with a diameter of about 2 mm is employed in the supply apparatus <b>2</b>. In the initial state, the thread solder M is set in a state where it is wound around the thread solder feeding section <b>2</b><i>b </i>and a front end part of the thread solder M that is drawn out from the thread solder feeding section <b>2</b><i>b </i>is inserted into the guide path from the upper end opening of the thread solder guide section <b>2</b><i>c </i>and projecting from the lower end opening (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0154">A preferable exemplar thread solder feeding section <b>2</b><i>b </i>will be described below by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The thread solder feeding section <b>5</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a package for storing thread solder M in a non-oxidizing atmosphere and includes a rotatable winding core <b>5</b><i>b </i>around which the thread solder M is wound to show a coil-shaped profile, a hollow cylindrical case <b>5</b><i>a </i>containing the thread solder M wound around the winding core <b>5</b><i>b</i>, a hole section <b>5</b><i>d </i>formed at the lateral surface of the case <b>5</b><i>a </i>and a drawing out member <b>5</b><i>e </i>fitted into and engaged with the hole section <b>5</b><i>d</i>. A drawing out hole having a diameter smaller than that of the thread solder M is bored through the drawing out member <b>5</b><i>e </i>and the drawing out member <b>5</b><i>e </i>is made of an elastic material such as rubber. Thus, when the free end of the thread solder M is drawn out from the drawing out hole, the inner surface of the drawing out hole tightly contacts the outer peripheral surface of the thread solder M to maintain the airtightness of the container chamber <b>5</b><i>c </i>of the thread solder feeding section <b>5</b> that is a package. Preferably, the atmosphere in the container chamber <b>5</b><i>c </i>is a vacuum atmosphere or an inert atmosphere and the container chamber <b>5</b><i>c </i>contains active carbon or a moisture removing agent in order to maintain the humidity ratio of the container chamber <b>5</b><i>c </i>to a constant level.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0155">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, reference symbol <b>2</b><i>d </i>denotes an ultrasonic wave applying section for irradiating ultrasonic waves to the contact interface of molten solder M<b>1</b> and the main surface S of glass substrate w<b>1</b> by way of the molten solder M<b>1</b> produced by melting thread solder M by the heating/melting means <b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Note that the ultrasonic wave applying section <b>2</b><i>d </i>is incorporated in the heating/melting means <b>3</b> for the convenience of forming the supply apparatus <b>2</b> in such a way that ultrasonic waves can be applied by way of a supply cylinder <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the heating/melting means <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">[Heating/Melting Means]</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0156">Reference symbol <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the heating/melting means <b>3</b> denotes a supply cylinder for supplying molten solder M<b>1</b> to the main surface S of the glass substrate w<b>1</b> on which a bonding section is to be formed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the supply cylinder <b>3</b><i>a </i>shows a substantially pillar-shaped profile and has a core member made of stainless steel showing a high thermal conductivity. A Cr layer that is highly wettable relative to molten solder M<b>1</b> is formed on the outer peripheral surface of the core member and an Ni layer that is poorly wettable relative to molten solder M<b>1</b> is formed on the Cr layer except the bottom surface of the supply cylinder <b>3</b><i>a</i>. The supply cylinder <b>3</b><i>a </i>is arranged in such a way that its bottom surface where the second opening <b>3</b><i>f </i>is formed faces the main surface S of the glass substrate w<b>1</b> so as to supply molten solder M<b>1</b> to the main surface S. Reference symbol <b>3</b><i>c </i>denotes a heater wound around the outer periphery of the supply cylinder <b>3</b><i>a </i>to heat the supply cylinder <b>3</b><i>a </i>to a temperature not lower than the melting point of thread solder M. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, reference symbol <b>3</b><i>b </i>denotes a main body section to which the supply cylinder <b>3</b><i>a </i>is rigidly secured and where the heat emitting circuit of the heater <b>3</b><i>c </i>etc. is incorporated. As described above, the ultrasonic wave generating unit, the control circuit and so on of the ultrasonic wave applying section <b>2</b><i>d </i>are contained in the main body section <b>3</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0157">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the supply cylinder <b>3</b><i>a </i>is provided at the top (one of the end sections thereof) with a melting section <b>3</b><i>g </i>where thread solder M contacts it to produce molten solder M<b>1</b> and one of the openings (the first opening) <b>3</b><i>e </i>is open. The other opening (the second opening) <b>3</b><i>f </i>is open at the bottom surface (the other end surface). A substantially cylindrical flow path <b>3</b><i>d </i>is arranged in the supply cylinder <b>3</b><i>a </i>so as to be closed except the first opening <b>3</b><i>e </i>and the second opening <b>3</b><i>f</i>. Thus, the molten solder M<b>1</b> that is produced at the melting section <b>3</b><i>g </i>flows into the flow path <b>3</b><i>d </i>from the first opening <b>3</b><i>e </i>that is an inlet port for molten solder M<b>1</b>, flows downward through the flow path <b>3</b><i>d</i>, flows out from the second opening <b>3</b><i>f </i>that is a discharge port and is supplied to the main surface S of the glass substrate w<b>1</b>. A Cr layer that improves the wettability of their surfaces relative to molten solder M<b>1</b> is formed on the melting section <b>3</b><i>g </i>and also on the flow path <b>3</b><i>d </i>as a preferable arrangement for smoothly flowing molten solder M<b>1</b>. Such a Cr layer may be replaced by a layer made of Al, Mo, W, V, Nb or Ta. Furthermore, the surface of the flow path <b>3</b><i>d </i>of this example is subjected to a nitriding treatment, which is an anti-corrosion treatment, so that the surface may not be corroded by molten solder M<b>1</b> and impurities may not be mixed into molten solder M<b>1</b> and the Cr layer is formed on the surface that is subjected to a nitriding treatment. A treatment for improving the wettablility and an anti-corrosion treatment may appropriately be selected according to the molten metal to be handled.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0158">The melting section <b>3</b><i>g </i>will be described in greater detail below. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>), the melting section <b>3</b><i>g </i>is formed at an upper part of the lateral surface of the supply cylinder <b>3</b><i>a </i>so as to show a recessed profile and an annular oxide removing section <b>4</b> is arranged at the bottom hereof so as to be integral with the melting section <b>3</b><i>g</i>. While the oxide removing section <b>4</b> is cross-hatched in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) for the purpose of easy understanding, the oxide removing section <b>4</b> is integrally formed with the melting section <b>3</b><i>g </i>without any juncture. The first opening <b>3</b><i>e </i>is open at a melting surface <b>3</b><i>j </i>that is the top surface of the oxide removing section <b>4</b> (the bottom surface of the melting section <b>3</b><i>g</i>) where thread solder M contacts and becomes molten. The diameter &#xf8;<b>2</b> of the first opening <b>3</b><i>e </i>is less than the diameter &#xf8;<b>1</b> of the end facet of thread solder M that contacts the melting surface <b>3</b><i>j. </i></p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0159">The bottom end of the thread solder guide section <b>2</b><i>c </i>is positioned at and rigidly secured to a securing member <b>2</b><i>j </i>of the moving means <b>2</b><i>e </i>in an attitude of being directed toward the first opening <b>3</b><i>e </i>of the oxide removing section <b>4</b> that is open at the melting surface <b>3</b><i>j </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). When the supply apparatus <b>2</b> is in operation, thread solder M that is fed out quantitatively from the thread solder feeding section <b>2</b><i>b </i>is guided through the guide path of the thread solder guide section <b>2</b><i>c </i>and let out from the opening at the bottom end so that its end facet contacts the melting surface <b>3</b><i>j </i>so as to close the first opening <b>3</b><i>e</i>. Note that the heating/melting means <b>3</b> is positioned at and rigidly secured to the securing member <b>2</b><i>j </i>of the moving means <b>2</b><i>e </i>in such a way that the thread solder M let out from the thread solder guide section <b>2</b><i>c </i>and the melting section <b>3</b><i>g </i>can maintain the above-described positional relationship (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0160">With the above-described configuration of the heating/melting means <b>3</b>, the thread solder M let out from the opening at the bottom end of the thread solder guide section <b>2</b><i>c </i>contacts and becomes molten by the melting surface <b>3</b><i>j </i>that is heated by the heater <b>3</b><i>c </i>to produce molten solder M<b>1</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>), the thread solder M contacts the melting surface <b>3</b><i>j </i>in such a way that its end facet closes the first opening <b>3</b><i>e </i>of the oxide removing section <b>4</b> formed with diameter &#xf8;<b>2</b> that is smaller than its diameter &#xf8;<b>1</b> and becomes molten to produce molten solder M<b>1</b>. Oxides E<b>2</b> produced as oxides E<b>1</b> produced on the outer peripheral surface of the thread solder M and driven to flow into the melting section <b>3</b><i>g </i>and oxides E<b>2</b> produced when the thread solder M is molten exist on the surface of the molten solder M<b>1</b>. However, oxides E<b>2</b> and clean molten solder M<b>1</b> that is located at a central part and does not contain oxides are separated from each other at an outer peripheral edge of the first opening <b>3</b><i>e </i>of the oxide removing section <b>4</b> so that the oxides E<b>2</b> are removed. Therefore, oxides E<b>2</b> are prevented from flowing into the flow path <b>3</b><i>d </i>at the melting surface <b>3</b><i>j </i>found along the outer peripheral edge of the first opening <b>3</b><i>e </i>and only clear molten solder M<b>1</b> that is not mixed with oxides E<b>2</b> flows into the flow path <b>3</b><i>d </i>through the first opening <b>3</b><i>e</i>. Furthermore, the inside of the flow path <b>3</b><i>d </i>from the first opening <b>3</b><i>e </i>to the second opening <b>3</b><i>f </i>is closed and a non-oxidizing atmosphere is contained there so that oxidation of the molten solder M<b>1</b> in the process of being supplied is suppressed and would not progress. Since the thickness of the layer of oxides E<b>1</b> produced on the surface of the thread solder M that is stored in the atmosphere is normally about tens of several micrometers, it is sufficient for the difference between the diameter of the thread solder M and the diameter of the first opening <b>3</b><i>e</i>, of &#xf8;<b>1</b>-&#xf8;<b>2</b>, to be about 1 mm, although the difference may be selected appropriately according to the low melting point metallic material to be supplied.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0161">As described above, the oxides E<b>2</b> that are prevented from flowing into the flow path <b>3</b><i>d </i>are stored in the storage section <b>3</b><i>k </i>and remain around the first opening <b>3</b><i>e</i>.

This is because molten solder M<b>1</b> can be supplied to the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> while progress of oxidation in the supply process that is conducted in the atmosphere, or in an oxidizing atmosphere, is suppressed due to the structure of the supply cylinder <b>9</b><i>a </i>of the supply apparatus <b>8</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0187" num="0190">The basic configuration of the heating/melting means <b>9</b> of this example resembles that of the above-described heating/melting means <b>3</b> but differs from the latter in terms of the structure of the supply cylinder and its attitude relative to the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. Namely, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>a</i>), a melting section <b>3</b><i>g </i>with which thread solder M contacts to produce molten solder M<b>1</b> is arranged at a right end section (an end section) of the supply cylinder <b>9</b><i>a </i>of the heating/melting means <b>9</b> and a substantially round tubular flow path <b>3</b><i>d </i>is arranged in the inside of the melting section <b>3</b><i>g </i>with an opening (a first opening) <b>3</b><i>e </i>located at oxide removing section <b>4</b> (cross-hatched part) arranged integrally with the melting section <b>3</b><i>g </i>and another opening (a second opening) <b>3</b><i>f </i>located at the left end facet of the melting section <b>3</b><i>g</i>. More specifically, the melting section <b>3</b><i>g </i>is formed at the right end of the top surface of the supply cylinder <b>9</b><i>a </i>to show a recessed profile and the first opening <b>3</b><i>e </i>is located at the bottom surface of the melting section <b>3</b><i>g </i>that is melting surface <b>3</b><i>j </i>which thread solder M contacts to melt, or the top surface of the oxide removing section <b>4</b>. The diameter &#xf8;B of the first opening <b>3</b><i>e </i>is less than the diameter &#xf8;A of the end facet of the thread solder M that contacts the melting surface <b>3</b><i>j </i>and the diameter &#xf8;C of the second opening <b>3</b><i>f </i>is not greater than the size g of the outer peripheral gap k between the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>.

<p id="p-0188" num="0191">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>10</b>(<i>c</i>) showing the area indicated by arrows C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>a</i>), a substantially flat plate-shaped guide section <b>9</b><i>b </i>that extends in a horizontal direction along the center axis of the flow path <b>3</b><i>d </i>is arranged in the supply cylinder <b>9</b><i>a </i>of Example No. 1-2. The guide section <b>9</b><i>b </i>has a projecting part <b>9</b><i>c </i>projecting by a predetermined length L from the second opening <b>3</b><i>f</i>. The projecting length L of the projecting part <b>9</b><i>c </i>depends on the width of the bonding section n to be formed and the thickness of the projecting part <b>9</b><i>c </i>is less than the size g of the outer peripheral gap k to be formed between the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. The guide section <b>9</b><i>b </i>has a function of smoothly supplying the molten solder M<b>1</b> flowing out from the second opening <b>3</b><i>f </i>to the outer peripheral gap k between the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>b</i>), which is a cross-sectional view taken along line B-B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>a</i>), the base end of the guide section <b>9</b><i>b </i>needs to be included in the second opening <b>3</b><i>f</i>. On the other hand, a gap that allows molten solder M<b>1</b> to flow out needs to be provided between the guide section <b>9</b><i>b </i>and the flow path <b>3</b><i>d </i>so that the guide section <b>9</b><i>b </i>may not obstruct the molten solder M<b>1</b> flowing out from the second opening <b>3</b><i>f</i>. Furthermore, to smoothly supply molten solder M<b>1</b> to the outer peripheral gap k, the front surface of the guide section <b>9</b><i>b </i>is preferably treated to improve its wettability relative to molten solder M<b>1</b> like the melting section <b>3</b><i>g </i>and the flow path <b>3</b><i>d</i>. While the supply cylinder <b>9</b><i>a </i>is described as having a guide section <b>9</b><i>b </i>in the supply apparatus <b>8</b> of this example, such a guide section is not an indispensable component in a case where molten solder wets glass substrates well and spreads smoothly between them because molten metal is highly wettable or because the size g of the outer peripheral gap k is relatively large.</p>

With this arrangement, the flow path <b>3</b><i>d </i>is directly connected to the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>2</b> into which molten solder M<b>1</b> is to be supplied and the molten solder M<b>1</b> flowing through the flow path <b>3</b><i>d </i>is filled into the outer peripheral gap k without being brought into contact with the surrounding atmosphere (oxygen) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>a</i>). Furthermore, because a guide section <b>9</b><i>b </i>is provided, the molten solder M<b>1</b> flowing out from the second opening <b>3</b><i>f </i>is highly smoothly filled into the outer peripheral gap k. The melting section <b>3</b><i>g </i>of the supply cylinder <b>9</b><i>a </i>has a configuration similar to the above-described supply cylinder <b>3</b><i>a </i>so that it may be needless to say that the oxides E<b>1</b> existing on the outer peripheral surface of the thread solder M<b>1</b> is prevented from being mixed into the molten solder M<b>1</b>.</p>

The oxides E<b>1</b> formed on the outer peripheral surface of the thread solder M are separated from the molten solder M<b>1</b> by the oxide removing section <b>4</b> and only clean molten solder M<b>1</b> that is not mixed with oxides E<b>1</b> flows into the flow path <b>3</b><i>d</i>.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the molten solder supply section <b>13</b> includes a supply cylinder <b>14</b>, a guide section <b>16</b> fitted to the front end of the supply cylinder <b>14</b> and a support section <b>15</b> that is a floating mechanism for supporting the supply cylinder <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0218">Firstly, the supply cylinder <b>14</b> will be described below. Of the supply cylinder <b>14</b>, reference symbol <b>14</b><i>h </i>denotes a cylinder body having a substantially hollow cylindrical shape whose left end has a reduced diameter. The cylinder body <b>14</b><i>h </i>has a surface (to be referred to as melting surface in Example No. 2-1 and Example No. 2-2 hereinafter) <b>14</b><i>e </i>disposed at a right top section of the cylinder body <b>14</b><i>h </i>and another surface (to be referred to as ejecting surface in Example No. 2-1 and Example No. 2-2 hereinafter) <b>14</b><i>f </i>disposed at a left end section and is arranged in such a way that the ejecting surface <b>14</b><i>f </i>can be positioned in parallel with the corresponding outer peripheral end facet of the unbonded body WO with a slight gap interposed between them. A pair of annular barriers <b>14</b><i>g </i>is formed at the supply cylinder <b>14</b> of this example with the melting surface <b>14</b><i>e </i>interposed between them and the bottom surface of the recessed section sandwiched by the two barriers <b>14</b><i>g </i>operates as melting surface <b>14</b><i>e</i>. The cylinder body <b>14</b><i>h </i>is preferably made of stainless steel or the like having a high thermal conductivity and a Cr layer is preferably formed on the melting surface <b>14</b><i>e </i>and also on the ejecting surface <b>14</b><i>f </i>in order to cause molten solder M<b>1</b> to smoothly flow because such a layer is highly wettable relative to molten solder M<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0219">Reference symbol <b>14</b><i>d </i>denotes a heating member wound around the outer peripheral surface of the cylinder body <b>14</b><i>h </i>disposed between the melting surface <b>14</b><i>e </i>and the ejecting surface <b>14</b><i>f </i>to heat the cylinder body <b>14</b><i>h </i>to not lower than the melting temperature of thread solder M. The heating member <b>14</b><i>d </i>is connected to a heating control section <b>12</b><i>a </i>for controlling the heating temperature and the heat emission pattern of the heating member <b>14</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0220">Reference symbol <b>14</b><i>c </i>denotes a flow path running through the inside of the cylinder body <b>14</b><i>h </i>and having a first opening <b>14</b><i>a </i>disposed at the melting surface <b>14</b><i>e </i>(to be referred to as flow-in port in Example No. 2-1 and Example No. 2-2 hereinafter) and a second opening <b>14</b><i>b </i>disposed at the ejecting surface <b>14</b><i>f </i>(to be referred to as ejection port in Example No. 2-1 and Example No. 2-2 hereinafter). The diameter, &#xf8;B of the flow-in port <b>14</b><i>a </i>is less than the diameter &#xf8;A of thread solder M. Note that the cross section of the flow path <b>14</b><i>c </i>is not limited to a circle and may, for example, be a rectangle.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0221">Preferably, a Cr layer that is highly wettable relative to molten solder M<b>1</b> is formed on the surface of the flow path <b>14</b><i>c </i>in order to cause molten solder M<b>1</b> to flow smoothly. Such a Cr layer may be replaced by a layer made of Al, Mo, W, V, Nb, Ta, Ag or Ni. Furthermore, the surface of the flow path <b>14</b><i>c </i>is preferably subjected to a nitriding treatment, which is an anti-corrosion treatment, so that the surface may not be corroded by molten solder M<b>1</b> and impurities may not be mixed into molten solder M<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0222">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18(</figref><i>a</i>), from which molten solder M<b>1</b> is omitted for the purpose of easy understanding, the diameter D<b>1</b>, of the ejection port <b>14</b><i>b </i>exceeds the size g of the outer peripheral gap k so that the molten solder M<b>1</b> that gets to the ejection port <b>14</b><i>b </i>also contacts the outer peripheral end facet of the first substrate w<b>3</b> and that of the second substrate w<b>4</b> and hence is supplied not only into the outer peripheral gap k but also to the outer peripheral end facets of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51(</figref><i>b</i>), a bonding section n that includes a projecting part n<b>1</b>, which tightly adheres to the outer peripheral end facets, is formed at the outer peripheral gap k of a glass panel W manufactured by using the ejection port <b>14</b><i>b </i>of this example.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0223">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(</figref><i>a</i>) illustrating supply cylinder <b>17</b>, from which molten solder M<b>1</b> is omitted for the purpose of easy understanding, the diameter D<b>1</b> of the ejection port <b>17</b><i>a </i>may be made to be not greater than the size g of the outer peripheral gap k. In the case of this example, the ejection port <b>17</b><i>a </i>is open only to the inside of the outer peripheral gap k so that the molten solder M<b>1</b> that gets to the ejection port <b>17</b><i>a </i>is filled only into the outer peripheral gap k. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51(</figref><i>c</i>), a bonding section n is formed only in the outer peripheral gap k of a glass panel W manufactured by using the supply cylinder <b>17</b> of this example. In the case of this mode of forming this ejection port <b>17</b><i>a</i>, the fluidity of molten solder M<b>1</b> can fall because its flow resistance rises when the flow path <b>14</b><i>c </i>is made to have a diameter D<b>1</b> that is same as the diameter of the ejection port <b>17</b><i>a </i>along all its length. Therefore, the flow path <b>14</b><i>c </i>preferably has a substantially conical profile and is tapered toward the ejecting surface <b>14</b><i>f </i>at an end part thereof so as to make the diameter of the ejection port <b>17</b><i>a </i>not greater than the size g of the outer peripheral gap k at the ejecting surface <b>14</b><i>f </i>where molten solder M<b>1</b> is actually ejected.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0224">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the front end of the thread solder M is set in an attitude of being directed to the flow-in port <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the supply cylinder <b>14</b> in the thread solder guide section <b>11</b><i>f</i>. Thus, the front end surface of the thread solder M that is quantitatively fed out from the thread solder feeding section <b>11</b><i>e </i>contacts the melting surface <b>14</b><i>e </i>in an attitude of closing the flow-in port <b>14</b><i>a</i>. As the thread solder M contacts the melting surface <b>14</b><i>e </i>that is heated by the heating member <b>14</b><i>d</i>, the thread solder M melts to produce molten solder M<b>1</b>. The molten solder M<b>1</b> that flows in from the flow-in port <b>14</b><i>a </i>moves through the flow path <b>14</b><i>c </i>toward the left end and is ejected from the ejection port <b>14</b><i>b</i>. Note that the cylinder body <b>14</b><i>h </i>is positioned and secured to securing member <b>11</b><i>k </i>in such a way that the above-described positional relationship of the thread solder M fed out from the thread solder guide section <b>11</b><i>f </i>and the melting surface <b>14</b><i>e </i>can be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0225">As described above, in the supply apparatus <b>11</b> of the example, the supply cylinder <b>14</b> itself melts the solid thread solder M that is supplied from the thread solder supply means <b>11</b><i>d </i>to produce molten solder M<b>1</b>. Alternatively, however, an arrangement of causing molten solder to be pushed out from a container adapted to store solider in a molten state by its own weight or under pressure can be incorporated in the supply apparatus <b>11</b>. Likewise, another supply mechanism may be incorporated so long as such a mechanism is not against the object of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0226">Now, the guide section <b>16</b> will be described below. The guide section <b>16</b> is so formed as to be inserted into the outer peripheral gap k of unbonded body WO along a horizontal plane as shown by arrow Y<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> in a direction of heading from the outer peripheral end facet of the unbonded body WO toward the inside thereof (to be referred to as inserting direction hereinafter) to guide and supply the molten solder M<b>1</b> ejected from the ejection port <b>14</b><i>b </i>of the supply cylinder <b>14</b> to the outer peripheral gap k. Therefore, the guide section <b>16</b> is fitted into a fitting groove formed at about a center part of the ejecting surface <b>14</b><i>f </i>in the direction of the Z-axis so as to cross the ejection port <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0227">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref> illustrating the guide section <b>16</b> in detail, reference symbol <b>16</b><i>h </i>denotes a thin plate-like trowel section having a small thickness T<b>2</b> relative to the size g of the outer peripheral gap k and projecting from the ejecting surface <b>14</b><i>f </i>of the supply cylinder <b>14</b> by length L<b>2</b>. The trowel section <b>16</b> includes a top surface (first plane surface) <b>16</b><i>i </i>facing the main surface S<b>1</b> of the first substrate w<b>3</b> of unbonded body WO placed on the mounting means <b>11</b><i>a </i>with a predetermined first gap G<b>1</b> interposed between them and a bottom surface (second plane surface) <b>16</b><i>j </i>facing the main surface S<b>2</b> of the second substrate w<b>4</b> with a predetermined second gap G<b>2</b> interposed between them. In this example, the first gap G<b>1</b> and the second gap G<b>2</b> are substantially of a same size. With a trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>having the above-described structure, the molten solder M<b>1</b> supplied to the outer peripheral gap k by way of the ejection port <b>14</b><i>b </i>is injected to the top surface <b>16</b><i>i </i>and bottom surface <b>16</b><i>j </i>of the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>to wet and spread between the gaps G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b>. However, the wetting and spreading of the molten solder M<b>1</b> is limited to the front end (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> and the left end in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18(</figref><i>a</i>)). Therefore, the width of the supplied molten solder M<b>1</b> from the outer edge of the unbonded body WO is limited to the length L<b>2</b> of the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h</i>. As the molten solder supply section <b>13</b> is moved horizontally along the outer edge of the unbonded body WO in a state where molten solder M<b>1</b> is filled in the gaps G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b>, the molten solder M<b>1</b> supplied to the gaps G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b> is forced to flow by the horizontal move of the molten solder supply section <b>13</b> and thus molten solder M<b>1</b> is applied to the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> and filled into the outer peripheral gap k along the outer edge of the unbonded body WO with a constant width due to the flowing molten solder M<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0228">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 16</figref>, an ultrasonic oscillation section <b>12</b><i>b </i>for transmitting ultrasonic waves to the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>is incorporated in the supply apparatus <b>11</b> of this example as a preferable arrangement so as to apply ultrasonic waves to the contact interfaces of the molten solder M<b>1</b> filled in the gaps G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b> and the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>, activate the molten solder M<b>1</b> in order to make it fit well with the contact interfaces and remove the air bubbles and the foreign objects existing at the contact interfaces. More preferably, ultrasonic waves are applied so as to oscillate the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>along the inserting direction of the guide section <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0229">Preferably, a layer made of Cr, Al, Mo, W, V, Nb, Ag, Ni or Ta is arranged on the top surface <b>16</b><i>i </i>and also on the bottom surface <b>16</b><i>j </i>of the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>in order to improve the wettability thereof relative to molten solder M<b>1</b>. Furthermore, the top and bottom surfaces <b>16</b><i>i </i>and <b>16</b><i>j </i>of the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>are preferably subjected to a nitriding treatment, which is an anti-corrosion treatment, so that they may not be corroded by molten solder M<b>1</b> and impurities may not be mixed into molten solder M<b>1</b>. Additionally, the top surface <b>16</b><i>i </i>and the bottom surface <b>16</b><i>j </i>of the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>are preferably provided with projections and recesses that intersect the moving direction of the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>in order to improve the follow-up performance of molten solder M<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0230">In the guide section <b>16</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, reference symbol <b>16</b><i>a </i>denotes a first contact section and reference symbol <b>16</b><i>f </i>denotes a second contact section. The first contact section <b>16</b><i>a </i>is formed by a pair of projecting bodies <b>16</b><i>b </i>and <b>16</b><i>c </i>projecting from the top surface <b>16</b><i>i </i>of the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h</i>. Each of the projecting bodies <b>16</b><i>b </i>and <b>16</b><i>c </i>has a first contact surface <b>16</b><i>d </i>that contacts the main surface S<b>1</b> of the first substrate w<b>3</b> in a state where the guide section <b>16</b> is inserted into the outer peripheral gap k and its length in the direction of the X-axis is L<b>1</b> as measured from the ejecting surface <b>14</b><i>f </i>of the supply cylinder <b>14</b> whereas its height in the direction of the Z-axis is substantially same as the size of the first gap G<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0231">Like the above-described first contact section <b>16</b><i>a</i>, the second contact section <b>16</b><i>f </i>is also formed by a pair of projecting bodies <b>16</b><i>m </i>and <b>16</b><i>l </i>projecting from the bottom surface <b>16</b><i>j </i>of the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h</i>. Each of the projecting bodies <b>16</b><i>m </i>and <b>16</b><i>l </i>has a second contact surface <b>16</b><i>g </i>that contacts the main surface S<b>2</b> of the second substrate w<b>4</b> in a state where the guide section <b>16</b> is inserted into the outer peripheral gap k and its length is L<b>1</b> which is same as the first contact section <b>16</b><i>a </i>whereas its height is substantially same as the size of the second gap G<b>2</b>. Note that the first contact surfaces <b>16</b><i>d </i>and the second contact surfaces <b>16</b><i>g </i>are made to show a semi-cylindrical profile that is round in the transversal direction of the guide section <b>16</b> (the direction orthogonal relative to direction of inserting the guide section <b>16</b> in the horizontal plane) in view of its relationship with the floating mechanism, which will be described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0232">The contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>f </i>having the above-described configuration will be described in greater detail below. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the thickness of the guide section <b>16</b> where the contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>f </i>are formed is T<b>1</b>, which is the sum of the thickness T<b>2</b> of the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>and the heights of the contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>f </i>(the height from the top surface <b>16</b><i>i </i>of the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>to the first contact surfaces <b>16</b><i>d </i>and the height from the bottom surface <b>16</b><i>j </i>of the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>to the second contact surfaces <b>16</b><i>g</i>). The thickness T<b>1</b> is substantially equal to or slightly less than the size g of the outer peripheral gap k so that the contact sections <b>16</b><i>e </i>and <b>16</b><i>f </i>can slide in the outer peripheral gap k, respectively contacting the main surfaces S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> of the glass substrates. Thus, as the guide section <b>16</b> is inserted into the outer peripheral gap k, the contact surfaces <b>16</b><i>d </i>and <b>16</b><i>g </i>respectively contact the main surfaces S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> and the guide section <b>16</b> is brought into a state of being fitted in the outer peripheral gap k.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0233">The height from the top surface <b>16</b><i>i </i>of the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>to the first contact surfaces <b>16</b><i>d </i>that is the height of the first contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>is equal to the gap G<b>1</b> and the height from the bottom surface <b>16</b><i>j </i>of the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>to the second contact surfaces <b>16</b><i>g </i>that is the height of the second contact sections <b>16</b><i>f </i>is equal to the gap G<b>2</b>. Thus, as a result, when the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>is inserted into the outer peripheral gap k, it is positioned in the direction of the Z-axis to produce the first gap G<b>1</b> and the second gap G<b>2</b>. Then, as the molten solder supply section <b>13</b> is moved horizontally along the corresponding outer peripheral end facet of the unbonded body WO so as to supply molten solder M<b>1</b> into the outer peripheral gap k, the guide section <b>16</b> moves while the contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>f </i>constantly and respectively sliding on the main surfaces S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> so that the size of the first gap G<b>1</b> and that of the second gap G<b>2</b> are held to a constant value.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0234">While the height of the first contact section <b>16</b><i>a </i>and that of the second contact section <b>16</b><i>f</i>, or the size of the first gap G<b>1</b> and that of the second gap G<b>2</b>, are equal to each other in this example, the sizes may be appropriately defined according to the characteristics of molten solder M<b>1</b> and may be made different relative to each other. If such is a case, the first gap G<b>1</b> is preferably made larger than the second gap G<b>2</b> because the supplied molten solder M<b>1</b> flows down by gravity.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0235">Preferably, the first contact surfaces <b>16</b><i>d </i>and the second contact surfaces <b>16</b><i>g </i>are subjected to an Ni water-repellent plating process and a surface smoothing process in order to improve their slidability relative to glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(</figref><i>a</i>), illustrating an exemplar modified guide section of the guide section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>f </i>may respectively be provided with recessed sections <b>17</b><i>c </i>and <b>17</b><i>d </i>at intermediate parts thereof as viewed in the inserting direction of the guide section <b>16</b>. As such recessed sections <b>17</b><i>c </i>and <b>17</b><i>d </i>are provided respectively in the contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>f </i>to reduce the contact areas relative to the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> so as to reduce the slide resistance, the molten solder supply section <b>13</b> can be moved smoothly and suppress any possible damage that the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> may have. If necessary, the contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>f </i>may respectively be made to be brought into point contact with the main surfaces S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0236">Additionally and preferably, in order to facilitate insertion of the unbonded body WO into the outer peripheral gap k, a C face or an R face is formed at each of the angled parts produced by one of the surfaces C<b>1</b> facing the corresponding outer peripheral end facet of the unbonded body WO and one of the related lateral surfaces C<b>2</b> in the inserting direction Y<b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. Such C faces or R faces can be formed by cutting, grinding or etching the angled parts produced by the surfaces C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0237">Additionally, as will be described in detail for the supply apparatus of Example No. 2-2, the contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>f </i>preferably are provided with elasticity that allows them to be flexed by a certain quantity in the direction of the Z-axis in order to accommodate variances of the position and the size of the outer peripheral gap k of unbonded body WO.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0238">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, reference symbol <b>16</b><i>e </i>denotes a first guide groove formed at the top part of the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>and reference symbol <b>16</b><i>k </i>denotes a second guide groove formed at the bottom part of the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h</i>. The guide grooves <b>16</b><i>e </i>and <b>16</b><i>k </i>are formed as rectangular grooves respectively between the projecting bodies <b>16</b><i>b </i>and <b>16</b><i>c </i>of the contact section <b>16</b><i>a </i>and between the projecting bodies <b>16</b><i>m </i>and <b>16</b><i>l </i>of the contact section <b>16</b><i>f </i>in the transversal direction of the guide section <b>16</b> in order to smoothly guide the molten solder M<b>1</b> ejected from the ejection port <b>14</b><i>b </i>of the supply cylinder <b>14</b> to the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h</i>. In other words, the guide grooves <b>16</b><i>e </i>and <b>16</b><i>k </i>are arranged so as to divide the contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>f </i>along the respective centers. The guide grooves <b>16</b><i>e </i>and <b>16</b><i>k </i>directly links the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>and the ejection port <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0239">While the profile of the guide grooves <b>16</b><i>e </i>and <b>16</b><i>k </i>including the cross section, the width and the depth thereof may be defined appropriately according to the fluidity of molten solder M<b>1</b>, preferably, in order to smoothly guide molten solder M<b>1</b> to the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h</i>, the bottom surface of the guide groove <b>16</b><i>e </i>is made to be flush with the top surface <b>16</b><i>i </i>of the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>and the bottom surface of the guide groove <b>16</b><i>k </i>is made to be flush with the bottom surface <b>16</b><i>j </i>of the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>so as not to produce any step at the connecting sections of the guide grooves <b>16</b><i>e </i>and <b>16</b><i>k </i>and the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h</i>. Furthermore, a layer made of Cr, Al, Mo, W, V, Nb, Ta, Ag or Ni is formed on the inner surface of each of the guide grooves <b>16</b><i>e </i>and <b>16</b><i>k </i>in order to improve the wettability thereof relative to molten solder M<b>1</b> and the inner surfaces are subjected to a nitriding treatment, which is an anti-corrosion treatment so that the inner surfaces may not be corroded by molten solder M<b>1</b> and no impurity may be mixed into molten solder M<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0240">The configuration of the guide grooves is not limited to the mode of realization shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>. Alternatively, in the case of guide <b>18</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>b</i>) contact sections <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>d </i>may be arranged at a central part of the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>in the transversal direction of the trowel section so as to provide upper two guide grooves <b>18</b><i>b </i>and <b>18</b><i>c </i>at the lateral sides of the contact section <b>18</b><i>a </i>and lower two guide grooves <b>18</b><i>e </i>and <b>18</b><i>f </i>at the lateral sides of the contact section <b>18</b><i>d </i>to make the ejection port <b>14</b><i>b </i>communicate with the top surface <b>16</b><i>i </i>and the bottom surface <b>16</b><i>j. </i></p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0241">While the trowel section and the contact sections may be formed as an integral structure, the trowel section and the contact sections have different functions and are required to have different characteristics. Therefore, as in the case of guide section <b>19</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> for example, the trowel section <b>19</b><i>f </i>may be formed by using a material that is highly wettable relative to molten solder M<b>1</b> and the contact sections <b>19</b><i>a </i>and <b>19</b><i>c </i>may be formed by using a wear-resistant material that is highly slidable on glass substrates. Then, the guide section may be produced by assembling the trowel section <b>19</b><i>f </i>and the contact sections <b>19</b><i>a </i>and <b>19</b><i>b </i>that are separate from each other by bonding them or by means of screws or the like. Still alternatively, the trowel section and/or the contact sections may be formed integrally with the ejecting surface of the supply cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0242">Now, the support section <b>15</b> that is incorporated into the supply apparatus <b>11</b> of this example as a preferable arrangement will be described below by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>. The support section <b>15</b> of this example indirectly supports the guide section <b>16</b> by way of the supply cylinder <b>14</b> and operates as a floating mechanism that swings the guide section <b>16</b>, following the force acting on the guide section <b>16</b> only in the direction of the Z-axis (the direction of the thickness of the outer peripheral gap k) and around the center axis of the supply cylinder <b>14</b> (the insertion axis of the guide section <b>16</b>) (without moving the guide section <b>16</b> in a horizontal plane).

The small diameter section <b>15</b><i>i </i>is supported by bearing <b>15</b><i>j </i>arranged on bearing member <b>15</b><i>f </i>so as to make the support member <b>15</b><i>g </i>rotatable around the center axis of the supply cylinder <b>14</b>.

<p id="p-0241" num="0244">The support section <b>15</b> having the above-described structure operates in a manner as described below. When, for example, the position of the outer peripheral gap k of unbonded body WO along the Z-axis is shifted as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> probably because the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are combined or the table moving section <b>11</b><i>c </i>is driven to move only at an unsatisfactory level of accuracy, force of a predetermined magnitude acts on the guide section <b>16</b> around the center axis of the supply cylinder <b>14</b> or in the direction of the Z-axis by way of the contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>f </i>that are respectively held in contact with the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. The force acting around the center axis of the supply cylinder <b>14</b> is transmitted to the support member <b>15</b><i>g </i>by way of the supply cylinder <b>14</b>.

<p id="h-0048" num="0000">[Atmosphere Control Means]</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0248">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the atmosphere control means <b>11</b><i>r </i>includes a gas supply section <b>11</b><i>t </i>that is equipped with a supply pump and can supply predetermined gas under predetermined pressure, a vacuum pump <b>11</b><i>u </i>for producing a vacuum condition in the airtight space <b>11</b><i>n </i>of the airtight chamber <b>111</b> and piping <b>11</b><i>s </i>for connecting the gas supply section <b>11</b><i>t</i>, the vacuum pump <b>11</b><i>u </i>and the airtight space <b>11</b><i>n </i>to control the airtight space <b>11</b><i>n </i>so as to make it have a predetermined atmosphere. Note that the gas supply section <b>11</b><i>t </i>can separately contain gases of a plurality of different kinds to be used selectively according to the application of the glass panel including, for example, argon gas and nitrogen gas, which are inert gases, hydrogen gas and carbon monoxide gas, which are reducing gases, and oxygen gas, which is an oxidizing gas. The gas supply section <b>11</b><i>t </i>can also mix any of such gases to a predetermined ratio and supply the mixture gas to the airtight space <b>11</b><i>n </i>by means of the mixing valve with which the gas supply section <b>11</b><i>t </i>is equipped.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0249">Now, the operation of the supply apparatus <b>11</b> having the above-described configuration will be described below. First, a preparation step comes. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, unbonded body WO having main surfaces S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> that face each other by way of a predetermined gap interposed between them by the gap maintaining member Q is placed at a predetermined position on the table <b>11</b><i>b </i>in a horizontal attitude. Then, the supply apparatus <b>11</b> is started. The supply apparatus <b>11</b> brings the airtight space <b>11</b><i>n </i>into an airtight state and exhausts air by means of the vacuum pump <b>11</b><i>u </i>to bring the inside of the airtight space <b>11</b><i>n </i>into a vacuum condition. Thereafter, the supply apparatus <b>11</b> supplies gas that contains oxygen to a predetermined ratio from the gas supply section <b>11</b><i>t </i>to the airtight space <b>11</b><i>n </i>to produce an atmosphere where molten solder M<b>1</b> that is SnAgAl based solder containing easily oxidizable elements can be bonded to glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> with ease. Additionally, the supply apparatus <b>11</b> makes the heat emitting body contained in the table <b>11</b><i>b </i>emit heat to heat the unbonded body WO to about the melting temperature of molten solder M<b>1</b> and causes the ultrasonic oscillation section <b>12</b><i>b </i>to oscillate in order to transmit ultrasonic waves to be applied to molten solder M<b>1</b> to the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h. </i></p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0250">Next comes a supply cylinder positioning step. The supply apparatus <b>11</b> lowers the lifting shaft <b>11</b><i>j </i>by means of the lifting section <b>11</b><i>i </i>and, if necessary, slues it to place the molten solder supply section <b>13</b> at a predetermined position. When the molten solder supply section <b>13</b> is positioned properly, the molten solder supply section <b>13</b> is placed at positions where the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>of the guide section <b>16</b> can be inserted into the outer peripheral gap k of the unbonded body WO in the direction of the Z-axis and where the ejecting surface <b>14</b><i>f </i>of the supply cylinder <b>14</b> is held in parallel with the corresponding outer peripheral end facet of the unbonded body WO in the direction of the O-axis. Subsequently, the supply apparatus <b>11</b> places the unbonded body WO at a predetermined position by horizontally moving the table moving section <b>11</b><i>c </i>so that the ejecting surface <b>14</b><i>f </i>of the supply cylinder <b>14</b> and the corresponding outer peripheral end facet of the unbonded body WO face each other by way of a slight gap interposed between them. The guide section <b>16</b> is inserted into the outer peripheral gap k of the unbonded body WO in the process where the unbonded body WO is positioned in a horizontal plane. Since the a C face or an R face is formed at each of the angled parts of the contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>f </i>of the guide section <b>16</b> as described above, the contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>f </i>are smoothly inserted into the outer peripheral gap k. Furthermore, since the guide section <b>16</b> is supported by the support section <b>15</b> that is a floating mechanism, if the center of the outer peripheral gap k and that of the guide section <b>16</b> are displaced relative to each other in the direction of the Z-axis, for example, the guide section <b>16</b> moves vertically to compensate the displacement and the contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>f </i>are inserted into the outer peripheral gap k. When the operation of positioning the unbonded body WO is completed, the contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>f </i>are respectively held in contact with the main surfaces S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> so that the guide section <b>16</b> is held in a state of being fitted into the outer peripheral gap k and the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>is positioned substantially at the center of the outer peripheral gap k in the direction of the Z-axis and gaps G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b> are produced between the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> and the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h. </i></p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0251">Then comes a molten solder supply step. The supply apparatus <b>11</b> drives the motor of the thread solder feeding section <b>11</b><i>e </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> to let out thread solder M from the bottom end of the thread solder guide section <b>11</b><i>f</i>. The let out thread solder M contacts the melting surface <b>14</b><i>e </i>of the supply cylinder <b>14</b> that is heated by the heating member <b>14</b><i>d </i>to a temperature not lower than the melting temperature of thread solder M to produce molten solder M<b>1</b>. If oxides are formed at the outer peripheral surface of the thread solder M, the oxides are separated and removed by the outer peripheral edge of the flow-in port <b>14</b><i>a</i>, or the melting surface <b>14</b><i>e</i>, because the diameter &#xf8;B of the flow-in port <b>14</b><i>a </i>that is open at the melting surface <b>14</b><i>e </i>is smaller than the diameter &#xf8;A of thread solder M. As a result, the oxides are prevented from entering the flow path <b>14</b><i>c </i>and clean molten solder M<b>1</b> that is substantially not mixed with oxides flows into the flow path <b>14</b><i>c</i>. Thereafter, the supply apparatus <b>11</b> continuously feeds out thread solder M at a predetermined rate and supplies molten solder M<b>1</b> to the flow path <b>14</b><i>c </i>until the filling operation is completed. Since the oxide layer formed on the surface of thread solder M that is stored in the atmosphere is normally about tens of several &#x3bc;m, it is sufficient to make the difference between the diameter of the thread solder M and that of the flow-in port <b>14</b><i>a </i>(&#xf8;A&#x2212;&#xf8;B) equal to about 1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0252">The oxides removed at the melting surface <b>14</b><i>e </i>in the above-described supply step is accumulated around the flow-in port <b>14</b><i>e</i>, while its move is restricted by the barriers <b>14</b><i>g</i>, and subsequently pushed to flow by the following oxides to eventually get to the bottom surface of the supply cylinder <b>14</b>, where it is collected by a collection means (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0253">The molten solder M<b>1</b> that flows into the flow path <b>14</b><i>c </i>as described above is ejected from the ejection port <b>14</b><i>b </i>and flows through the upper and lower guide grooves <b>16</b><i>e </i>and <b>16</b><i>k </i>of the guide section <b>16</b> and injected into the first gap G<b>1</b> and the second gap G<b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The molten solder M<b>1</b> supplied from the supply cylinder <b>14</b> passes through the guide grooves <b>16</b><i>e </i>and <b>16</b><i>k </i>and supplied into the gaps G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b> in a state where the molten solder M<b>1</b> is substantially sealed by the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> and the ejecting surface <b>14</b><i>f </i>so as not to contact oxygen. Therefore, molten solder M<b>1</b> is applied to the main surfaces S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> in a state where oxidation of the surface of the molten solder M<b>1</b> is suppressed to make it possible to raise the quality of the sealed glass panel.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0254">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the supply apparatus <b>11</b> horizontally moves the unbonded body WO by driving the table moving section <b>11</b><i>c </i>to run in the direction of the X-axis or the Y-axis at a constant speed so as to cause the guide section <b>16</b> to make a full turn around the outer peripheral edge of the unbonded body WO and along a rectangular frame-like track, while maintaining the positional relationship between the molten solder supply section <b>13</b> and the unbonded body WO in a horizontal direction. Then, the molten solder M<b>1</b> supplied to the gaps G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b> wets the respective main surfaces S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> and becomes filled into the outer peripheral gap k with a width equal to the length L<b>2</b> of the guide section <b>16</b> as the molten solder M<b>1</b> is applied to the main surfaces S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> that is an enlarged partial plan view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the supply apparatus <b>11</b> combines the operation of controlling the move of the unbonded body WO in the directions of the X- and Y-axes by the table moving section <b>11</b><i>c </i>and the operation of controlling the move of the molten solder supply section <b>13</b> in the direction of the &#x3b8;-axis by the lifting shaft <b>11</b><i>j </i>to move the guide section <b>16</b> horizontally along an arc-shaped track at the four corners of the unbonded body WO so as to fill molten solder M<b>1</b> into the outer peripheral gap k also at the four corners.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0255">While the guide section <b>16</b> is moving horizontally in the above-described supply step, the contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>f </i>are constantly and respectively held in contact with the main surfaces S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> and the move of the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>in the direction of the Z-axis is restricted by the contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>f</i>. Then, as a result, the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>does not touch the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> so that no damage that can adversely affect the bonding performance of the bonding section n relative to the main surfaces S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> thereof would be produced on the main surfaces S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>. Furthermore, the sizes of the gaps G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b> between the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> and the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>that are an important factor for applying molten solder M<b>1</b> well to the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are maintained by the contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>f </i>projecting from the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>to a height that is determined as a function of the gaps G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b> during the supply step. As a result, uniform bonding strength can be realized for the bonding section n relative to the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0256">Additionally, since the guide section <b>16</b> is supported by the support section <b>15</b> that is a floating mechanism, the guide section <b>16</b> moves up and down, following the vertical positional fluctuations of the outer peripheral gap k that can take place when the unbonded body WO moves such as when the outer peripheral gap k of the unbonded body WO undulates as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22(</figref><i>a</i>) or when the moving path of the table moving section <b>11</b><i>c </i>is inclined by angle &#x3c1; relative to the outer peripheral gap k as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22(</figref><i>b</i>). Then, as a result, the gaps G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b> between the guide section <b>16</b> and the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are held to a constant value.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0257">Still additionally, as ultrasonic waves are applied to the contact interfaces of the molten solder M<b>1</b> filled in the gaps G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b> by way of the guide section <b>16</b> and the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the wettability of the molten solder M<b>1</b> relative to the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> is raised so that molten solder M<b>1</b> is sufficiently supplied into the narrow gaps G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b>. Furthermore, the air bubbles and the foreign objects such as oxide film existing at the contact interfaces are removed by ultrasonic vibrations to enhance the bonding strength of the bonding section relative to the glass substrates of the glass panel that is finished as product.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0258">After the above-described supply step is completed and molten solder M<b>1</b> is filled into all the outer peripheral gap k defined along the four sides of the unbonded body WO, the filled molten solder M<b>1</b> is cooled and solidified in a molten solder cooling step to form a bonding section and the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are bonded to each other to produce a glass panel W. The cooling step may be conducted by suspending the heat emission of the heating body while the unbonded body WO is placed on the table <b>11</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> or by removing the unbonded body WO from the table <b>11</b><i>b </i>and moving it to some other place. From the viewpoint of automating the process of manufacturing glass panels, preferably the table <b>11</b><i>b </i>is made removable from the table moving section <b>11</b><i>c </i>and the table <b>11</b><i>b </i>itself on which an unbonded body WO is placed is made replaceable for each supply step.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0259">As an example, the contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>f </i>are arranged at the rear end side of the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>as viewed in the direction Y<b>1</b> of inserting the guide section <b>16</b> in the above-described supply apparatus <b>11</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>. The arrangement of the guide section <b>16</b> of this example is advantageous when the contact sections need to be driven to slide outside the bonding section in order to protect a wiring pattern as in the case of a glass panel where the wiring pattern to be incorporated in a flat type image display apparatus is formed inside the bonding section, for example. On the other hand, the bonding performance of the bonding section existing on the parts of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> where the contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>f </i>respectively slide on the glass substrates will be inferior to that of the bonding section existing on the parts where the contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>f </i>do not slide on the respective glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. Then, the bonding section existing on the former parts will be good for nothing so that a wide bonding section may need to be formed for compensation.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0260">Therefore, when a relatively narrow bonding section needs to be formed, a guide section <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> as an example is preferably employed. In the case of the guide section shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, contact sections <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>c </i>are arranged at the front end of the trowel section <b>20</b><i>e </i>as viewed in the direction Y<b>1</b> of inserting the guide section <b>20</b>. Note that, in this example, the molten solder M<b>1</b> ejected from the ejection port <b>14</b><i>b </i>of the supply cylinder <b>14</b> is directly supplied to the trowel section <b>20</b><i>e </i>so that no guide grooves are provided. When this guide section <b>20</b> is employed, the trowel section <b>20</b><i>e </i>does not contact the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> and the supplied molten solder M<b>1</b> wets and spreads on the top surface and the bottom surface of the trowel section <b>20</b><i>e </i>and becomes filled into the gaps between the glass substrates as in the case of the above-described guide section <b>16</b> but the extent of wetting and spreading of molten solder M<b>1</b> is limited by the contact sections <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>c </i>so that molten solder can be filled with a relatively narrow width from the outer edges of the unbonded body. Additionally, as the extent of wetting and spreading of molten solder is limited by the contact sections <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>c</i>, molten solder can be filled into the outer peripheral gap with a substantially constant width along the outer edges of the unbonded body.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0261">Furthermore, while the first contact section <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the second contact section <b>16</b><i>f </i>are brought into contact with the respective main surfaces S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> of the first substrate w<b>3</b> and the second substrate w<b>4</b> simultaneously when the guide section <b>16</b> of the above-described supply apparatus <b>11</b> is inserted into the outer peripheral gap k as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, the contact sections <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>may be normally held way from the respective main surfaces S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> without contacting them and brought into contact with the respective glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>3</b> only when necessary as in the case of the guide section <b>21</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. More specifically, the guide section <b>21</b> has a basic structure substantially same as the guide section <b>16</b> and has a trowel section <b>16</b><i>h</i>, a first contact section <b>21</b><i>a </i>projecting from the top surface of the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>and a second contact section <b>21</b><i>b </i>projecting from the bottom surface of the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>but the thickness T<b>1</b> of the part of the guide section <b>21</b> located at the contact sections <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>is less than the size g of the outer peripheral gap k as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24(</figref><i>a</i>). Therefore, when the guide section <b>21</b> is inserted into the outer peripheral gap k, the first contact section <b>21</b><i>a </i>faces the main surface S<b>1</b> of the first substrate w<b>3</b> with a first void gap interposed between them and the second contact section <b>21</b><i>b </i>faces the main surface S<b>2</b> of the second substrate w<b>4</b> with a second void gap interposed between them so that the contact sections <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>do not contact the respective main surfaces S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> when the guide section <b>21</b> is inserted. With such a guide section <b>21</b>, if the position of the guide section <b>21</b> relatively shifts in the direction of arrow Z<b>1</b> along the Z-axis during a molten metal supply step as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24(</figref><i>b</i>), the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>is restricted by the contact sections <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>so that the trowel section <b>16</b><i>h </i>does not contact the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> and the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are prevented from being damaged to consequently enhance the bonding quality of the bonding section.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0262">The above-described floating mechanism incorporated into the support section is not necessarily needed. Besides, the contact surfaces of the contact sections of the guide section may be made flat surfaces and only a contact section may be formed on one of the surfaces of the trowel section. With such an arrangement, the glass substrates are prevented from being damaged to consequently enhance the sealing performance of the bonding section of the finished glass panel due to the effect of avoiding any contact between the main surfaces of the glass substrates and the trowel section when the outer peripheral gap of the unbonded body shows a high degree of dimensional accuracy and/or when the table moving section shows a high degree of running accuracy.</p>

<p id="p-0260" num="0263">Now, a molten metal supply cylinder and a molten metal supply apparatus incorporating such a supply cylinder will be described below as Example No. 2-2 of the present invention by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</figref>. Note that the supply apparatus of Example No. 2-2 has a configuration substantially same as the supply apparatus <b>11</b> described above by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> and differs from the latter only in terms of molten solder supply section. Therefore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</figref> show only parts related to the molten solder supply section and the other components are omitted. Additionally, the components same as those of the supply apparatus <b>11</b> are denoted respectively by the same reference symbols and their structures and operations will not be described in detail any further.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0264">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the molten solder supply section <b>22</b> of the supply apparatus of Example No. 2-2 has a supply cylinder <b>23</b> having a configuration substantially same as the supply cylinder <b>14</b> and a guide section <b>22</b><i>a </i>arranged at the front end of support member <b>22</b><i>d </i>connected to a simple support section that does not operate as floating mechanism. In a supply step, the supply cylinder <b>23</b> is arranged in front of the guide section <b>22</b><i>a </i>in a state of being separated from the guide section <b>22</b><i>a </i>as viewed in the moving direction of the molten solder supply section <b>22</b> as indicated by arrow X<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. The feed pipe <b>23</b><i>a </i>having an outer diameter that allows it to be inserted into the outer peripheral gap k of an unbonded body WO is arranged at the front end of the supply cylinder <b>23</b> to supply molten solder M<b>1</b> into the outer peripheral gap k in front of the guide section <b>22</b><i>a </i>as viewed in the moving direction. A plurality of such feed pipes <b>23</b><i>a </i>may be arranged or a feed pipe having an elliptic cross section or a rectangular cross section may be employed. While the depth by which the feed pipe <b>23</b><i>a </i>is inserted may be determined as a function of the width of the bonding section to be formed, it is effective to use a plurality of feed pipes that can be inserted by different depths when a wide bonding section is to be formed. Preferably the feed pipe <b>23</b><i>a </i>is coated with resin on the surface thereof or made of a soft material so as not to damage the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> when the feed pipe <b>23</b><i>a </i>is brought into contact with them.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0265">The guide section <b>22</b><i>a </i>of this example has elasticity that allows it to be flexed in the direction of the Z-axis that is the direction of the thickness of the outer peripheral gap k or around the center axis of the supply cylinder <b>23</b> instead of a floating mechanism that the supply apparatus of Example No. 2-1 has. More specifically, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the upper and lower contact sections <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>c </i>of the guide section <b>22</b><i>a </i>are made of an elastic material such as metal or resin so as to make the contact sections <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>c </i>flexible so that, when the position of the outer peripheral gap k shifts, the contact sections <b>22</b><i>b </i>and <b>22</b><i>c </i>are flexed and can follow the shift. An elastic layer may be arranged on the contact surfaces of the contact sections <b>22</b><i>b </i>and <b>22</b><i>c </i>that are respectively to be brought into contact with the main surfaces S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> of glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> if all the contact sections <b>22</b><i>b </i>and <b>22</b><i>c </i>are not made of an electric material. Such an arrangement provides an advantage of simplifying structure of the supply apparatus. It is particularly advantageous when the position of the outer peripheral gap k of the unbonded body WO fluctuates only to a relatively small extent in the direction of the Z-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0266">The guide section <b>22</b><i>e </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26(</figref><i>a</i>) is a first exemplar modified guide section of the above-described guide section <b>22</b><i>a</i>.

In a molten solder supply step, the contact surfaces of the contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>f </i>of the guide section <b>22</b><i>e </i>where the respective elastic layers <b>22</b><i>f </i>and <b>22</b><i>g </i>are not formed respectively contact the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> but the elastic layers <b>22</b><i>f </i>and <b>22</b><i>g </i>do not directly contact them. Therefore, the guide section <b>22</b><i>a </i>can accommodate any shift of the position of the outer peripheral gap k by means of the elastic layers <b>22</b><i>f </i>and <b>22</b><i>g </i>in a manner as described above. This arrangement is also advantageous in that the contact sections <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>f </i>and the elastic layers <b>22</b><i>f </i>and <b>22</b><i>g </i>can be formed by using different suitable materials so that they may effectively operate to realize their respective functions.</p>

They project from the corresponding end facet of the support section <b>22</b><i>d </i>by a length of L<b>3</b>.

<p id="p-0268" num="0271">A molten metal supply cylinder according to (25) described above, a molten metal supply apparatus incorporating such a supply cylinder and a molten metal supply method will be described below by way of Examples No. 3-1 and No. 3-2 showing a desirable mode of carrying out the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0051" level="1">Example No. 3-1</heading>
<p id="p-0269" num="0272">A molten metal supply cylinder and a molten metal supply apparatus incorporating such a supply cylinder will be described below as Example No. 3-1 by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 through 30</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> is a partial cross-sectional view of the molten metal supply apparatus of this example, showing a principal part thereof and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</figref> are respectively a cross-sectional view and a partial perspective view of the supply cylinder <b>24</b> of this Example.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0273">Firstly, the molten metal supply apparatus will be described. The supply apparatus is designed to manufacture a glass panel W as described earlier by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 51(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>51</b>(<i>b</i>) and includes a supply cylinder <b>24</b>, a holder <b>24</b><i>a </i>to which the supply cylinder <b>24</b> is fitted, a floating mechanism <b>24</b><i>b </i>for making the holder <b>24</b><i>a </i>float mainly up and down and a casing <b>24</b><i>e </i>that supports the floating mechanism <b>24</b><i>b</i>. The floating mechanism <b>24</b><i>b </i>can be realized as a structure provided with upper and lower rubber pieces or springs showing an appropriate degree of resiliency so as to be able to allow the supply cylinder <b>24</b> to maintain its attitude without exerting excessive force to the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> or the supply cylinder <b>24</b>. Preferably, an ultrasonic vibrating body <b>24</b><i>c </i>fitted to the holder <b>24</b><i>a </i>is connected to the supply cylinder <b>24</b> by way of a shaft member <b>24</b><i>d </i>so as to longitudinally apply ultrasonic vibrations to the supply cylinder <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0274">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the supply cylinder <b>24</b> contains in the inside thereof a flow path <b>24</b><i>i </i>having a circular cross section flowed molten solder M<b>1</b> through and has a guide section <b>25</b> fitted thereto. The flow path <b>24</b><i>i </i>is open at one of the surfaces, or the surface <b>24</b><i>m</i>, and at the other surface, or the surface <b>24</b><i>n</i>, of the supply cylinder <b>24</b>. The guide section <b>25</b> is inserted into the flow path <b>24</b><i>i </i>by a depth of LO so as to extend orthogonally relative to the other surface <b>24</b><i>n</i>, crossing a second opening <b>24</b><i>h</i>. Thus, the supply cylinder <b>24</b> supplies the molten solder M<b>1</b> discharged from the second opening <b>24</b><i>h </i>into the outer peripheral gap by way of the guide section <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0275">The supply apparatus inserts the guide section <b>25</b> of the supply cylinder <b>24</b> into the outer peripheral gap k of glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> so as to produce a state where the other surface <b>24</b><i>n </i>is separated from the corresponding outer peripheral end facets of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> by a predetermined gap s and moves the supply cylinder <b>24</b> at a predetermined speed so as to make a full turn along the outer peripheral gap k. The supply apparatus may not necessarily be solely responsible for carrying out the move and the table on which the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are placed may be made to participate in the operation of carrying out the move so as to relatively move the supply cylinder and the glass substrates. In other words, the structure of the supply apparatus is variable and can be defined according to the mode of moving the supply cylinder. Regardless of the structure of the supply apparatus that is defined according to the mode of moving the supply cylinder, the mechanism for moving glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> and the mechanism for moving the supply apparatus can be realized by means of known techniques, for example by combining a motor and a ball screw or a linear guide for linear movements and combining a motor or a cylinder and a bearing for revolving movements. The casing <b>24</b><i>e </i>may well be fitted to a moving mechanism by way of a jig or the like for adjusting its vertical position. With the above-described arrangement, the height of the guide section <b>25</b> can be adjusted relative to the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> by seeing the thickness of the glass substrate w<b>4</b> and the height of the gap maintaining member Q.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0276">Now, the guide section <b>25</b> will be described in greater detail. The guide section <b>25</b> is adapted to be inserted into the outer peripheral gap k of glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> to supply the molten solder M<b>1</b> that is discharged from the second opening (to be referred to as discharge port in Example No. 3-1 and Example No. 3-2 hereafter) <b>24</b><i>h </i>of the supply cylinder <b>24</b> into the outer peripheral gap k. The guide section <b>25</b> causes the molten solder M<b>1</b> to slide on the main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> when it moves along the outer peripheral gap k. In other words, the guide section <b>25</b> supplies and applies molten solder M<b>1</b> into the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. Unlike the lead-in plate described in PTL 4 that is disposed at a center section of a molten solder discharge port so as to divide the discharge port into an upper part and a lower part and make them show an equal area, the guide section <b>25</b> is disposed at a vertically downwardly offset position as viewed from the center of the discharge port <b>24</b><i>h</i>, although the lead-in plate resembles the guide section of this example. Therefore, the area of the upper discharge port <b>24</b><i>j </i>partitioned by the guide section <b>25</b> is larger than the area of the lower discharge port <b>24</b><i>k. </i></p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0277">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the guide section <b>25</b> includes a plate-shaped body <b>25</b><i>c </i>having a thickness (T<b>2</b>) smaller than the size g of the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> and projecting bodies <b>25</b><i>a </i>projecting from the top and bottom surfaces of the plate-shaped body <b>25</b><i>c </i>and having a thickness (T<b>1</b>) substantially equal to the size g of the outer peripheral gap k. The plate-shaped body <b>25</b><i>c </i>is inserted into the outer peripheral gap k and molten solder M<b>1</b> is injected into the gaps between the surfaces of the plate shaped body <b>25</b><i>c </i>and the oppositely disposed glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> so as to apply molten solder M<b>1</b> to the main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. The part L<b>2</b> that is inserted into the outer peripheral gap k is referred to as trowel section <b>25</b><i>d </i>hereinafter. The projecting bodies <b>25</b><i>a </i>formed on the top and bottom surfaces of the plate-shaped body <b>25</b><i>c </i>are so formed as to project from the discharge port <b>24</b><i>h </i>by L<b>1</b>. The projecting bodies <b>25</b><i>a </i>has contact surfaces that can be inserted into the outer peripheral gap k and slide on the respective main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> and the parts where the contact surfaces are formed are referring to as contact sections <b>25</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0278">When the guide section <b>25</b> is inserted into the outer peripheral gap k, the vertical position of the trowel section <b>25</b><i>d </i>in the outer peripheral gap k is determined as the contact sections <b>25</b><i>b </i>are made to fit to the outer peripheral gap k. More specifically, as shown in FIG. <b>30</b>, the first gap Gu between the top surface of the trowel section <b>25</b><i>d </i>and the glass substrate w<b>3</b> and the second gap Ga between the bottom surface of the trowel section <b>25</b><i>d </i>and the glass substrate w<b>4</b> can be held to respective constant values. Note that the contact sections <b>25</b><i>b </i>are preferably subjected to a surface treatment, for example Ni water-repellent plating, in order to make them able to slide smoothly on the main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. Additionally, the contact sections <b>25</b><i>b </i>are preferably beveled to show bevels c at the lateral edges of the surfaces thereof that form steps relative to the trowel section <b>25</b><i>d </i>so that they may be smoothly put into the outer peripheral gap k. The bevels c can be formed by producing straight or round slopes at the related edges by cutting, grinding or etching.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0279">The plate-shaped body <b>25</b><i>c </i>and the projecting bodies <b>25</b><i>a </i>may be formed as an integral structure or they may be separately formed and bonded or otherwise assembled together by securing them to each other by way of a bonding or laminating process. In the case of an assembled structure, appropriate materials can be selected and combined to meet the functional requirements of the plate-shaped body <b>25</b><i>c </i>and the projecting bodies <b>25</b><i>a</i>. For example, glass may be selected for the plate-shaped body <b>25</b><i>c </i>and metal may be selected for the projecting bodies <b>25</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0280">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>a</i>), the projecting bodies <b>25</b><i>a </i>formed on the top and bottom surfaces of the plate-shaped body <b>25</b><i>c </i>are formed so as to sandwich guide grooves <b>25</b><i>e </i>and <b>25</b><i>h </i>into which molten solder M<b>1</b> can flow from the flow path <b>24</b><i>i</i>. For example, the guide grooves <b>25</b><i>e </i>and <b>25</b><i>h </i>can be formed by cutting grooves to divide the projecting body <b>25</b><i>a </i>that are formed integrally with the plate-shaped body <b>25</b><i>c</i>. While the width and the depth of the guide grooves <b>25</b><i>e </i>and <b>25</b><i>h </i>may be determined according to the flowability of molten solder M<b>1</b>, a large width and a large depth are preferable for the flowability of molten solder M<b>1</b> and may be formed by cutting the plate-shaped body <b>25</b><i>c </i>so as to get into the trowel section <b>25</b><i>d </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(</figref><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0281">As described above, the trowel section <b>25</b><i>d </i>is provided for the purpose of injecting the molten solder M<b>1</b> supplied by way of the guide grooves <b>25</b><i>e </i>and <b>25</b><i>h </i>into the gaps Gu and Gd and making it to be firmly bonded to the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. Therefore, as the trowel section <b>25</b><i>d </i>moves, molten solder M<b>1</b> is filled into a part of the outer peripheral gap k located behind the trowel section <b>25</b><i>d </i>as viewed in the moving direction thereof by way of the gaps Gu and Gd and the width of the bonding section n is defined by the length L<b>2</b> of the trowel section <b>25</b><i>d</i>. The thickness T<b>2</b> of the trowel section <b>25</b><i>d </i>is selected on the basis of the size of the first gap Gu and the second gap Gd in such a way that molten solder M<b>1</b> can be applied to the main surfaces of the glass subs rates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>, while being held in contact with the main surfaces under uniform pressure. The gaps Gu and Gd are preferably narrow for the molten solder M<b>1</b> to move with the trowel section <b>25</b><i>d</i>, following the latter, and become applied to the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> well. One or more grooves intersecting the moving direction of the trowel section <b>25</b><i>d </i>may be formed on the surfaces of the trowel section <b>25</b><i>d </i>in order to improve the follow-up performance of the molten solder M<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0282">Now, the supply cylinder <b>24</b> will be described in detail below. The supply cylinder <b>24</b> supplies molten solder M<b>1</b> from the first opening <b>24</b><i>g </i>formed on the one surface <b>24</b><i>m </i>and discharges the molten solder M<b>1</b> from the discharge port <b>24</b><i>h </i>that is the second opening formed on the other surface <b>24</b><i>n</i>. The molten solder M<b>1</b> supplied to the first opening <b>24</b><i>g </i>is produced, for example, as thread solder M is fed to the first opening <b>24</b><i>g </i>at a predetermined rate, molten by the supply cylinder <b>24</b> and then supplied further at a flow rate that is controlled according to the quantity of molten solder to be satisfactorily filled into the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0283">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the supply cylinder <b>24</b> includes a flow path <b>24</b><i>i </i>through which molten solder M<b>1</b> produced by melting thread solder M as described above flows, a melting surface <b>24</b><i>m </i>for melting thread solder M at which the first opening <b>24</b><i>g </i>of the flow path <b>24</b><i>i </i>is formed and a discharge surface <b>24</b><i>n </i>that is the other surface of the supply cylinder <b>24</b> at which the discharge port <b>24</b><i>h </i>is formed and a heater <b>24</b><i>l </i>for melting thread solder M is wound around the outer peripheral surface thereof. The supply cylinder <b>24</b> having such a configuration can feed out thread solder M at a rate that is controlled so as make its lower end facet contact the melting surface <b>24</b><i>m </i>in an attitude of closing the first opening <b>24</b><i>g </i>and presses the thread solder M against the melting surface <b>24</b><i>m </i>to melt the thread solder M. Then, the molten solder M<b>1</b> flows through the flow path <b>24</b><i>i </i>and continuously discharged from the discharge port <b>24</b><i>h. </i></p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0284">The melting surface <b>24</b><i>m </i>where the first opening <b>24</b><i>g </i>is formed is the bottom surface of a recessed section produced by, for example, spot facing a corresponding part of the surface of the supply cylinder <b>24</b>. The diameter &#xf8;B of the first opening <b>24</b><i>g </i>is less than the diameter &#xf8;A of the end facet of the thread solder M that contacts the melting surface <b>24</b><i>m </i>and the flow path <b>24</b><i>i </i>is formed as a tubular path having a diameter &#xf8;B at least at and near the melting surface <b>24</b><i>m</i>. As a result, if oxides E are formed on the outer peripheral surface of the thread solder M, the oxides E trying to flow into the flow path <b>24</b><i>i </i>is blocked by the outer peripheral edge of the first opening <b>24</b><i>g</i>, or the melting surface <b>24</b><i>m</i>, and only clean molten solder M<b>1</b> that is substantially not mixed with oxides E flows into the flow path <b>24</b><i>i</i>. Since the thickness of the layer of oxides E produced on the surface of the thread solder M that is stored in the atmosphere is normally about tens of several &#x3bc;m, it is sufficient for the difference between the diameter of the thread solder M and the diameter of the first opening <b>24</b><i>g</i>, of &#xf8;A&#x2212;&#xf8;B, to be about 1 mm. Preferably, a peripheral wall <b>24</b><i>o </i>is formed around the outer periphery of the supply cylinder <b>24</b> so as to surround the melting surface <b>24</b><i>m</i>. The oxides E that are prevented from flowing into the flow path <b>24</b><i>i </i>are stored in the concaved bottom section of the melting surface <b>24</b><i>m</i>, which may well be made to flow out and collected appropriately by sucking or by cutting out a part of the peripheral wall <b>24</b><i>o</i>. A terminal section of the flow path <b>24</b><i>i </i>located close to the discharge surface <b>24</b><i>n </i>is preferably so formed as to be substantially orthogonal relative to the discharge surface <b>24</b><i>n</i>. Then, as a result, when the supply cylinder <b>24</b> is positioned so as to make the discharge surface <b>24</b><i>n </i>squarely face the outer peripheral end facets of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> with a gap s separating them, the flow path <b>24</b><i>i </i>is held in parallel with the outer peripheral gap k at and near the discharge surface <b>24</b><i>n. </i></p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0285">Now the operation of supplying molten solder M<b>1</b> of the above-described supply cylinder <b>24</b> will be described below. The supply apparatus is so arranged that, when molten solder M<b>1</b> is being supplied and flowing in a steady state in the supply cylinder <b>24</b>, the supply apparatus moves along the outer peripheral gap k of glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. The steady state refers to a state where molten solder M<b>1</b> can be injected into the gaps Gu and Gd respectively from the guide grooves <b>25</b><i>e </i>and <b>25</b><i>h </i>of the guide section <b>25</b> and the top of the molten solder M<b>1</b> that gets to the discharge port <b>24</b><i>h </i>is located at a level higher than the guide groove <b>25</b><i>e </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>. Preferably, the duration of time that is spent from the time when the supply of molten solder M<b>1</b> from the first opening <b>24</b><i>g </i>starts to the time when this steady state is reached is as short as possible. For this reason, the rate of supplying molten solder M<b>1</b> is controlled in such a way that the flow path <b>24</b><i>i </i>is quickly filled with molten solder M<b>1</b> when the supply of molten solder M<b>1</b> is started and the flow of molten solder M<b>1</b> is still in an unsteady state but molten solder M<b>1</b> can satisfactorily fill the outer peripheral gap k in a steady state.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0286">In a steady state, the lower flow path <b>24</b><i>q </i>of the flow path <b>24</b><i>i </i>that is vertically divided by the guide section <b>25</b> is filled with molten solder M<b>1</b> and the gap s between the lower discharge port <b>24</b><i>k </i>where the lower flow path <b>24</b><i>q </i>opens and the corresponding end facet of the glass substrate w<b>4</b> is also filled with molten solder M<b>1</b>. In this state, molten solder M<b>1</b> is injected into the second gap Gd and excessive molten solder M<b>1</b> overflows from the gap s between the discharge port <b>24</b><i>k </i>and the corresponding end facet of the glass substrate w<b>4</b>. Molten solder M<b>1</b> is supplied to the flow path <b>24</b><i>i </i>at a controlled flow rate and hence the molten solder M<b>1</b> existing in the gap s between the discharge port <b>24</b><i>k </i>and the glass substrate w<b>4</b> is subjected only to low supply pressure. However, since the gap s is open in the direction of gravity (downward), the leaking molten solder M<b>1</b> hangs down. Such a leak from the lower flow path <b>24</b><i>q </i>takes place in the time period from the start of the supply of molten solder M<b>1</b> to the time when the flow of molten solder M<b>1</b> reaches a steady state so that the leak is desirably as small as possible. On the other hand, if the gap s between the upper discharge port <b>24</b><i>j </i>and the corresponding end facet of the glass substrate w<b>3</b> that is connected to the upper flow path <b>24</b><i>p </i>is filled with molten solder M<b>1</b>, the molten solder M<b>1</b> existing in this gap hardly leaks out because of the existence of the guide section <b>25</b>. Therefore, to reduce the leak of molten solder M<b>1</b> from the gap s between the discharge port <b>24</b><i>h </i>and the end facets of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>, it is only necessary to reduce the quantity of molten solder M<b>1</b> that is discharged from the lower flow path <b>24</b><i>q. </i></p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0287">Since the guide section <b>25</b> is fitted to a downwardly offset position relative to the center of the discharge port <b>24</b><i>h</i>, the area of the lower discharge port <b>24</b><i>k </i>is made smaller than that of the upper discharge port <b>24</b><i>j </i>in the supply cylinder <b>24</b>. Additionally, the capacity of the lower flow path <b>24</b><i>q </i>is made smaller than that of the upper flow path <b>24</b><i>p</i>. Therefore, the quantity of molten solder M<b>1</b> that is discharged from the lower discharge port <b>24</b><i>k </i>is smaller than the quantity of molten solder M<b>1</b> that is discharged from the upper discharge port <b>24</b><i>j</i>. In other words, a relatively small quantity of molten solder M<b>1</b> is discharged from the lower flow path <b>24</b><i>q </i>of the supply cylinder <b>24</b> and hence the quantity of molten solder M<b>1</b> leaking out from the gaps between the discharge port <b>24</b><i>h </i>and the corresponding end facets of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> can be reduced and the time necessary for reaching a steady state can also be reduced. The quantity of offset F of the guide section <b>25</b> may be appropriately selected on the basis of the supply rate of molten solder M<b>1</b>, the size of the gap s between the discharge surface <b>24</b><i>n </i>and the corresponding end facets of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> and the dimensions of the guide grooves <b>25</b><i>e </i>and <b>25</b><i>h</i>. The quantity of molten solder M<b>1</b> with which the lower flow path <b>24</b><i>q </i>is filled is reduced when a large quantity is selected for the offset F so that then the quantity of the leaking out molten solder M<b>1</b> can be reduced and, at the same time, the time before reaching a steady state can also be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0288">When a supply cylinder <b>24</b> as described above is employed, the supplied clean molten solder M<b>1</b> is then supplied into the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>, while the clean molten solder M<b>1</b> is only slightly brought into contact with the external atmosphere at the gap s between the discharge surface <b>24</b><i>n </i>and the corresponding end facets of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> and also in the gaps Gu and Gd. Therefore, the supplied clean molten solder M<b>1</b> contacts the main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> in a state where oxidation thereof is suppressed in the atmosphere. Thus, the supply apparatus of this example is suitable for using SnAgAl based alloy solder that shows an excellent bonding performance with glass by way of oxygen existing to an appropriate extent. To improve the filling performance of molten solder M<b>1</b>, the area of the surface of the guide section <b>25</b> that contacts molten solder M<b>1</b> is preferably subjected to a process for raising its wettability relative to molten solder M<b>1</b>. For example, it is preferably coated with Ag, Cr, Al, Mo, W, V, Nb or Ta. Additionally, it is preferably subjected to a nitriding treatment, which is an anti-corrosion treatment, so that the surface of the guide section <b>25</b> may not be corroded by molten solder M<b>1</b> and impurities may not be mixed into the molten solder M<b>1</b>. The surface of the flow path <b>24</b><i>i </i>is also preferably subjected to those processes.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0289">Now, the operation of supplying molten solder M<b>1</b> to the outer peripheral gap k of the supply apparatus of this example will be described below. The glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> that are laid one above the other with a gap maintaining member Q having a predetermined size interposed between them are placed in position on a table that contains a heat emitting body and movable in the two axial directions of the X-axis and the Y-axis and the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are heated to about the melting temperature of molten solder M<b>1</b>. The guide section <b>25</b> of the supply cylinder <b>24</b> is inserted into a predetermined position in the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> located at or near one of the edges of each of them and the supply cylinder <b>24</b> is moved so as to produce a predetermined gap s between the corresponding end facets of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> and the discharge surface <b>24</b><i>n</i>. The position of the trowel section <b>25</b><i>d </i>is adjusted in advance so that the trowel section <b>25</b><i>d </i>comes to a position at the vertical center of the outer peripheral gap k or its vicinity at this time, although it is difficult to rigorously adjust the position so as to make it agree with the center of the outer peripheral gap k. However, if the position is not adjusted satisfactorily, some of the contact sections <b>25</b><i>b </i>can hit the end facet of the glass substrate w<b>3</b> or w<b>4</b> if the trowel section <b>25</b><i>d </i>is inserted into the outer peripheral gap k. The supply cylinder <b>24</b> is supported by a floating mechanism in terms of its vertical direction and the contact sections <b>25</b><i>b </i>are beveled so that the contact sections <b>25</b><i>b </i>can be fitted into the outer peripheral gap k with ease. Then, as a result, the trowel section <b>25</b><i>d </i>is placed substantially at the vertical center of the outer peripheral gap k and the gap Gu and the gap Gd between the trowel section <b>25</b><i>d </i>and the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> become vertically equal to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0290">Clean molten solder M<b>1</b> is supplied to the flow path <b>24</b><i>i </i>and starts to be discharged from the discharge port <b>24</b><i>h </i>at a predetermined flow rate. Since the guide section <b>25</b> is offset and fitted to the discharge port <b>24</b><i>h </i>in a downwardly displaced manner, a steady state is reached within a short period of time and the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> can be moved quickly in a direction (the X-direction) at a predetermined speed in order to supply molten solder M<b>1</b> to one of the sides of the outer peripheral gap k. Meanwhile, molten solder M<b>1</b> is injected into the gaps Gu and Gd and filled into the outer peripheral gap k but, if molten solder M<b>1</b> leaks from the gap s between the lower discharge port <b>24</b><i>k </i>of the guide section <b>25</b> and the glass substrate w<b>4</b>, the molten solder M<b>1</b> leaks only to a small extent and practically does not hang down and drop. Additionally, since the contact sections <b>25</b><i>b </i>are fitted into the outer peripheral gap k and held in a floating state, they follow the vertical positional fluctuations of the outer peripheral gap k that can arise when the glass substrate w<b>4</b> has a varying thickness and/or the table surface has vertical undulations in the X-direction and the sizes of the gaps Gu and Gd are maintained. Then, as a result, a substantially same quantity of molten solder M<b>1</b> is injected both along the top surface and along the bottom surface of the trowel section <b>25</b><i>d </i>so that the molten solder M<b>1</b> that moves as the trowel section <b>25</b><i>d </i>moves shows a same state both in the gap Gu and in the gap Gd and hence molten solder M<b>1</b> is supplied equally to the main surface of the glass substrate w<b>3</b> and to the main surface of the glass substrate w<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0291">Besides, as ultrasonic vibrations are employed and applied to the guide section <b>25</b> during a molten solder filling operation, both the wettability of the guide section <b>25</b> and that of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> relative to molten solder M<b>1</b> are improved so that molten solder M<b>1</b> is smoothly supplied if the gaps Gu and Gd are narrow. The ultrasonic vibrations also act on the main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> by way of molten solder M<b>1</b> to remove the air bubbles and the foreign objects such as oxide film existing at the contact interfaces of molten solder M<b>1</b> and the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. Then, the bonding performance of molten solder M<b>1</b> relative to the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> is improved to effectively improve the bonding strength of the glass panel W.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0292">As the operation of supplying molten solder M<b>1</b> to one of the sides of the outer peripheral gap k is completed in a manner as described above, the casing <b>24</b><i>e </i>equipped with the supply cylinder <b>24</b> is driven to turn by 90&#xb0; in the horizontal direction and then the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are driven to move horizontally in the direction of a side thereof that is orthogonal to the above-described side. Then, molten solder M<b>1</b> is supplied into the outer peripheral gap k at this side as in the case of the above-described side and molten solder M<b>1</b> hardly hangs down to the corresponding outer peripheral end facets of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. This operation is repeated sequentially at each of the sides and molten solder M<b>1</b> is supplied to all the sides of the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> without rising up and hanging down to at outer end facets of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. As the operation of supplying molten solder M<b>1</b> to the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> is completed, the table on which the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are placed is moved to the outside. The glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are then removed from the table that is moved to the outside but no molten solder M<b>1</b> is adhering to the table so that no operation is required to remove solder from the table.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0293">Subsequently, another table on which another pair of glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are placed and heated for preparation is brought in and another operation of supplying molten solder M<b>1</b> same as the above-described one is started to the outer peripheral gap k of the new glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. Note, however, that the vertical position of the outer peripheral gap k of the new glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> can be different from the position of the outer peripheral gap k of the former glass substrates due to the difference of thickness between the new and old glass substrates w<b>4</b> and/or the difference of state where glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are fitted to the table. If such is the case, the supply apparatus of this example can insert the trowel section <b>25</b><i>d </i>into the vertical center position of the outer peripheral gap k and fill it with molten solder M<b>1</b> in a state where the size of the gaps Gu and Gd is maintained because the supply cylinder <b>24</b> is vertically supported by a floating mechanism and the contact sections <b>25</b><i>b </i>are provided with bevels c.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0294">When the guide section <b>25</b> moves along the outer peripheral gap k, molten solder M<b>1</b> permeates between the contact sections <b>25</b><i>b </i>and the main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> due to the capillary phenomenon. After the contact sections <b>25</b><i>b </i>contact and pass the respective main surfaces, molten solder M<b>1</b> flows from the trowel section <b>25</b><i>d </i>and supplied to the contact regions of the contact sections <b>25</b><i>b </i>as it is drawn by the molten solder M<b>1</b> that permeates. Molten solder M<b>1</b> may not be supplied to all the contact regions of the contact sections <b>25</b><i>b </i>if the length L<b>1</b> of the contact sections <b>25</b><i>b </i>is large so that the length L<b>1</b> of the contact sections <b>25</b><i>b </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> is preferably small and suitably about 10 to 20% of the width of the bonding section n. The top and bottom surfaces of the contact sections <b>25</b><i>b </i>may not necessarily be planes as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> but may alternatively be planes where grooves are formed or curved surfaces.</p>

<p id="p-0300" num="0303">Firstly, the supply apparatus of this example will be described. The supply apparatus is adapted to manufacture a glass panel W by using glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> having different dimensions in plan views, the sides of the lower glass substrate w<b>4</b> projecting beyond the corresponding respective sides of the upper glass substrate w<b>3</b>, as described above by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51(</figref><i>d</i>). The supply apparatus includes a supply cylinder <b>27</b>, a holder <b>27</b><i>a </i>to which the supply cylinder <b>27</b> is fitted, a floating mechanism <b>27</b><i>b </i>for making the holder <b>27</b><i>a </i>float mainly up and down and a casing <b>27</b><i>e </i>for supporting the floating mechanism <b>27</b><i>b</i>. The floating mechanism <b>27</b><i>b </i>can be realized as a structure provided with upper and lower rubber pieces or springs showing an appropriate degree of resiliency so as to be able to allow the supply cylinder <b>27</b> to maintain its attitude without exerting excessive force to the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> or the supply cylinder <b>27</b>. Preferably, an ultrasonic vibrating body <b>27</b><i>c </i>fitted to the holder <b>27</b><i>a </i>is bonded to the supply cylinder <b>27</b> by way of a shaft member <b>27</b><i>d </i>so as to longitudinally apply ultrasonic vibrations to the supply cylinder <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0304">The supply cylinder <b>27</b> contains in the inside thereof a flow path <b>27</b><i>i </i>having a circular cross section, and has a guide section <b>28</b>. Molten solder M<b>1</b> flows through the flow path <b>27</b><i>i </i>that is open at one of the lateral surfaces, or the surface <b>27</b><i>k</i>, and at the end facet, or the surface <b>27</b><i>l</i>. The guide section <b>28</b> is fitted to the surface <b>27</b><i>l</i>. A front end section of the guide section <b>28</b> is inserted into the outer peripheral gap k of glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> to supply the molten solder M<b>1</b> that is discharged from the second opening <b>27</b><i>h </i>(to be referred to as discharge port in Examples No. 4-1, No. 4-2 and No. 4-3 hereinafter) at the surface <b>27</b><i>l </i>to the outer peripheral gap k through the guide section <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0305">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, when molten solder M<b>1</b> is supplied to the outer peripheral gap k of glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>, the supply cylinder <b>27</b> is placed at a position separated upwardly from the outer peripheral gap k by a predetermined height so that the supply cylinder <b>27</b> may not interfere with the projecting part of the lower glass substrate w<b>4</b> that projects relative to the upper glass substrate w<b>3</b>. Thus, the guide section <b>28</b> of this example shows a stepped profile whose step is determined according to the different of height, or the vertical distance, between the discharge port <b>27</b><i>h </i>of the supply cylinder <b>27</b> and the outer peripheral gap k.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0306">The supply apparatus inserts a front end section of the guide section <b>28</b> into the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> in a state where the surface <b>271</b> of the supply cylinder <b>27</b> is separated from the corresponding end facet of the upper glass substrate w<b>3</b> by a predetermined gap s and moves the supply cylinder <b>27</b> at a predetermined speed so as to make a full turn along the outer peripheral gap.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0307">The supply apparatus may not necessarily be solely responsible for carrying out the move and the table on which the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are placed may be made to participate in the operation of carrying out the move so as to relatively move the supply cylinder and the glass substrates. In other words, the structure of the supply apparatus is variable and can be defined according to the mode of moving the supply cylinder. Regardless of the structure of the supply apparatus that is defined according to the mode of moving the supply cylinder, the mechanism for moving glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> and the mechanism for moving the supply apparatus can be realized by means of known techniques, for example by combining a motor and a ball screw or a linear guide for linear movements and combining a motor or a cylinder and a bearing for revolving movements. The casing <b>27</b><i>e </i>may well be fitted to a moving mechanism by way of a jig or the like for adjusting its vertical position. With the above-described arrangement, the height of the guide section <b>25</b> can be adjusted relative to the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> by seeing the thickness of the glass substrate w<b>4</b> and the height of the gap maintaining member Q.</p>

The angle &#x3b8; is determined by the length L by which the slope section <b>28</b><i>f </i>horizontally projects and the height F of the step.

<p id="p-0307" num="0310">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, the plate-shaped body <b>28</b><i>c </i>of the guide section <b>28</b> is inserted into the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> from the front end sections <b>28</b><i>d </i>thereof to supply the molten solder M<b>1</b> discharged from the discharge port <b>27</b><i>h </i>of the supply cylinder <b>27</b> into the outer peripheral gap k. As the guide section <b>28</b> is driven to move along the outer peripheral gap k, the guide section <b>28</b> makes molten solder M<b>1</b> to slide on the main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> or, in other words, supplies molten solder M<b>1</b> into the outer peripheral gap k, while applying the molten solder to the main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. Therefore, the front end section <b>28</b><i>d </i>of the plate-shaped body <b>28</b><i>c </i>has a thickness T<b>2</b> smaller than the size g of the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. The range L<b>2</b> extending from the front end of the front end section <b>28</b><i>d </i>is referred to as trowel section <b>28</b><i>g </i>hereinafter. The top and bottom surfaces of the trowel section <b>28</b><i>g </i>are arranged so as to respectively face the main surface of the glass substrate w<b>3</b> and that of the glass substrate w<b>4</b> with predetermined gaps Gu and Gd interposed between them.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0311">As the guide section <b>28</b> is inserted into the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>, the projecting bodies <b>28</b><i>a </i>maintain the gaps Gu and Gd to respective constant values if the vertical position of the outer peripheral gap k fluctuates. While the projecting bodies <b>28</b><i>a </i>are respectively arranged at the front end sections <b>28</b><i>d</i>, they may alternatively be arranged at other positions for some other purpose as will be described hereinafter. The projecting bodies <b>28</b><i>a </i>arranged at the front end sections <b>28</b><i>d </i>are to be referred to as contact sections <b>28</b><i>b </i>hereinafter. The contact sections <b>28</b><i>b </i>project from the top surfaces and the bottom surfaces of the front end section <b>28</b><i>d </i>and the thickness T<b>1</b> thereof is substantially same as the size g of the outer peripheral gap k. They have respective contact surfaces that are to be inserted into the outer peripheral gap k and slidable on the main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. The projecting bodies <b>28</b><i>a </i>(contact sections <b>28</b><i>b</i>) may be bonded to the plate-shaped body <b>28</b><i>c </i>(front end section <b>28</b><i>d</i>) or formed on the plate-shaped body <b>28</b> by means of a lamination process. The material of the projecting bodies <b>28</b><i>a </i>may not necessarily be same as that of the plate-shaped body <b>28</b><i>c</i>, which is typically metal, glass or ceramic, but an appropriate material can be selected for them according to the required characteristics of the projecting bodies <b>28</b><i>a </i>such as slidability and abrasion resistance. The projecting bodies <b>28</b><i>a </i>may be formed integrally with the plate-shaped body <b>28</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0312">With the above-described guide section <b>28</b>, the trowel section <b>28</b><i>g </i>is vertically secured in position in the outer peripheral gap k as the guide section <b>28</b> is inserted into the outer peripheral gap k to have the contact sections <b>28</b><i>b </i>fitted into the outer peripheral gap k. In other words, the first gap Gu between the top surfaces of the trowel sections <b>28</b><i>g </i>and the glass substrate w<b>3</b> and the second gap Gd between the bottom surfaces of the trowel sections <b>28</b><i>g </i>and the glass substrate w<b>4</b> can be maintained to respective constant values. Preferably, the contact sections <b>28</b><i>b </i>are subjected to, for example, an Ni water-repellent plating process in order to improve their sliding performance relative to glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. Additionally, the contact sections <b>28</b><i>b </i>are preferably beveled to show bevels at the lateral edges thereof running in the direction of insertion so that they may be smoothly fitted into the outer peripheral gap k. The bevels can be formed by producing straight or round slopes at the related edges by cutting, grinding or etching.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0313">Molten solder M<b>1</b> is discharged from the discharge port <b>27</b><i>h </i>onto the top surface of the guide section <b>28</b>. In a preferable mode of carrying out the present invention in this example, guide grooves <b>28</b><i>h </i>are formed on the top surface of the guide section <b>28</b> in order to smoothly guide molten solder M<b>1</b> to the front end section <b>28</b><i>d</i>. The plurality of guide grooves <b>28</b><i>h </i>are formed continuously along the center axis of the part of the flow path <b>27</b><i>i </i>located close to the discharge port <b>27</b><i>h </i>in the direction of which molten solder M<b>1</b> is discharged and on the top surfaces of the base end sections <b>28</b><i>e</i>, the slope section <b>28</b><i>f </i>and the front end section <b>28</b><i>d</i>. Note that the guide groove forming mode of this example is not limited to the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36(</figref><i>a</i>) and alternatively a single guide groove <b>29</b><i>a </i>may be formed on the plate-shaped body <b>28</b><i>c </i>with a predetermined width and a predetermined depth. Like the guide section <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37(</figref><i>a</i>), the projecting bodies <b>28</b><i>a </i>extend to the slope section <b>28</b><i>f </i>and further to the base end section <b>28</b><i>e </i>and a guide groove <b>30</b><i>a </i>is formed by using the projecting bodies <b>28</b><i>a </i>as its lateral surfaces. A single guide groove or a plurality of guide grooves may be formed according to the flowability of molten solder M<b>1</b>, the size g of the outer peripheral gap k and other factors.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0314">Molten solder M<b>1</b> flows on the top surface of the guide section <b>28</b> and is supplied to the first gap Gu. The supply cylinder of this example is provided with a through hole <b>29</b><i>b </i>or a through hole <b>28</b><i>i </i>that is a cutout <b>28</b><i>j </i>formed respectively by cutting through or cutting out the front end section <b>28</b><i>d </i>in the direction of the thickness thereof in order to guide the molten solder M<b>1</b> that is supplied to the first gap Gu further to the second gap Gd as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37(</figref><i>a</i>). Alternatively, as in the case of the guide section <b>31</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37(</figref><i>b</i>), a cut out section <b>31</b><i>a </i>may be formed on the lateral surface of the front end section that faces the moving direction of the guide section <b>28</b> indicated by an arrow in which the guide section <b>28</b> is inserted and moved in the outer peripheral gap k so as to inject the molten solder M<b>1</b> that is injected into the first gap Gu further into the second gap Gd. The cut out section <b>31</b><i>a </i>is also a variety of the through hole section <b>28</b><i>i. </i></p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0315">By arranging such a through hole section <b>28</b><i>i</i>, as the guide section <b>28</b> inserted into the outer peripheral gap k is moved along the outer peripheral gap k, the molten solder M<b>1</b> injected into the first gap Gu is satisfactorily led to the second gap Gd. Then, as a result, molten solder M<b>1</b> flows so as to be supplied from the gaps Gu and Gd to a part of the outer peripheral gap k located behind the guide section <b>28</b> as viewed in the moving direction of the guide section <b>28</b> and applied to the main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> by the trowel section <b>28</b><i>g</i>. The width of the supplied molten metal M<b>1</b> is substantially determined by the length L<b>2</b> of the trowel section <b>28</b><i>g </i>so that it is stable. The thickness T<b>2</b> of the trowel section <b>28</b><i>g </i>may be selected on the basis of the size of the gap Gu and that of the gap Gd that are by turn selected so as to make molten solder M<b>1</b> contact the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> under uniform pressure when the molten solder M<b>1</b> is applied. The gaps Gu and Gd are preferably narrow for molten metal M<b>1</b> to follow and move with the trowel section <b>28</b><i>g </i>so as to be applied satisfactorily to the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. The surface of the trowel section <b>28</b><i>g </i>is provided with fine grooves that intersect the moving direction thereof in order to improve the follow-up performance of molten solder M<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0316">Now, the supply cylinder <b>27</b> will be described in detail. The supply cylinder <b>27</b> supplies molten solder M<b>1</b> from the first opening <b>27</b><i>g </i>formed at the one surface <b>27</b><i>k </i>and discharges molten solder M<b>1</b> from the discharge port <b>27</b><i>h </i>that is the second opening formed at the other surface <b>27</b><i>l</i>. The molten solder M<b>1</b> that is supplied to the first opening <b>27</b><i>g </i>is produced by, for example, feeding thread solder M to the first opening <b>27</b><i>g </i>at a predetermined rate and melting the thread solder M by the supply cylinder <b>27</b> so that molten solder M<b>1</b> may be supplied at a controlled rate at which the molten solder M<b>1</b> can satisfactorily fill the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0317">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, the supply cylinder <b>27</b> includes a flow path <b>27</b><i>i </i>through which molten solder M<b>1</b> produced by melting thread solder M flows, a melting surface <b>27</b><i>k </i>for melting thread solder M where a first opening <b>27</b><i>g </i>of the flow path <b>27</b><i>i </i>is formed and a discharge surface <b>27</b><i>l </i>where a discharge port <b>27</b><i>h </i>is formed and a heater <b>27</b><i>j </i>is wound around its outer peripheral surface to melt thread solder M. The supply cylinder <b>27</b> having the above-described arrangement can feed thread solder M at a controlled speed that is good for making the thread solder M contact the melting surface <b>27</b><i>k </i>in an attitude in which its lower end closes the first opening <b>27</b><i>g </i>and press the thread solder M against the melting surface <b>27</b><i>k </i>to melt it. Then, molten solder M<b>1</b> flows through the flow path <b>27</b><i>i </i>and is continuously discharged from the discharge port <b>27</b><i>h. </i></p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0318">The melting surface <b>27</b><i>k </i>where the first opening <b>27</b><i>g </i>is formed is the bottom surface of a recessed section produced by, for example, spot facing a corresponding part of the lateral surface of the supply cylinder <b>27</b>. The diameter &#xf8;B of the first opening <b>27</b><i>g </i>is less than the diameter &#xf8;A of the end facet of the thread solder M that contacts the melting surface <b>27</b><i>k </i>and the flow path <b>27</b><i>i </i>is formed as a tubular path having a diameter &#xf8;B at least at and near the melting surface <b>27</b><i>k</i>. As a result, if oxides E are formed on the outer peripheral surface of the thread solder M, the oxides E trying to flow into the flow path <b>27</b><i>i </i>is blocked by the outer peripheral edge of the first opening <b>27</b><i>g</i>, or the melting surface <b>27</b><i>k</i>, and only clean molten solder M<b>1</b> that is substantially not mixed with oxides E flows into the flow path <b>27</b><i>i</i>. Since the thickness of the layer of oxides E produced on the surface of the thread solder M that is stored in the atmosphere is normally about tens of several &#x3bc;m, it is sufficient for the difference between the diameter of the thread solder M and the diameter of the first opening <b>24</b><i>g</i>, of &#xf8;A&#x2212;&#xf8;B, to be about 1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0319">Preferably, a peripheral wall <b>27</b><i>m </i>is formed around the outer periphery of the supply cylinder <b>27</b> so as to surround the melting surface <b>27</b><i>k</i>. The oxides E that are prevented from flowing into the flow path <b>27</b><i>i </i>is stored in the concaved bottom section of the melting surface <b>27</b><i>k</i>, which may well be made to flow out and collected appropriately by sucking or by cutting out a part of the peripheral wall <b>27</b><i>m</i>. A terminal section of the flow path <b>27</b><i>i </i>located close to the discharge surface <b>27</b><i>l </i>is preferably so formed as to be substantially orthogonal relative to the discharge surface <b>27</b><i>l</i>. Then, as a result, when the supply cylinder <b>27</b> is positioned so as to make the discharge surface <b>27</b><i>l </i>squarely face the outer peripheral end facet of the glass substrate w<b>3</b> with a gap s separating them, the flow path <b>24</b><i>i </i>is held in parallel with the outer peripheral gap k at and near the discharge surface <b>24</b><i>n. </i></p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0320">Note that in the case of the supply cylinder <b>27</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36(</figref><i>a</i>), a cut out groove is formed at a lower part of the discharge surface <b>27</b> and the guide section <b>28</b> is incorporated into the supply cylinder <b>27</b> as the base end section <b>28</b><i>e </i>thereof is inserted into the cut out groove so as to expose the base end section <b>28</b><i>e </i>to the flow path <b>27</b><i>i</i>. However, it is not necessary that the top surface of the guide section <b>28</b> is exposed to the flow path <b>27</b><i>i </i>so long as the molten solder M<b>1</b> discharged from the discharge port <b>27</b><i>h </i>flows only on the top surface. As in the case of the supply cylinder <b>32</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39(</figref><i>a</i>), a lower part of the supply cylinder <b>27</b> including the flow path <b>27</b><i>i </i>may be cut out to produce a cut out section for a predetermined axial length from the discharge surface <b>27</b><i>l </i>and the top surface of the base end section <b>28</b><i>e </i>may be brought into tight contact with and bonded to the top surface of the cut out section so as to close the cut out section. A seal plate <b>32</b><i>a </i>may be arranged when a gap is produced at the bonding section of the cut out section and the base end section <b>28</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0321">Alternatively, as in the case of the supply cylinder <b>32</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39(</figref><i>b</i>), a fitting surface to which the flow path <b>27</b><i>i </i>is not exposed may be axially formed at a lower part of the supply cylinder <b>27</b> and the top surface of the base end section <b>28</b><i>e </i>may be brought into tight contact with and bonded to the fitting surface. Still alternatively, in the supply cylinder <b>27</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36(</figref><i>a</i>), an insertion hole may be cut in the cylinder part of the supply cylinder <b>27</b> from the discharge surface <b>27</b><i>l </i>in such a way that the flow path <b>27</b><i>i </i>is not exposed to it and the guide section <b>28</b> may be incorporated into the supply cylinder <b>27</b> by inserting the guide section <b>28</b> into the insertion hole.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0322">While the front end section <b>28</b><i>d </i>and the base end section <b>28</b><i>e </i>of the guide section <b>28</b> are arranged in parallel with each other in the case of the supply cylinder <b>27</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36(</figref><i>a</i>), the front end section <b>28</b><i>d </i>and the base end section <b>28</b><i>e </i>may alternatively be so arranged as to intersect each other with a predetermined angle.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0323">The operation of supplying molten solder M<b>1</b> of the above-described supply cylinder <b>24</b> will be described below. The supply apparatus is so arranged that, when molten solder M<b>1</b> is being supplied and flowing in a steady state in the supply cylinder <b>27</b>, the supply apparatus moves along the outer peripheral gap k of glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. The steady state refers to a state where molten solder M<b>1</b> can be discharged from the discharge port <b>27</b><i>h </i>onto the top surface of the guide section <b>28</b> and injected into the outer peripheral gap k and also a state where the discharge port <b>27</b><i>h </i>is substantially filled with molten solder M<b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>. Preferably, the duration of time that is spent from the time when the supply of molten solder M<b>1</b> from the first opening <b>27</b><i>g </i>starts to the time when this steady state is reached is as short as possible. For this reason, the rate of supplying molten solder M<b>1</b> is controlled in such a way that the flow path <b>27</b><i>i </i>is quickly filled with molten solder M<b>1</b> when the supply of molten solder M<b>1</b> is started and the flow of molten solder M<b>1</b> is still in an unsteady state but molten solder M<b>1</b> can satisfactorily fill the outer peripheral gap k in a steady state.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0324">In a steady state, the molten solder M<b>1</b> discharged from the discharge port <b>27</b><i>h </i>is supplied into the outer peripheral gap k only from the top surface of the guide section <b>28</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>. Therefore, the molten solder M<b>1</b> is injected firstly into the first gap Gu and then into the second gap Gd by way of the first gap Gu. At this time, the molten solder M<b>1</b> is injected into the first gap Gu, filling the gap s between the top surface of the slope section <b>28</b><i>f </i>and the glass substrate w<b>3</b>. Thus, the molten solder M<b>1</b> flows down the slope section <b>28</b><i>f </i>and, since a guide groove <b>28</b><i>h </i>is formed in the guide section <b>28</b> along the direction of the flowing down molten solder M<b>1</b>, the molten solder M<b>1</b> is inject into the first gap Gu very smoothly. Meanwhile, the molten solder M<b>1</b> existing in the gap s between the top surface of the slope section <b>28</b><i>f </i>and the glass substrate w<b>3</b> scarcely leaks from the slope section <b>28</b><i>f </i>because the front end section <b>28</b><i>d </i>is there. Therefore, it is possible to form a bonding section n without any molten solder M<b>1</b> leaking out to the projecting part of the lower glass substrate w<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0325">Thus, when the supply cylinder <b>27</b> as described above is used, the supplied clean molten solder M<b>1</b> is only slightly brought into contact with the external atmosphere at the gaps between the discharge surface <b>27</b><i>l </i>and the corresponding end facet of the glass substrate w<b>3</b> and also at the gaps Gu and Gd before the clean molten solder M<b>1</b> is filled into the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. Therefore, the supplied clean molten solder M<b>1</b> contacts the main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> in a state where oxidation thereof is suppressed even in the atmosphere. Thus, the supply apparatus of this example is suitable for using SnAgAl based alloy solder that shows an excellent bonding performance with glass by way of oxygen existing to an appropriate extent. To improve the filling performance of molten solder M<b>1</b>, the area of the surface of the guide section <b>27</b> that contacts molten solder M<b>1</b> is preferably subjected to a process for raising its wettability relative to molten solder M<b>1</b>. For example, it is preferably coated with Ag, Cr, Al, Mo, W, V, Nb or Ta. Additionally, it is preferably subjected to a nitriding treatment, which is an anti-corrosion treatment, so that the surface of the guide section <b>27</b> may not be corroded by molten solder M<b>1</b> and impurities may not be mixed into the molten solder M<b>1</b>. The surface of the flow path <b>27</b><i>i </i>is also preferably subjected to those processes.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0326">Now, the operation of supplying molten solder M<b>1</b> to the outer peripheral gap k of the supply apparatus of this example will be described below. The glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> that are laid one above the other with a gap maintaining member Q having a predetermined size interposed between them are placed in position on a table that contains a heat emitting body and movable in the two axial directions of the X-axis and the Y-axis and the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are heated to about the melting temperature of molten solder M<b>1</b>. The trowel section <b>28</b><i>g </i>of the guide section <b>28</b> of the supply cylinder <b>27</b> is inserted into a predetermined position in the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> located at or near one of the edges of each of them and the supply cylinder <b>27</b> is moved so as to produce a predetermined gap s between the end facet of the glass substrate w<b>3</b> and the discharge surface <b>27</b><i>l</i>. The position of the trowel section <b>28</b><i>g </i>is adjusted in advance so that the trowel section <b>28</b><i>g </i>comes to a position at the vertical center of the outer peripheral gap k or its vicinity at this time, although it is difficult to rigorously adjust the position so as to make it agree with the vertical center of the outer peripheral gap k. However, if the position is not adjusted satisfactorily, some of the contact sections <b>28</b><i>b </i>can hit the end facet of the glass substrate w<b>3</b> or w<b>4</b> if the trowel section <b>28</b><i>g </i>is successfully inserted into the outer peripheral gap k. The supply cylinder <b>27</b> is supported by a floating mechanism in terms of its vertical position and the contact sections <b>28</b><i>b </i>are beveled so that the contact sections <b>28</b><i>b </i>can be inserted into the outer peripheral gap k with ease. Then, as a result, the trowel section <b>28</b><i>g </i>is placed substantially at the vertical center of the outer peripheral gap k and the upper gap Gu and the lower gap Gd between the trowel section <b>28</b><i>g </i>and the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> become equal to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0327">Since molten solder M<b>1</b> is supplied to the flow path <b>27</b><i>i </i>at a controlled and predetermined flow rate, a steady state is reached within a short period of time and the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> can be moved quickly in a direction (the X-direction) at a predetermined speed in order to supply molten solder M<b>1</b> to one of the sides of the outer peripheral gap k. Meanwhile, molten solder M<b>1</b> is injected into the gaps Gu and Gd and supplied into the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> but, since no molten solder M<b>1</b> is supplied from the bottom surface of the guide section <b>28</b>, no molten solder M<b>1</b> leaks to the projecting part of the lower glass substrate w<b>4</b>. Additionally, since the contact sections <b>28</b><i>b </i>are fitted into the outer peripheral gap k and held in a floating state, they follow the vertical positional fluctuations of the outer peripheral gap k that can arise when the glass substrate w<b>4</b> has a varying thickness and/or the table surface has vertical undulations in the X-direction and the sizes of the gaps Gu and Gd are maintained. Then, as a result, a substantially same quantity of molten solder M<b>1</b> is injected both along the top, surface and along the bottom surface of the trowel section <b>28</b><i>g </i>so that the molten solder M<b>1</b> that moves as the trowel section <b>28</b><i>g </i>moves shows a same state both in the gap Gu and in the gap Gd and hence molten solder M<b>1</b> is supplied equally to the main surface of the glass substrate w<b>3</b> and to the main surface of the glass substrate w<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0328">Besides, as ultrasonic vibrations are employed and applied to the guide section <b>28</b> during a molten solder filling operation, both the wettability of the guide section <b>28</b> and that of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> relative to molten solder M<b>1</b> are improved so that molten solder M<b>1</b> is smoothly supplied if the gaps Gu and Gd are narrow. The ultrasonic vibrations also act on the main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> by way of molten solder M<b>1</b> to remove the air bubbles and the foreign objects such as oxide film existing at the contact interfaces of molten solder M<b>1</b> and the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. Then, the bonding performance of molten solder M<b>1</b> relative to the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> is improved to effectively improve the bonding strength of the glass panel W.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0329">As the operation of supplying molten solder M<b>1</b> to one of the sides of the outer peripheral gap k is completed in a manner as described above, the casing <b>27</b><i>e </i>equipped with the supply cylinder <b>27</b> is driven to turn by 90&#xb0; in the horizontal direction and then the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are driven to move horizontally in the direction of a side thereof that is orthogonal to the above-described side. Then, molten solder M<b>1</b> is supplied into the outer peripheral gap k at this side as in the case of the above-described side but molten solder M<b>1</b> scarcely leaks onto the projecting part of the glass substrate w<b>4</b>. This operation is repeated sequentially at each of the sides and molten solder M<b>1</b> is supplied to all the sides of the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> without leaking to the projecting part of the glass substrate w<b>4</b>. As the operation of supplying molten solder M<b>1</b> to the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> is completed, the table on which the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are placed is moved to the outside. The glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are then removed from the table that is moved to the outside but no molten solder M<b>1</b> is adhering to the table so that no operation is required to remove solder from the table.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0330">Subsequently, another table on which another pair of glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are placed and heated for preparation is brought in and another operation of supplying molten solder M<b>1</b> same as the above-described operation is started to the outer peripheral gap k of the new glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. Note, however, that the vertical position of the outer peripheral gap k of the new glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> can be different from the position of the outer peripheral gap k of the former glass substrates due to the difference of thickness between the new and old glass substrates w<b>4</b> and/or the difference of state where glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are fitted to the table. If such is the case, the supply apparatus of this example can insert the trowel section <b>28</b><i>g </i>into the vertical center position of the outer peripheral gap k and fill the outer peripheral gap k with molten solder M<b>1</b> in a state where the size of the gaps Gu and Gd is maintained because the supply cylinder <b>28</b> is vertically supported by a floating mechanism and the contact sections <b>28</b><i>b </i>are provided with bevels.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0331">When the guide section <b>28</b> moves along the outer peripheral gap k, molten solder M<b>1</b> permeates between the contact sections <b>28</b><i>b </i>and the main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> due to the capillary phenomenon. After the contact sections <b>28</b><i>b </i>contact and pass the respective main surfaces, molten solder M<b>1</b> flows from the trowel section <b>28</b><i>g </i>and supplied to the contact regions of the contact sections <b>28</b><i>b </i>as it is drawn by the molten solder M<b>1</b> that permeates.

<p id="p-0333" num="0336">A supply cylinder in which the contact sections for maintaining the gaps between the trowel section and the main surfaces of glass substrates are arranged at the rear end side of the plate-shaped body is described in each of the above Examples No. 4-1, No. 4-2 and No. 4-3.

<p id="p-0337" num="0340">A molten metal supply cylinder and a molten metal supply apparatus incorporating such a supply cylinder will be described below as Example No. 5 by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43 to 49</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0341">Firstly, the supply apparatus of this example will be described. The supply apparatus is adapted to manufacture a glass panel W as described above by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 51(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>51</b>(<i>b</i>). The supply apparatus includes a supply cylinder <b>38</b>, a holder <b>38</b><i>a </i>to which the supply cylinder <b>38</b> is fitted, a floating mechanism <b>38</b><i>b </i>for making the holder <b>38</b><i>a </i>float mainly up and down and a casing <b>38</b><i>e </i>for supporting the floating mechanism <b>38</b><i>b</i>. The floating mechanism <b>38</b><i>b </i>can be realized as a structure provided with upper and lower rubber pieces or springs showing an appropriate degree of resiliency so as to be able to allow the supply cylinder <b>38</b> to maintain its attitude without exerting excessive force to the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> or the supply cylinder <b>38</b>. Preferably, an ultrasonic vibration body <b>38</b><i>c </i>fitted to the holder <b>38</b><i>a </i>is connected to the supply cylinder <b>38</b> by way of a shaft member <b>38</b><i>d </i>so as to longitudinally apply ultrasonic vibrations to the supply cylinder <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0342">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43 and 44</figref>, the supply cylinder <b>38</b> contains in the inside thereof a flow path <b>38</b><i>i </i>showing a circular cross section for allowing molten solder M<b>1</b> to flow through the flow path <b>38</b><i>i </i>that is open at one of the surfaces, or the surface <b>38</b><i>k</i>, and at the other surface, or the surface <b>38</b><i>l</i>, thereof and has a guide section <b>39</b> fitted thereto. The guide section <b>39</b> is inserted into the flow path <b>38</b><i>i </i>by a depth of LO so as to extend orthogonally relative to the other surface <b>38</b><i>l</i>, crossing second opening (to be referred to as discharge port for Example 5 hereinafter) <b>38</b><i>h</i>. Thus, the supply cylinder <b>38</b> supplies the molten solder M<b>1</b> supplied from the opening at the surface <b>38</b><i>k </i>(to be referred to as first opening for Example 5 hereinafter) and discharged from the second opening <b>38</b><i>h </i>into the outer peripheral gap k by way of the guide section <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0343">The supply apparatus inserts the guide section <b>39</b> of the supply cylinder <b>38</b> into the outer peripheral gap k of glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> so as to produce a state where the other surface <b>38</b><i>l </i>is separated from the corresponding peripheral end facets of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> by a predetermined gap s and moves the supply cylinder <b>38</b> at a predetermined speed so as to make a full turn along the outer peripheral gap k. The supply apparatus may not necessarily be solely responsible for carrying out the move and the table on which the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are placed may be made to participate in the operation of carrying out the move so as to relatively move the supply cylinder and the glass substrates. In other words, the structure of the supply apparatus is variable and can be defined according to the mode of moving the supply cylinder. Regardless of the structure of the supply apparatus that is defined according to the mode of moving the supply cylinder, the mechanism for moving glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> and the mechanism for moving the supply apparatus can be realized by means of known techniques, for example by combining a motor and a ball screw or a linear guide for linear movements and combining a motor or a cylinder and a bearing for revolving movements. The casing <b>24</b><i>e </i>may well be fitted to a moving mechanism by way of a jig or the like for adjusting its vertical position. With the above-described arrangement, the height of the guide section <b>25</b> can be adjusted relative to the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> by seeing the thickness of the glass substrate w<b>4</b> and the height of the gap maintaining member Q.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0344">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, the guide section <b>39</b> includes a plate-shaped body <b>39</b><i>c </i>having a thickness (T<b>2</b>) smaller than the size g of the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> and projecting bodies <b>39</b><i>a </i>projecting from the top surface and the bottom surface of the plate-shaped body <b>39</b><i>c </i>and having a thickness (T<b>1</b>) substantially equal to the size of the outer peripheral gap. Note that the projecting bodies <b>39</b><i>a </i>of this example are arranged at left and right at the rear end side of the plate-shaped body <b>39</b><i>c </i>and the guide section <b>39</b> is fitted to the supply cylinder <b>38</b> in a state of being inserted into the supply cylinder <b>38</b> so as to horizontally cross the discharge port <b>38</b><i>h </i>substantially at the center thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0345">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>, the guide section <b>39</b> is inserted into the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> and supplies the molten solder M<b>1</b> discharged from the discharge port <b>38</b><i>h </i>of the supply cylinder <b>38</b> to the outer peripheral gap k. As the guide section <b>39</b> is driven to move along the outer peripheral gap k, the guide section <b>39</b> makes molten solder M<b>1</b> to slide on the main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> or, in other words, supplies molten solder M<b>1</b> into the outer peripheral gap k, while applying the molten solder M<b>1</b> to the main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. The part L<b>2</b> of the plate-shaped body <b>39</b><i>c </i>to be inserted into outer peripheral gap k as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref> is referred to as trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>hereinafter. The projecting bodies <b>39</b><i>a </i>formed on the top surface and the bottom surface of the plate-shaped body <b>39</b><i>c </i>are so formed as to project from the discharge port <b>38</b><i>h </i>by a length of L<b>1</b>. The projecting bodies <b>39</b><i>a </i>has respective contact surfaces that can be slide on the main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> when they are inserted into the outer peripheral gap k. The parts of the projecting bodies <b>39</b><i>a </i>where the contact surfaces are formed are referred to as contact sections <b>39</b><i>b </i>hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0346">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>, the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>injects the molten solder M<b>1</b> supplied from the discharge port <b>38</b><i>h </i>into the first gap Gu between the top surface of the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>and the glass substrate w<b>3</b> and the second gap gd between the bottom surface of the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>and the glass substrate w<b>4</b> and applies the molten solder M<b>1</b> to the main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. Therefore, for molten solder M<b>1</b> to be applied well to the main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>, the gaps Gu and Gd are preferably narrow so that the molten solder M<b>1</b> follows the move of the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d</i>. However, when the gaps Gu and Gd are narrow, it is difficult for the injected molten solder M<b>1</b> to get to the front end of the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>because of fluid resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0347">Now, how the molten solder M<b>1</b> injected into the gaps Gu and Gd flows will be discussed below by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47(</figref><i>a</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47(</figref><i>a</i>) shows a trowel section <b>40</b><i>c </i>formed at a front end part of a plate-shaped body showing a rectangular plan view. It is assumed that the trowel section <b>40</b><i>c </i>moves in the direction of arrow F.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0348">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47(</figref><i>a</i>), the molten solder M<b>1</b> supplied from the supply cylinder <b>38</b> flows in the gaps Gu and Gd toward the front end <b>40</b><i>g </i>of the trowel section <b>40</b><i>c</i>. Since the flowing speed of the molten solder M<b>1</b> is forced to fall as it moves toward the front end <b>40</b><i>g </i>by fluid resistance and the trowel section <b>40</b><i>c </i>is moving in the direction of arrow F, the moving direction of the molten solder M<b>1</b> flowing in the gaps Gu and Gd is shifted backward relative to the moving direction F as it advances toward the front end of the trowel section <b>40</b><i>c</i>. The flow line of the molten solder M<b>1</b> flowing in the gaps Gu and Gd can vary as a function of the supply rate of molten solder M<b>1</b>, the flow speed of molten solder M<b>1</b> at the entrances of the gaps Gu and Gd, the friction coefficient of the glass substrates and the trowel section, the wettability of the glass substrates and the trowel section relative to molten solder M<b>1</b>, the moving speed of the trowel section <b>40</b><i>c </i>and other molten solder supply conditions. All in all, the outer periphery r of the molten solder M<b>1</b> flowing through the gaps Gu and Gd does not get to the front end <b>40</b><i>g </i>of the trowel section <b>40</b><i>c </i>when the gaps Gu and Gd are made narrow.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0349">The molten solder M<b>1</b> that flows through the gap Gu and the molten solder M<b>1</b> that flows through the gap Gd meet each other to be filled into the outer peripheral gap after leaving the rear surface <b>40</b><i>i </i>of the trowel section <b>40</b><i>c</i>. The width of the bonding section n that is ultimately produced is determined by the width to which the molten solder M<b>1</b> is filled into the outer peripheral gap and applied to the main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> after leaving the rear surface <b>40</b><i>i </i>of the trowel section <b>40</b><i>c</i>. The application width is determined by the position of the outer periphery r of the molten solder M<b>1</b> at the rear surface <b>40</b><i>i</i>. As long as the outer periphery r of the molten solder M<b>1</b> does not get to the front end <b>40</b><i>g </i>of the trowel section <b>40</b><i>c </i>after flowing through the gaps Gu and Gd, molten solder M<b>1</b> flows through the gaps Gu and Gd in a state where the flow of molten solder M<b>1</b> is not subjected to any restriction and hence it is not stabilized. Therefore, when some or all of the molten solder supply conditions as described above are changed, the state of the flowing molten solder M<b>1</b> also changes. More specifically, the molten solder that flows through the first gap Gu and the molten solder that flows through the second gap Gd leave the rear surface <b>40</b><i>i </i>at positions that are differentiated from each other by the different outer peripheries r to consequently produce an uneven application width. Additionally, at the front end side of the trowel section <b>40</b><i>c</i>, voids and other defects arise at the contact interfaces of the molten solder M<b>1</b> and the glass substrates because the quantity of molten solder M<b>1</b> that moves to follow the move of the trowel section <b>40</b><i>c </i>is small. Such defects degrade the bonding strength and the sealing performance of the bonding section relative to the glass substrates. The application width can be stabilized by increasing the pressure under which molten solder M<b>1</b> is supplied to raise the rate of supplying molten solder M<b>1</b> and make the molten solder M<b>1</b> get to the front end of the trowel section <b>40</b><i>c </i>because the flow of molten solder M<b>1</b> is restricted by the front end <b>40</b><i>g</i>. However, in such a case, molten solder M<b>1</b> leaks from the gap s between the supply cylinder <b>38</b> and the corresponding end facets of the glass substrates to give rise to a problem of degrading the appearance and the quality of the produced glass panel.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0350">The guide section <b>39</b> of Example No. 5 dissolves the above problem. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>of the guide section <b>39</b> has a cut out section <b>39</b><i>m </i>at the lateral side facing the moving direction F and at the front end as viewed in the projecting direction of the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d</i>. More specifically, the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>has such a profile that the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>includes a front surface <b>39</b><i>f </i>that is orthogonal relative to the moving direction F, a front end facet <b>39</b><i>g </i>that is disposed at the front end of the projecting direction of the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>so as to run in parallel with the moving direction F, an oblique facet <b>39</b><i>h </i>that runs obliquely and backwardly from the front surface <b>39</b><i>f </i>as viewed in the moving direction F of the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>and produced by beveling the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>at the corner where the front surface <b>39</b><i>f </i>and the front end facet <b>39</b><i>g </i>meet, and a rear surface <b>39</b><i>i</i>. The area defined by a prolonged line of the front surface <b>39</b><i>f</i>, a prolonged line of the front end facet <b>39</b><i>g </i>and the oblique facet <b>39</b><i>h </i>is the cut out section <b>39</b><i>m. </i></p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0351">The trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>having such a cut out section <b>39</b><i>m </i>provides the following advantageous effect. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47(</figref><i>b</i>), of the molten solder M<b>1</b> that flows in the first gap Gu, molten solder M<b>1</b> existing at a front end part as viewed in the moving direction F gets to the oblique facet <b>39</b><i>h </i>and flows along the oblique facet <b>39</b><i>h </i>so as to be guided to the front end facet <b>39</b><i>h</i>. A part of the molten solder M<b>1</b> that gets to the oblique facet <b>39</b><i>h </i>crosses the oblique facet <b>39</b><i>h </i>and goes into the cut out section <b>39</b><i>m </i>so as to subsequently meet the molten solder M<b>1</b> flowing in the second gap Gd and flow along the oblique facet <b>39</b><i>h </i>to be guided to the front end facet <b>39</b><i>g</i>. As a result, the position of the outer periphery r of the molten solder M<b>1</b> that runs in the gaps Gu and Gd is restricted by the front end facet <b>39</b><i>g </i>and becomes invariable to consequently stabilize the width of the combined molten solder M<b>1</b> after leaving the rear surface <b>39</b><i>i</i>. Additionally, because the flow rate of molten solder M<b>1</b> increases at the front end section of the trowel section <b>36</b><i>d</i>, voids and other defects hardly occur at the contact interfaces of the molten solder M<b>1</b> and the glass substrates to make it possible to obtain a bonding section of a desired bonding quality. As described above, the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>of this example can supply molten solder M<b>1</b> with a desired width by making the outer periphery r of the flowing molten solder M<b>1</b> intersect the oblique facet <b>39</b><i>h </i>of the cut out section <b>39</b><i>m </i>after flowing through the gaps Gu and Gd and guiding it to the front end facet <b>39</b><i>g </i>without excessively supplying molten solder M<b>1</b> to fill the outer peripheral gap of the glass substrates.</p>

The length of the trowel section <b>44</b><i>d </i>along the moving direction F of the trowel section <b>44</b><i>d </i>can be made to be substantially constant from the base end to the front end facet <b>39</b><i>g </i>so as to make the effect of applying molten solder M<b>1</b> to the main surfaces of the glass substrates uniform in the direction (transversal direction) orthogonal relative to the moving direction F.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0356">Now, the contact sections <b>39</b><i>b </i>will be described below. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45 and 46</figref>, the vertical position of the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>in the outer peripheral gap k is determined as the guide section <b>39</b> is inserted into the outer peripheral gap k so as to make the contact sections <b>39</b><i>b </i>to be fitted to the outer peripheral gap k. More specifically, the first gap Gu between the top surface of the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>and the glass substrate w<b>3</b> and the second gap Gd between the bottom surface of the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>and the glass substrate w<b>4</b> can be held to respective constant values. Preferably, the contact sections <b>39</b><i>b </i>are subjected to a surface treatment, for example, an Ni water-repellent plating process in order to improve their sliding performance relative to the main surfaces of glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. Note that the plate-shaped body <b>39</b><i>c </i>that operates as trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>and the projecting bodies <b>39</b><i>a </i>that operate as contact sections <b>39</b><i>b </i>may be formed as an integral structure or they may be separately formed and bonded or otherwise assembled together by securing them to each other by way of a bonding or laminating process. In the case of an assembled structure, appropriate materials can be selected and combined to meet the functional requirements of the plate-shaped body <b>39</b><i>c </i>and the projecting bodies <b>39</b><i>a</i>. For example, glass may be selected for the plate-shaped body <b>39</b><i>c </i>and metal may be selected for the projecting bodies <b>39</b><i>a</i>. Additionally, the contact sections <b>39</b><i>b </i>are preferably beveled to show bevels c at the lateral edges of the surfaces thereof that form steps relative to the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>so that they may be smoothly put into the outer peripheral gap k. The bevels c can be formed by producing straight or round slopes at the related edges by cutting, grinding or etching.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0357">Now, the guide grooves formed in the guide section will be described below. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45(</figref><i>a</i>), guide grooves <b>39</b><i>e </i>are formed respectively on the top surface and the bottom surface of the guide section <b>39</b> at the base end thereof and the left and right projecting bodies <b>39</b><i>a </i>provide the lateral surfaces of the guide grooves <b>39</b><i>e</i>. Since the guide grooves <b>39</b><i>e </i>communicate with the flow path <b>38</b><i>i </i>by way of the discharge port <b>38</b><i>h</i>, the molten solder M<b>1</b> that flows through the flow path <b>38</b><i>i </i>and is discharged from the discharge port <b>38</b><i>h </i>then flows into the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>by way of the guide grooves <b>39</b><i>e</i>. The widths, the depths and the profiles of the guide grooves <b>39</b><i>e </i>may be determined appropriately according to the fluidity of molten solder M<b>1</b>. For example, guide grooves may be formed by cutting the top surface and the bottom surface of the plate-shaped body <b>39</b><i>c </i>down to the oblique facet <b>39</b><i>h </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45(</figref><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0358">The supply cylinder <b>38</b> supplies molten solder M<b>1</b> from the first opening <b>38</b><i>g </i>formed on one of the surfaces, or the surface <b>38</b><i>k</i>, and discharges the molten solder M<b>1</b> from the discharge port <b>38</b><i>h </i>formed on the other surface, or the surface <b>38</b><i>l</i>. Molten solder M<b>1</b> is supplied to the first opening <b>38</b><i>g </i>by, for example, supplying thread solder M to the first opening <b>38</b><i>g </i>at a predetermined rate and melting the thread solder M in the supply cylinder <b>38</b>. In this way, molten solder M<b>1</b> is supplied at a controlled flow rate that is determined according to the quantity of molten solder M<b>1</b> to be filled into the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0359">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, the supply cylinder <b>24</b> includes a flow path <b>38</b><i>i </i>through which Molten solder M<b>1</b> produced by melting thread solder M as described above flows, a melting surface <b>38</b><i>k </i>at which the first opening <b>38</b><i>g </i>of the flow path <b>38</b><i>i </i>is formed and which melts thread solder M and a discharge surface <b>38</b><i>l </i>at which the discharge port <b>38</b><i>h </i>is formed and a heater <b>38</b><i>j </i>for melting thread solder M is wound around the outer peripheral surface thereof. The supply cylinder <b>38</b> having such a configuration can feed out thread solder M at a rate that is controlled so as make its lower end facet contact the melting surface <b>38</b><i>k </i>in an attitude of closing the first opening <b>38</b><i>g </i>and presses the thread solder M against the melting surface <b>38</b><i>k </i>to melt it. Then, the molten solder M<b>1</b> flows through the flow path <b>38</b><i>i </i>and is continuously discharged from the discharge port <b>38</b><i>h. </i></p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0360">The melting surface <b>38</b><i>k </i>where the first opening <b>38</b><i>g </i>is formed is the bottom surface of a recessed section produced by, for example, spot facing a corresponding part of the surface of the supply cylinder <b>38</b>. The diameter &#xf8;B of the first opening <b>38</b><i>g </i>is less than the diameter &#xf8;A of the end facet of the thread solder M that contacts the melting surface <b>38</b><i>k </i>and the flow path <b>38</b><i>i </i>is formed as a tubular path having a diameter &#xf8;B at least at and near the melting surface <b>38</b><i>k</i>. As a result, if oxides E are formed on the outer peripheral surface of the thread solder M, the oxides E trying to flow into the flow path <b>38</b><i>i </i>is blocked by the outer peripheral edge of the first opening <b>38</b><i>g</i>, or the melting surface <b>38</b><i>k</i>, and only clean molten solder M<b>1</b> that is substantially not mixed with oxides E flows into the flow path <b>38</b><i>i</i>. Since the thickness of the layer of oxides E produced on the surface of the thread solder M that is stored in the atmosphere is normally about tens of several &#x3bc;m, it is sufficient for the difference between the diameter of the thread solder M and the diameter of the first opening <b>38</b><i>g</i>, of &#xf8;A&#x2212;&#xf8;B, to be about 1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0361">Preferably, a peripheral wall <b>38</b><i>m </i>is formed around the outer periphery of the supply cylinder <b>38</b> so as to surround the melting surface <b>38</b><i>k</i>. The oxides E that are prevented from flowing into the flow path <b>38</b><i>i </i>are stored in the concaved bottom section of the melting surface <b>38</b><i>k</i>, which may well be made to flow out and collected appropriately by sucking or by cutting out a part of the peripheral wall <b>38</b><i>m</i>. A terminal section of the flow path <b>38</b><i>i </i>located close to the discharge surface <b>38</b><i>l </i>is preferably so formed as to be substantially orthogonal relative to the discharge surface <b>38</b><i>l</i>. Then, as a result, when the supply cylinder <b>38</b> is positioned so as to make the discharge surface <b>38</b><i>l </i>squarely face the outer peripheral end facets of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> with a gap s separating them, the flow path <b>38</b><i>i </i>is held in parallel with the outer peripheral gap k at and near the discharge surface <b>38</b><i>l. </i></p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0362">Now the operation of supplying molten solder M<b>1</b> of the above-described supply cylinder <b>38</b> will be described below. The supply apparatus is so arranged that, when molten solder M<b>1</b> is being supplied and flowing in a steady state in the supply cylinder <b>38</b>, the supply apparatus moves along the outer peripheral gap k of glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. The steady state refers to a state where molten solder M<b>1</b> is discharged from the discharge port <b>38</b><i>h </i>onto the top surface of the guide section <b>39</b> and can be injected into the outer peripheral gap k, the discharge port <b>38</b><i>h </i>being substantially filled with molten solder M<b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>. Preferably, the duration of time that is spent from the time when the supply of molten solder M<b>1</b> from the first opening <b>38</b><i>g </i>starts to the time when this steady state is reached is as short as possible. For this reason, the rate of supplying molten solder M<b>1</b> is controlled in such a way that the flow path <b>38</b><i>i </i>is quickly filled with molten solder M<b>1</b> when the supply of molten solder M<b>1</b> is started and the flow of molten solder M<b>1</b> is still in an unsteady state but molten solder M<b>1</b> can satisfactorily fill the outer peripheral gap k in a steady state.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0363">When a supply cylinder <b>38</b> as described above is employed, the supplied clean molten solder M<b>1</b> is then filled into the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>, while the clean molten solder M<b>1</b> is only slightly brought into contact with the external atmosphere at the gap s between the discharge surface <b>38</b><i>l </i>and the corresponding end facets of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> and also in the gaps Gu and Gd. Therefore, the supplied clean molten solder M<b>1</b> contacts the main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> in a state where oxidation thereof is suppressed in the atmosphere. Thus, the supply apparatus of this example is suitable for using SnAgAl based alloy solder that shows an excellent bonding performance with glass by way of oxygen existing to an appropriate extent. To improve the filling performance of molten solder M<b>1</b>, the area of the surface of the guide section <b>39</b> that contacts molten solder M<b>1</b> is preferably subjected to a process for raising its wettability relative to molten solder M<b>1</b>. For example, it is preferably coated with Ag, Cr, Al, Mo, W, V, Nb or Ta. Additionally, it is preferably subjected to a nitriding treatment, which is an anti-corrosion treatment, so that the surface of the guide section <b>39</b> may not be corroded by molten solder M<b>1</b> and impurities may not be mixed into the molten solder M<b>1</b>. The surface of the flow path <b>38</b><i>i </i>is also preferably subjected to those treatments.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0364">Now, the operation of supplying molten solder M<b>1</b> to the outer peripheral gap k of the supply apparatus of this example will be described below. The glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> that are laid one above the other with a gap maintaining member Q having a predetermined size interposed between them are placed in position on a table that contains a heat emitting body and movable in the two axial directions of the X-axis and the Y-axis and the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are heated to about the melting temperature of molten solder M<b>1</b>. The trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>of the guide section <b>39</b> of the supply cylinder <b>38</b> is inserted into a predetermined position in the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> located at or near one of the edges of each of them and the supply cylinder <b>38</b> is moved so as to produce a predetermined gap s between the corresponding end facets of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> and the discharge surface <b>38</b><i>l</i>. The position of the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>is adjusted in advance so that the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>comes to a position at the vertical center of the outer peripheral gap k or its vicinity at this time, although it is difficult to rigorously adjust the position so as to make it agree with the center of the outer peripheral gap k. However, if the position is not adjusted satisfactorily, some of the contact sections <b>39</b><i>b </i>can hit the end facet of the glass substrate w<b>3</b> or w<b>4</b> if the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>is successfully inserted into the outer peripheral gap k. The supply cylinder <b>38</b> is supported by a floating mechanism in terms of its vertical position and the contact sections <b>39</b><i>b </i>are beveled to show bevels c so that the contact sections <b>39</b><i>b </i>can be inserted into the outer peripheral gap k with ease. Then, as a result, the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>is placed substantially at the vertical center of the outer peripheral gap k and the gap Gu and the gap Gd between the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>and the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> become equal to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0365">Clean molten solder M<b>1</b> is supplied to the flow path <b>38</b><i>i </i>and starts to be discharged from the discharge port <b>38</b><i>h </i>at a predetermined flow rate. A steady state is reached within a short period of time and the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> can be moved quickly in a direction (the X-direction) at a predetermined speed in order to supply molten solder M<b>1</b> to one of the sides of the outer peripheral gap k. Meanwhile, molten solder M<b>1</b> is injected into the gaps Gu and Gd and supplied into the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. Since the contact sections <b>39</b><i>b </i>are fitted into the outer peripheral gap k and held in a floating state, they follow the vertical positional fluctuations of the outer peripheral gap k that can arise when the glass substrate w<b>4</b> has a varying thickness and/or the table surface has vertical undulations in the X-direction, and the sizes of the gaps Gu and Gd are maintained. Then, as a result, a substantially same quantity of molten solder M<b>1</b> is injected both along the top surface and along the bottom surface of the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>so that the molten solder M<b>1</b> that moves as the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>moves shows a same flow state both in the gap Gu and in the gap Gd and hence molten solder M<b>1</b> is supplied equally to the main surface of the glass substrate w<b>3</b> and to the main surface of the glass substrate w<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0366">Besides, as ultrasonic vibrations are employed and applied to the guide section <b>39</b> during a molten solder filling operation, both the wettability of the guide section <b>39</b> and that of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> relative to molten solder M<b>1</b> are improved so that molten solder M<b>1</b> is smoothly supplied if the gaps Gu and Gd are narrow. The ultrasonic vibrations also act on the main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> by way of molten solder M<b>1</b> to remove the air bubbles and the foreign objects such as oxide film existing at the contact interfaces of molten solder M<b>1</b> and the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. Then, the bonding performance of molten solder M<b>1</b> relative to the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> is improved to effectively improve the bonding strength of the glass panel W.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0367">As the operation of supplying molten solder M<b>1</b> to one of the sides of the outer peripheral gap k is completed in a manner as described above, the casing <b>38</b><i>e </i>equipped with the supply cylinder <b>38</b> is driven to turn by 90&#xb0; in the horizontal direction and then the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are driven to move horizontally in the direction of a side thereof that is orthogonal to the above-described side. Then, molten solder M<b>1</b> is supplied into the outer peripheral gap k at this side as in the case of the above-described side. This operation is repeated sequentially at each of the sides and molten solder M<b>1</b> is supplied to all the sides of the outer peripheral gap k of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. As the operation of supplying molten solder M<b>1</b> to the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> is completed, the table on which the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are placed is moved to the outside. The glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are then removed from the table that is moved to the outside but no molten solder M<b>1</b> is adhering to the table so that no operation is required to remove solder from the table.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0368">Subsequently, another table on which another pair of glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are placed and heated for preparation is brought in and another operation of supplying molten solder M<b>1</b> same as the above-described operation is started to the outer peripheral gap k of the new glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b>. Note, however, that the vertical position of the outer peripheral gap k of the new glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> can be different from the position of the outer peripheral gap k of the former glass substrates due to the difference of thickness between the new and old glass substrates w<b>4</b> and/or the difference of state where glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> are fitted to the table. If such is the case, the supply apparatus of this example can insert the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>into the vertical center position of the outer peripheral gap k and fill the outer peripheral gap k with molten solder M<b>1</b> in a state where the size of the gaps Gu and Gd is maintained because the supply cylinder <b>38</b> is vertically supported by a floating mechanism and the contact sections <b>39</b><i>b </i>are provided with bevels c.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0369">When the guide section <b>39</b> moves along the outer peripheral gap k, molten solder M<b>1</b> permeates between the contact sections <b>39</b><i>b </i>and the main surfaces of the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> due to the capillary phenomenon. After the contact sections <b>39</b><i>b </i>contact and pass the respective main surfaces, molten solder M<b>1</b> flows from the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>and supplied to the contact regions of the contact sections <b>39</b><i>b </i>as it is drawn by the molten solder M<b>1</b> that permeates. Molten solder M<b>1</b> may not be supplied to all the contact regions of the contact sections if the length of the contact sections <b>39</b><i>b </i>is large so that the length of the contact sections <b>39</b><i>b </i>is preferably small and suitably about 10 to 20% of the width of the bonding section n. The top and bottom surfaces of the contact sections <b>39</b><i>b </i>may not necessarily be planes as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref> but may alternatively be planes where grooves are formed or curved surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0370">In the supply apparatus of Example No. 5, projecting bodies <b>39</b><i>a </i>are provided in the guide section <b>39</b> so as to operate as contact sections <b>39</b><i>b </i>and inserted into the supply cylinder <b>38</b> in order to maintain the gaps Gu and Gd between the trowel section <b>39</b><i>d </i>and the glass substrates w<b>3</b> and w<b>4</b> to respective constant values. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49(</figref><i>a</i>), projecting bodies <b>39</b><i>a </i>may alternatively be formed only to a small distance from the corresponding end facet of the supply cylinder <b>45</b> so as to operate as contact sections <b>39</b><i>b </i>instead of the above-described projecting bodies <b>39</b><i>a </i>that are inserted into the supply cylinder <b>45</b>. Still alternatively, projecting bodies <b>39</b><i>a </i>may be formed at a front end part of the plate-shaped body <b>39</b><i>c </i>so as to operate as contact sections <b>39</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49(</figref><i>b</i>). Still alternatively, only a plate-shaped body <b>47</b><i>a </i>having a same thickness like the supply cylinder <b>47</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49(</figref><i>c</i>) may be used without any projecting bodies. Such an arrangement can find applications where small size glass substrates having a side of several to tens of several centimeters and scarcely showing variances of thickness are employed with a glass substrate moving mechanism that vibrates minimally when guiding glass substrates and the gaps involved in the supply apparatus fluctuate only to a negligible extent. In such a case, a supply apparatus may not necessarily require a floating mechanism for supporting the supply cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0371">Additionally, it is only necessary for the guide section <b>39</b> to be fitted to the supply cylinder so as to cross the discharge port <b>38</b><i>h</i>. In other words, the guide section <b>39</b> may not necessarily be fitted substantially at the vertical center and its fitting position may alternatively be displaced upwardly or downwardly. When the guide section <b>39</b> is displaced downwardly, for example, the leakage quantity of molten solder flowing down from the gap between the discharge surface of the supply cylinder and the glass substrates by gravity can be reduced, and the guide section is attached to the position where the molten solder from the discharge port does not leak from the lower side of the guide section. In such a case, the guide section is preferably provided with an appropriate through hole or a through groove so that molten solder may flow from the top surface side to the bottom surface side thereof.</p>
