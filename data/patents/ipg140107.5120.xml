<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) to a Korean patent application filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Feb. 16, 2010 and assigned Serial No. 10-2010-0013881, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for transmitting and receiving data in a multi-carrier mobile communication system. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for transmitting and receiving data over a Carrier Component (CC).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To support the increase in the amount of data in current mobile communications, extensive research has been conducted to maximize transmission efficiency, increase system capacity, and ensure instantaneous high data rates. To serve these purposes, it is generally more efficient to transmit and receive data over a plurality of carriers than over a single carrier as is conventionally done. Accordingly, many techniques have been proposed to transmit and receive data over a plurality of carriers.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) or Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16m standard, which is a candidate for the 4th Generation (4G) mobile communication system, International Mobile Telecommunications-Advanced (IMT-A), proposed Carrier Aggregation (CA) as a main 4G evolution technology. CA is a technique that uses a plurality of successive or scattered frequency bands as a single frequency band. Since a specific Mobile Station (MS) can transmit and receive data simultaneously over a plurality of CCs according to the CA technology, an instantaneous peak data rate is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the increase of an instantaneous peak data rate on a subframe basis is not so meaningful to a packet-based mobile communication system. Rather, it is expected that the CC technology is used to distribute an increased system load using additional CCs, if a service is not provided reliably with existing limited resources due to the increased system load. Compared to conventional data transmission and reception over a single CC, data transmission and reception over multiple CCs will increase the structural complexity of a transmitter and a receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Mobile communication systems such as LTE and IEEE 802.16m systems adopt Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) as a multiple access scheme. The LTE system uses a channel bandwidth of 1.25 to 20 MHz and supports a data rate of up to 100 Mbps. The LTE system defines a Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) for carrying control information needed to receive data on a Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Now a description will be given of an operation of an MS in a typical system that transmits and receives data over multiple CCs.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an operation of an MS for receiving data in a mobile communication system where data is transmitted and received over multiple CCs in the case where each CC carries a control channel according to the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, reference numeral <b>100</b> denotes an operation of an MS over a first CC <b>102</b> (CC<b>1</b>) and reference numeral <b>150</b> denotes an operation of the MS over a second CC <b>152</b> (CC<b>2</b>). The CC<b>1</b> and CC<b>2</b> are both configured as a subframe with a control channel carrying Resource Allocation Information (RAI) and a data channel carrying data.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Upon receipt of CC<b>1</b>, the MS acquires control information about CC<b>1</b> during a first time period <b>106</b> (T<b>1</b>). During a second time period <b>108</b> (T<b>2</b>), the MS decodes the control information and detects resources allocated to the MS according to the decoded control information. The MS then buffers all DownLink (DL) data received on CC<b>1</b>. The reason for buffering all DL data during the time period T<b>2</b> is that the MS does not know a resource area to which a data channel has been allocated because the control information decoding is not completed. Therefore, all DL data received until the control information decoding is completed should be buffered.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">During a third time period <b>110</b> (T<b>3</b>), the MS receives data in a resource area <b>114</b> of subframe <b>1</b>, indicated by the completely decoded control information, as denoted by reference numeral <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Upon receipt of CC<b>2</b>, the MS acquires control information about CC<b>2</b> during a fourth time period <b>154</b> (T<b>4</b>). During a fifth time period <b>156</b> (T<b>5</b>), the MS decodes the control information and detects a resource area <b>160</b> allocated to the MS according to the decoded control information, as indicated by reference numeral <b>158</b>. The MS then buffers all DL data received on CC<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an operation of an MS for receiving data in a mobile communication system where data is transmitted and received over multiple CCs in the case where some CCs do not carry a control channel according to the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, reference numeral <b>200</b> denotes an operation of an MS over a first CC <b>202</b> (CC<b>1</b>) and reference numeral <b>250</b> denotes an operation of an MS over a second CC <b>252</b> (CC<b>2</b>). CC<b>1</b> is configured as a subframe including a control channel carrying Resource Allocation Information (RAI) and a data channel carrying data, whereas CC<b>2</b> is configured as a subframe including only a data channel. It is assumed herein that the control channel of CC<b>1</b> also carries RAI indicating resources to which the data channel of CC<b>2</b> is allocated. Accordingly, to receive data on CC<b>2</b>, the MS should first acquire the RAI about CC<b>2</b> from the control channel of CC<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Upon receipt of CC<b>1</b>, the MS acquires control information of CC<b>1</b> during a time period <b>204</b> (T<b>1</b>). During a time period <b>206</b> (T<b>2</b>), the MS decodes the control information and detects an allocated resource area using the decoded control information. At the same time, the MS buffers all DL data received on the data channel of CC<b>1</b>. The reason for buffering all DL data during the time period T<b>2</b> is that the MS does not know the resource area to which the data channel has been allocated because the control information decoding is not completed. Therefore, all DL data received until the control information decoding is completed should be buffered.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">During a time period <b>208</b> (T<b>3</b>), the MS receives data in a resource area <b>212</b> of subframe <b>1</b>, indicated by the completely decoded control information, as denoted by reference numeral <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Upon receipt of CC<b>2</b>, the MS buffers DL data received across a total bandwidth of CC<b>2</b> until the control information of CC<b>1</b> is completely decoded, because the MS does not know resources allocated to the data channel of CC<b>2</b>, as indicated by reference numeral <b>254</b>. After the decoding of the control information of CC<b>1</b> is completed, the MS receives data in allocated resources <b>260</b> indicated by the control information, as indicated by reference numeral <b>258</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, as the number of CCs increases, several problems occur that decrease the efficiency of an MS and increase the complexity and power consumption of the MS:</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">1) Since the design complexity of an MS is increased due to data transmission and reception over a wide frequency band and data demodulation, the cost of the MS is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">2) An increased Peak-to-Average Power Ratio of a transmitter decreases power efficiency, causes distortion, and increases an amplifier cost.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">3) Because data is transmitted with limited transmission power in a broad band, coverage performance is degraded.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">4) More data is buffered.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">5) The number of control signal processes and blind decoding searches increase.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The problems listed as 4) and 5) will be described in greater detail.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">With respect to the increase of data buffering, a control channel carrying RAI is generally allocated to a subframe corresponding to a data transmission time. To receive DL data, the MS should temporarily buffer all data received across a total band during a time period (e.g. T<b>2</b> and T<b>5</b>) in which the MS decodes a control channel and detects an allocated resource area based on the decoded control channel. Since the MS should buffer more data for more CCs, a memory requirement is increased and as a consequence, the volume of computation is also increased. The buffering problem gets worse when a control channel is multiplexed with a data channel in Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) in the IEEE 802.16m system.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With respect to the increase in the number of control signal processes and blind decoding searches, a control channel carries RAI for a plurality of MSs. To transmit RAI to a specific MS, a Base Station (BS) should transmit an Identifier (ID) of the MS along with the RAI. Due to the resulting huge overload, the LTE or IEEE 802.16m system masks a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) added to control information by the ID of an MS. Accordingly, the specific MS should detect its control information through blind decoding of all resource areas of a control channel. This blind decoding search requires a large amount of computation. In the illustrated case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in which each CC has a control channel, the increase of computation volume in turn increases a time period taken to decode the control channel. As a result, the amount of buffered data or a Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQquest (HARQ) process latency is increased, thereby degrading performance.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Therefore, data transmission and reception over multiple CCs imposes a constraint on an MS that is more sensitive to cost and efficiency than a BS. Because using CA for the purpose of distributing overall system load over a plurality of CCs is more promising than for the purpose of simultaneously transmitting data over a plurality of CCs at one time, a more reasonable design is desired. There exists a pressing need for designing an MS capable of transmitting one CC or a small number of CCs simultaneously, instead of an MS that simultaneously processes multiple CCs, and a system that distributes system load well across a plurality of CCs.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The following description with reference to the accompanying drawings is provided to assist in a comprehensive understanding of exemplary embodiments of the invention as defined by the claims and their equivalents. It includes various specific details to assist in that understanding, but these are to be regarded as merely exemplary. Accordingly, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that various changes and modifications of the embodiments described herein can be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. In addition, descriptions of well-known functions and constructions may be omitted for clarity and conciseness.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The terms and words used in the following description and claims are not limited to the bibliographical meanings, but are merely used by the inventor to enable a clear and consistent understanding of the invention. Accordingly, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the following description of exemplary embodiments of the present invention is provided for illustration purposes only and not for the purpose of limiting the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">It is to be understood that the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to &#x201c;a component surface&#x201d; includes reference to one or more of such surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the number of Carrier Components (CCs) which a Mobile Station (MS) can simultaneously transmit and receive is limited to or below a predetermined value and thus a Base Station (BS) can transmit data to the MS over a part of entire CCs, in order to mitigate the design complexity of MSs that transmit and receive data over a plurality of CCs.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are applicable according to a method for transmitting control information over CCs. If the number of CCs supported by a BS is different from the number of CCs supported by an MS, a resource allocation method and resource allocation information transmission method for load balancing of CCs are considered in the following two cases.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">One of the two cases is that every CC includes control information, that is, its Resource Allocation Information (RAI), and the other case is that some CCs do not include control information and thus a specific CC carries control information, that is, RAI of another CC in its control information. In the latter case, as control information included in a CC may indicate resources for another CC, some CCs may not include control information.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The above-described two cases will be described below according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, an MS determines the number of CCs that the MS can simultaneously transmit and receive (N_Max_CC_MS) and report N_Max_CC_MS to a BS. How the MS determines N_Max_CC_MS depends on system capacity, data traffic characteristics, and MS capability.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">After determining N_Max_CC_MS, the MS reports N_Max_CC_MS to the BS. N_Max_CC_MS may be transmitted during negotiation between the MS and the BS or during initial access to the BS. The transmission of N_Max_CC_MS may be periodic or non-periodic. Upon receipt of N_Max_CC_MS, the BS determines the number of CCs that it can simultaneously allocate (N_Max_CC_BS) and transmits monitoring CC set information indicating the determined CCs available for simultaneous data transmission to the MS.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram illustrating a signal flow for data transmission and reception on a plurality of CCs between an MS and a BS according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an MS <b>300</b> determines N_Max_CC_MS in step <b>304</b> and reports N_Max_CC_MS to a BS <b>302</b> in step <b>306</b>. N_Max_CC_MS may be transmitted in a monitoring CC set request message. Upon receipt of N_Max_CC_MS, the BS <b>302</b> determines N_Max_CC_BS in step <b>308</b>. N_Max_CC_BS should be equal to or less than N_Max_CC_MS.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">After determining N_Max_CC_BS, the BS <b>302</b> transmits monitoring CC set information indicating CCs corresponding to N_Max_CC_BS to the MS <b>300</b> in step <b>310</b>. The monitoring CC set information may include N_Max_CC_BS and Identifiers (IDs) identifying CCs corresponding to N_Max_CC_BS in the monitoring CC set information. If the MS <b>300</b> can determine N_Max_CC_BS using the IDs alone, the monitoring CC set information may include only the IDs identifying the CCs corresponding to N_Max_CC_BS.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Upon receipt of the monitoring CC set information, the MS monitors CCs indicated by the monitoring CC set information and decodes resource allocation information received over the CCs in step <b>311</b>. Monitoring CCs denotes that data received over the CCs is temporarily buffered until control information about the CCs is decoded. The data is transmitted over the monitoring CCs. Because the MS <b>300</b> does not know which monitoring CC is carrying data for the MS <b>300</b>, the MS <b>300</b> should temporarily buffer the data received over the monitoring CCs until it interprets control information about the monitoring CCs.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In step <b>312</b>, the MS <b>300</b> receives data transmitted from the BS <b>302</b> based on the decoded resource allocation information.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram illustrating a signal flow for notifying an MS of changed monitoring CC set information when a BS changes monitoring CC set information, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a BS <b>402</b> determines whether a monitoring CC set has been changed in step <b>404</b>. If the monitoring CC set has been changed, the BS <b>402</b> transmits monitoring CC set replacement information to an MS <b>400</b> in step <b>406</b>. The monitoring CC set replacement information may include the ID of a CC removed from previously transmitted monitoring CC set information (removed CC ID) and/or the ID of a CC that will substitute for the removed CC ID (replaced CC ID). If the monitoring CC has not been changed, the procedure ends.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the monitoring CC set replacement information may have the following configuration illustrated in Table 1.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Upon receipt of the monitoring CC set replacement information, the MS <b>400</b> changes existing CCs to changed CCs included in the monitoring CC set replacement information in step <b>408</b> and transmits a Replace Confirm message indicating successful CC replacement to the BS <b>402</b> in step <b>410</b>. If the BS <b>402</b> fails to receive the Replace Confirm message within a predetermined time, the BS <b>402</b> retransmits the monitoring CC set replacement information to the MS <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The MS <b>400</b> may transmit data to or receive data from the BS <b>402</b> over the changed CCs in step <b>412</b>.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method for activating a maximum CC number timer after an MS transmits a maximum CC number to a BS according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, after transmitting a monitoring CC set request message to the BS in step <b>500</b>, the MS activates a maximum CC number timer (a T_N_Max_CC_MS timer) in step <b>502</b>. The monitoring CC set request message includes a maximum number of CCs (N_Max_CC_MS). The MS determines whether monitoring CC set information has been received from the BS in step <b>504</b>. Upon receipt of the monitoring CC set information, the MS initializes the T_N_Max_CC_MS timer because the MS does not need to retransmit the monitoring CC set request message in step <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">On the other hand, if the MS fails to receive the monitoring CC set information from the BS in step <b>504</b>, the MS determines whether the T_N_Max_CC_MS timer has expired in step <b>508</b>.

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Upon expiration of the T_N_Max_CC_MS timer in step <b>508</b>, the MS retransmits the monitoring CC set request message to the BS, determining that the BS has failed to receive N_Max_CC_MS in step <b>510</b>. A timer value for expiration of the T_N_Max_CC_MS timer may be preset or indicated to the MS by predetermined signaling by the BS.</p>

The BS <b>602</b> transmits additional information to the MS <b>600</b> in addition to the monitoring CC set information. Not every CC allocated by the BS <b>602</b> includes RAI, and thus CCs including RAI should be indicated to the MS <b>600</b>. Accordingly, the BS <b>602</b> transmits to the MS <b>600</b> RAI monitoring CC set (RAI_Monitoring_CC_Set) information indicating CCs having RAI among CCs indicated by the monitoring CC set information in step <b>608</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In steps <b>610</b> and <b>612</b>, the MS <b>600</b> and the BS <b>602</b> detect a short latency CC set (SL_CC_Set) and a long latency CC set (LL_CC_Set) from the RAI_Monitoring_CC_Set information. The MS <b>600</b> and the BS <b>602</b> transmit and receive data using the SL_CC_Set and the LL_CC_Set in step <b>614</b>.

If the RAI_Monitoring_CC_Set information has been changed, the BS <b>702</b> transmits RAI monitoring CC set replacement (RAI_Monitoring_CC_Replace) information to the MS <b>700</b> in step <b>706</b>. The RAI_Monitoring_CC_Replace information may include the ID of a CC removed from the RAI_Monitoring_CC_Set information (removed CC ID) and/or the ID of a CC that will substitute for the removed CC ID (replaced CC ID).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Upon receipt of the RAI_Monitoring_CC_Replace information, the MS <b>700</b> replaces an existing RAI monitoring CC set in step <b>708</b> and transmits a Replace Confirm message indicating successful CC replacement to the BS <b>702</b> in step <b>710</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an operation for receiving data over CCs allocated by a BS at an MS according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. &#x2018;SL CC&#x2019; denotes a monitoring CC, and &#x2018;LLC CC&#x2019; denotes a CC other than a monitoring CC set.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, reference numeral <b>800</b> denotes an operation of the MS over an SL CC <b>802</b> and reference numeral <b>850</b> denotes an operation of the MS over an LL CC <b>852</b>. When resources are allocated using an SL CC, a BS transmits RAI over a CC of an RAI monitoring CC set in a first subframe. The RAI indicates resources allocated to a subframe spaced from the first subframe by time T<b>1</b>, for data transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">When resources are allocated using an LL CC, an MS transmits RAI over a CC of an RAI monitoring CC set in a second subframe. The RAI indicates resources for data transmission allocated to a subframe spaced from the second subframe by time &#x3c4;<b>2</b>. &#x3c4;<b>2</b> is always greater than &#x3c4;<b>1</b>. It is assumed herein that &#x3c4;<b>1</b>=0 and &#x3c4;<b>2</b>=1. If &#x3c4;<b>1</b>=0, then RAI included in a subframe indicates resources allocated to the same subframe, for data transmission. If &#x3c4;<b>2</b>=1, then RAI included in a subframe indicates resources allocated to the next subframe, for data transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Upon receipt of a subframe <b>826</b> (subframe <b>1</b> <b>826</b>), the MS receives all control information of RAI <b>814</b> included in the SL CC <b>802</b> during a first time period <b>804</b> (T<b>1</b>). While only one SL CC <b>802</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the MS actually receives control information over all SL CCs during the time period T<b>1</b>. Then the MS decodes the control information received during the time period T<b>1</b>, detects resources allocated to the MS based on the decoded control information, and buffers all DL data received over the SL CC <b>802</b>, during a second time period <b>806</b> (T<b>2</b>). The reason for buffering all DL data during the time period T<b>2</b> is that the MS does not know a resource area to which a data channel has been allocated because the control information decoding is not completed. Therefore, all DL data received until the control information decoding is completed should be buffered.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">During a third time period <b>808</b> (T<b>3</b>), the MS locates allocated resources <b>816</b> in the SL CC <b>802</b> and allocated resources <b>860</b> in the LL CC <b>852</b> using the control information completely decoded during the time period T<b>2</b>, as indicated by reference numerals <b>822</b> and <b>824</b>. The MS receives data in the allocated resources <b>816</b> in subframe <b>1</b> being the same frame including the decoded control information. Then the MS decodes the received data during a fourth time period <b>810</b> (T<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The MS performs the same operation on a second subframe <b>828</b> (subframe <b>2</b> <b>828</b>). The MS acquires RAI from allocation information <b>820</b> of subframe <b>2</b> <b>828</b> and receives data in a resource area indicated by the RAI.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The operation <b>850</b> of the MS over the LL CC <b>852</b> will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Upon receipt of the LL CC <b>852</b> corresponding to subframe <b>1</b> <b>864</b>, the MS does not perform any operation on the LL CC <b>852</b>, as indicated by reference numeral <b>851</b>. It is because the MS has determined from RAI of an SL CC of a previous subframe that RAI <b>854</b> and DL data <b>856</b> of subframe <b>1</b> <b>864</b> are not for the MS. If the DL data <b>856</b> of the LL CC <b>852</b> in subframe <b>1</b> <b>864</b> is for the MS, the MS determines from RAI of an SL CC of a subframe previous to subframe <b>1</b> <b>864</b> that the DL data <b>856</b> transmitted in allocated resources of subframe <b>1</b> <b>864</b> is for the MS and receives and decodes the DL data <b>856</b>. This case is not that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and thus the MS does not perform any operation on the LL CC <b>852</b> of subframe <b>1</b> <b>864</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">During a fifth time period <b>868</b> (T<b>5</b>), the MS receives data in the allocated resources <b>860</b> indicated by the RAI decoded during the time period T<b>2</b>, spaced from the RAI <b>814</b> of the SL CC <b>802</b> by the time &#x3c4;<b>2</b> in subframe <b>2</b> <b>866</b>, as indicated by reference numeral <b>824</b>.
