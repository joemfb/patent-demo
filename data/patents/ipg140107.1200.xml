<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2012-075314, which was filed on Mar. 29, 2012, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a sheet supply apparatus in which a sheet supply roller is come into abutting contact with a sheet by a pivot of an arm.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A sheet supply apparatus which supplies a sheet placed on a sheet placed member by a rotation of the sheet supply roller is known. The sheet supply apparatus is used for an image recording apparatus which carries a sheet and records an image on the sheet, and for a scanner which carries a sheet (an image recorded sheet) and scans an image on the sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some sheet supply apparatuses, the sheet supply roller is come into abutting contact with a sheet. It is known that, in such a sheet supply apparatus, a friction member configured to apply a friction force to the sheet is provided in the sheet placed member in order to decrease a probability of a double-feeding of the sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A conventional art discloses a sheet supply apparatus provided with a separation pad which can slide in a sheet supply direction for a sheet in order to prevent an occurrence of a no-feeding of the sheet. There is a sheet supply apparatus provided with a separation pad which can slide in a sheet supply direction in order to prevent an occurrence of a no-feeding of the sheet. The separation pad includes a block pad having a high friction generating face generating a relatively large friction force, and a separation pad base having a low friction generating face generating a relatively small friction force. The block pad is provided in an upstream side of the small friction face in the sheet supply direction. The separation pad is slidably provided such that it slides to a position at which the block pad faces to the sheet supply roller and to a position at which the small friction face faces to the sheet supply roller. A spring pushes the block pad toward the position at which the block pad faces to the sheet supply roller.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Since the separation pad is slidably provided, an angle of the arm does not vary, thereby causing no increase of a conveying force applied to the sheet. Therefore, it takes a relatively long time to supply the sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is carried out in the light of such a problem, therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a sheet supply apparatus capable of preventing an occurrence of the no-feeding of the sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The object indicated above may be achieved according to the present invention which provides a sheet supply apparatus comprising: a sheet support portion configured to support at least one sheet; a supporting shaft supported by a main body of the sheet supply apparatus; an arm configured to pivot around the supporting shaft; a sheet supply roller provided at a distal end of the arm and configured to supply the at least one sheet in a sheet supply direction in which the at least one sheet is supplied; and a contact portion fixed to the sheet support portion and facing to the sheet supply roller, wherein the contact portion comprises: a first contact portion; and a second contact portion disposed in an upstream side of the first contact portion in the sheet supply direction and having a friction coefficient smaller than a friction coefficient of the first contact portion, wherein the sheet supply roller is configured to move from a first position at which the sheet supply roller faces to the first contact portion to a second position at which the sheet supply roller faces to the second contact portion, by an elastic deformation of at least one of the sheet support portion, the contact portion, the supporting shaft, the arm, and the sheet supply roller.</p>

The pair of side guides <b>61</b> is moved to respective positions by a user in order to fit to a size of the placed sheets <b>6</b>. Accordingly, the sheets <b>6</b> are positioned in a center positioning manner. The center positioning manner is a manner in which the sheets <b>6</b> are positioned so that centers of the sheets <b>6</b> in the left-right direction <b>9</b> are aligned at a center of the bottom plate <b>51</b> in the left-right direction <b>9</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Owing to the curved face <b>47</b>, the recess portion <b>45</b> is deeper at an upstream side than a downstream side in the sheet supply direction <b>37</b>. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> by a dash line, a downstream end of a top face of the contact portion <b>80</b> in the sheet supply direction <b>37</b> is positioned higher than the sheet placed face <b>59</b>, and an upstream end of the top face of the contact portion <b>80</b> is positioned at the same height as the sheet placed face <b>59</b>. Accordingly, when the user slides the sheet <b>6</b>, during a supply of the sheet <b>6</b>, from an upstream position of the contact portion <b>80</b> to a downstream position of the contact portion <b>80</b> in the sheet supply direction <b>37</b> (from the front to the rear), the sheet <b>6</b> is not caught by the contact portion <b>80</b>.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The contact portion <b>80</b> is constituted by a first contact portion <b>81</b> and a second contact portion <b>82</b> which are different from each other in the friction coefficient with respect to the sheet <b>6</b>, in order to prevent an occurrence of the no-feeding in which the sheet <b>6</b> is not supplied even though the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> is driven. This is described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Each of the first contact portion <b>81</b> and the second contact portion <b>82</b> is formed to have a rectangular shape in a planar view. The first contact portion <b>81</b> is placed on the flat face <b>46</b> and faces to the first roller <b>23</b> and the second roller <b>24</b> in the up-down direction <b>7</b>. The second contact portion <b>82</b> is placed on both of the flat face <b>46</b> and the curved face <b>47</b>, and is positioned in an upstream side of the first contact portion <b>81</b> in the sheet supply direction <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The friction coefficient of the first contact portion <b>81</b> with respect to the sheet <b>6</b> is set according to a kind of the sheet <b>6</b> to be frequently conveyed, in order to prevent an occurrence of the double-feeding. In particular, the first contact portion <b>81</b> is made of a material whose friction coefficient had been set so that a friction force applied by the contact portion <b>80</b> to the sheet <b>6</b> is smaller than a conveying force of the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> (the first roller <b>23</b> and the second roller <b>24</b>) and is larger than a friction force between the sheets <b>6</b>. For example, the sheet <b>6</b> may be a plain paper. In this embodiment, the friction coefficient of the first contact portion <b>81</b> is set approximately at a friction coefficient of a gloss paper. As described above, since the friction coefficient of the sheet supply tray <b>14</b> is reduced in order to decrease the slide resistance generating between the arm <b>22</b> and the sheet supply tray <b>14</b> and in order to decrease the friction force generating between the sheet <b>6</b> and the inclined plate <b>55</b>, the friction coefficient of the first contact portion <b>81</b> is larger than the friction coefficient of the sheet supply tray <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">On the other hand, the friction coefficient of the second contact portion <b>82</b> with respect to the sheet <b>6</b> is, as described later, smaller than the friction coefficient of the first contact portion <b>81</b> with respect to the sheet <b>6</b> in order to prevent an occurrence of the no-feeding.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The first contact portion <b>81</b> and the second contact portion <b>82</b> have the same thickness in order to form no step between the first contact portion <b>81</b> and the second contact portion <b>82</b> on the top face of the contact portion <b>80</b>. The contact portion <b>80</b> is constituted by a first pad <b>91</b>, a second pad <b>92</b>, a third pad <b>93</b>, and a fourth pad <b>94</b> each of which is like a plate, in order that the first contact portion <b>81</b> and the second contact portion <b>82</b> have the same thickness irrespective of a dimension error which may occur in manufacturing, and in order that the friction coefficients of the contact portions <b>81</b>, <b>82</b> are different from each other. The detailed description is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a first cork member <b>95</b> like a plate having a rectangular shape in a planar view is divided into two pieces. The first cork member <b>95</b> has a groove <b>97</b> which contributes to an easy divide. One of the two pieces serves as the first pad <b>91</b> and the other of the two pieces serves as the third pad <b>93</b>. This enables a manufacture of the first pad <b>91</b> and the third pad <b>93</b> having the same shape (rectangular shape) and the approximately same thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A second cork member <b>96</b> having the friction coefficient smaller than the friction coefficient of the first cork member <b>95</b> and having the same shape as the first cork member <b>95</b> is divided into two pieces. One of the two pieces serves as the second pad <b>92</b> and the other of the two pieces serves as the fourth pad <b>94</b>. This enables a manufacture of the second pad <b>92</b> and the fourth pad <b>94</b> which have the same shape (rectangular shape) and the approximately same thickness, and whose friction coefficient is smaller than the friction coefficient of the first pad <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the fourth pad <b>94</b> is adhered on the flat face <b>46</b>, and the third pad <b>93</b> is adhered on the flat face <b>46</b> and the curved face <b>47</b>. The first pad <b>91</b> is adhered on the fourth pad <b>94</b>, and the second pad <b>92</b> is adhered on the third pad <b>93</b>. The first pad <b>91</b> and the fourth pad <b>94</b> stacked in the up-down direction <b>7</b> forms the first contact portion <b>81</b>. The second pad <b>92</b> and the third pad <b>93</b> stacked in the up-down direction <b>7</b> forms the second contact portion <b>82</b>. Incidentally, as long as the first pad <b>91</b> and the fourth pad <b>94</b> have the same shape and the second pad <b>92</b> and the third pad <b>93</b> have the same shape, the first pad <b>91</b> and the second pad <b>92</b> may have different lengths from each other in the front-rear direction <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Forming the contact portion <b>80</b> as described above enables the first contact portion <b>81</b> and the second contact portion <b>82</b> to have the same thickness irrespective of a dimension error which may occur in manufacturing, and enables the friction coefficients to be different from each other. Accordingly, since the thickness is invariant, it is possible to decrease a probability of a formation of the step on the top face of the contact portion <b>80</b>. This prevents an occurrence of the no-feeding of the sheet. This is later described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The double-feeding and the no-feeding are described below. When more than several pieces of sheets <b>6</b> (for example, more than three pieces of sheets <b>6</b>) are placed on the sheet supply tray <b>14</b>, the separating protrusion pieces <b>56</b> provided on the inclined plate <b>55</b> come into abutting contact with the sheets <b>6</b>, thereby preventing the double-feeding.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">When not more than several pieces of sheets <b>6</b> (for example, from one piece to three pieces of sheets <b>6</b>) are placed on the sheet supply tray <b>14</b>, the friction force applied by the contact portion <b>80</b> to the sheet <b>6</b> and, and the abutting contact of the separating protrusion pieces <b>56</b> with the sheets <b>6</b> prevent the double-feeding.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Next, the no-feeding which may occur when the last one of the sheets <b>6</b> is left on the sheet supply tray <b>14</b> is described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>. Where the friction force generating between the sheet <b>6</b> and the contact portion <b>80</b> is larger than the conveying force of the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> applied to the sheet <b>6</b>, the sheet <b>6</b> is not be supplied and the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> (the first roller <b>23</b> and the second roller <b>24</b>) rotatingly moves on the sheet <b>6</b>, that is, moves on the sheet <b>6</b> by a rotation of the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> itself. This rotating movement causes an inclination angle &#x3b8; of the arm <b>22</b> relative to the sheet placed face <b>59</b> to become larger. As a result, a contact pressure between the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> and the sheet <b>6</b> (that is, a vertical load applied by the first roller and the second roller to the sheet <b>6</b>) increases via the rotation shaft <b>29</b> supported by the arm <b>22</b> and the holder portion <b>27</b>. As the contact pressure increases, the friction force applied by the first contact portion <b>81</b> to the sheet <b>6</b> increases.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In order to supply the sheet <b>6</b>, the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> needs to applies, to the sheet <b>6</b>, the friction force larger than the friction force applied by the contact portion <b>80</b> to the sheet <b>6</b>. When the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> applies the friction force to the sheet <b>6</b>, a reaction force (friction force) is applied by the sheet <b>6</b> to the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> in a direction opposite to the sheet supply direction <b>37</b>. When this reaction force becomes larger than the friction force applied by the contact portion <b>80</b> to the sheet <b>6</b>, this reaction force causes the rotating movement of the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> in which the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> moves in a direction opposite to the sheet supply direction <b>37</b>. Consequently, this reaction force and the larger contact pressure described above elastically deform at least one of the frame <b>70</b>, the supporting shaft <b>21</b>, the arm <b>22</b>, the sheet supply tray <b>14</b>, the contact portion <b>80</b>, and the sheet supply roller <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Due to the rotating movement, the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> moves from a first position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> in which the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> faces to the first contact portion <b>81</b> in the up-down direction <b>7</b> to a second position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> in which the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> faces to the second contact portion <b>82</b> in the up-down direction <b>7</b>. As a result, the inclination angle &#x3b8; of the arm <b>22</b> relative to the sheet placed face <b>59</b> further increases, and thus the contact pressure between the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> and the sheet <b>6</b> becomes further increases. This causes an increase of the friction force (conveying force) applied by the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> to the sheet <b>6</b>. In addition, when the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> moves to the second position, the friction force is mainly applied by the second contact portion <b>82</b> to the sheet <b>6</b>. Since the friction coefficient of the second contact portion <b>82</b> with respect to the sheet <b>6</b> is smaller than the friction coefficient of the first contact portion <b>81</b> with respect to the sheet <b>6</b>, the friction force (a second friction force) applied by the second contact portion <b>82</b> to the sheet <b>6</b> when the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> is positioned in the second position is smaller than the friction force (a first friction force) applied by the first contact portion <b>81</b> to the sheet <b>6</b> when the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> is positioned in the first position. In other words, the friction coefficient of the second contact potion <b>82</b> which is smaller than the friction coefficient of the first contact portion <b>81</b> is set such that the second friction force is smaller than the first friction force. Based on the rotating movement of the sheet roller <b>19</b> from the first position to the second position, since the conveying force increases and the friction force applied by the contact portion <b>80</b> to the sheet <b>6</b> decreases, the sheet <b>6</b> is promptly supplied and an occurrence of the no-feeding of the sheet is prevented. Additionally, when the sheets <b>6</b> of a few pieces (two or three pieces) are placed on the sheet supply tray <b>14</b>, the friction force applied by the second contact portion <b>82</b> to the sheet <b>6</b> prevents an occurrence of the double-feeding.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As describe above, since the formation of the step between the first contact portion <b>81</b> and the second contact portion <b>82</b> is decreased, an occurrence of the no-feeding is more surely prevented. This is described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">If the step were formed such that a top face of the second contact portion <b>82</b> were lower than a top face of the first contact portion <b>81</b>, the sheet <b>6</b> would not be pressedly contacted with the second contact portion <b>82</b> irrespective of the movement of the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> to the second position. Additionally, if the step were formed such that the top face of the second contact portion <b>82</b> were higher than the top face of the first contact portion <b>81</b>, the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> would become harder to move to the second position. Since the probability of the formation of the step is decreased, the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> promptly moves to the second position and the friction force is applied by the second contact portion <b>82</b> to the sheet <b>6</b>, whereby the occurrence of the no-feeding is more surely prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The sheet <b>6</b> supplied without occurrences of the double-feeding and the no-feeding is conveyed to the platen <b>34</b> by the conveyor roller pair <b>32</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and is intermittently conveyed on the platen <b>34</b>. While the sheet <b>6</b> is intermittently conveyed, the recording portion <b>40</b> selectively ejects ink droplets so as to record an image on the sheet <b>6</b>. The sheet <b>6</b> on which the image has been recorded is discharged by the sheet discharge roller pair <b>33</b> to the sheet discharged tray <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The friction force applied by the contact portion <b>80</b> to the sheet <b>6</b> prevents an occurrence of the double-feeding.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Additionally, since the second contact portion <b>82</b> having the friction coefficient smaller than the friction coefficient of the first contact portion <b>81</b> is positioned in an upstream side of the first contact portion <b>81</b> in the sheet supply direction <b>37</b>, the sheet <b>6</b> is promptly supplied and the occurrence of the no-feeding is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Moreover, since the contact portion <b>80</b> is constituted by the first pad <b>91</b>, the second pad <b>92</b>, the third pad <b>93</b>, and the fourth pad <b>94</b>, it is possible to decrease the probability of the formation of the step on the top face of the contact portion <b>80</b>, whereby the occurrence of the no-feeding is more surely prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">First Modified Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the aforementioned embodiment, an example is described in which the first contact portion <b>81</b> and the second contact portion <b>82</b> each have a rectangular shape in a planar view. In the aforementioned embodiment, a border line L between the top face of the first contact portion <b>81</b> and the top face of the second contact portion <b>82</b> is a straight line extending in the left-right direction <b>9</b>. Where the contact portion <b>80</b> is provided in this manner, the friction force applied by the contact portion <b>80</b> to the sheet <b>6</b> does not decrease until the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) moves beyond the border line L on the way from the first position to the second position. As a result, as long as an amount of the elastic deformations of the frame <b>70</b>, the sheet supply tray <b>14</b>, the contact portion <b>80</b>, supporting shaft <b>21</b>, the arm <b>22</b>, and the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> becomes more than a certain amount so that the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> moves beyond the border line L, the friction force applied by the sheet <b>6</b> to the contact portion <b>80</b> does not decreases. In the first modified embodiment, an example is described in which the friction force applied by the contact portion <b>80</b> to the sheet <b>6</b> decreases in accordance with a distance of a movement in which the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> moves from the first position toward the second position, and thus the amount of the elastic deformations of the sheet supply tray <b>14</b> and so on is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, the contact portion <b>80</b> includes a first pad <b>101</b> which constitutes the first contact portion <b>81</b>, and a second pad <b>102</b> which constitutes the second contact portion <b>82</b>. The first pad <b>101</b> is disposed in a downstream side of the second pad <b>102</b> in the sheet supply direction <b>37</b>. A friction coefficient of the second pad <b>102</b> is smaller than a friction coefficient of the first pad <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The first pad <b>101</b> has a plurality of protrusions <b>103</b> which are provided on an upstream region of the first pad <b>101</b> and are arranged in the left-right direction <b>9</b>.

Similarly, the second pad <b>102</b> has a plurality of protrusions <b>103</b> which are provided on a downstream region of the second pad <b>102</b> and are aligned in the left-right direction <b>9</b>. These protrusions <b>103</b> constitute a part of the concavo-convex portion <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The first pad <b>101</b> and the second pad <b>102</b> are fitted at the concavo-convex portion <b>104</b> to each other. Since the protrusions <b>103</b> each have a triangular shape, the first pad <b>101</b> and the second pad <b>102</b> are fitted to each other without any clearance.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In the contact portion <b>80</b> constituted as described above, a plurality of first regions <b>105</b> indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref> by a hatching of broken lines and a plurality of second regions <b>106</b> indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref> by a hatching of narrow lines are formed on the contact portion <b>80</b>. The first region <b>105</b> is a region in which a length of the first pad <b>101</b> is longer in the sheet supply direction <b>37</b> than a length of the second pad <b>102</b>. The second region <b>106</b> is a region in which the length of the second pad <b>102</b> is longer in the sheet supply direction <b>37</b> than the length of the first pad <b>101</b>. The first region <b>105</b> and the second region <b>106</b> are alternately arranged in the left-right direction <b>9</b>. Since the first region <b>105</b> and the second region <b>106</b> are formed on the contact portion <b>80</b>, the friction force applied by the contact portion <b>80</b> to the sheet <b>6</b> decreases in accordance with the distance of the movement in which the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> moves from the first position toward the second position. This is described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">When the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> is at the first position, the first roller <b>23</b> and the second roller <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) face, in the up-down direction <b>7</b>, to a third region <b>107</b> indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> by a hatching of dotted lines. Therefore, the sheet <b>6</b> is pressedly contacted with the contact portion <b>80</b> at the third region <b>107</b>. A ratio of an area of the first pad <b>101</b> in the third region <b>107</b> to an area of the second pad <b>102</b> in the third region <b>107</b> is larger than a ratio of an area of the first pad <b>101</b> in the fourth region <b>108</b> to an area of the second pad in the fourth region <b>108</b>. The ratio of the areas gradually decreases as a point on the contact portion <b>80</b> moves from the third region <b>107</b> to the fourth region <b>108</b>. Therefore, when the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> moves from the first position to the second position, the friction force applied by the contact portion <b>80</b> to the sheet <b>6</b> decreases in accordance with the distance of the movement of the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> from the third region. Accordingly, the sheet <b>6</b> can be supplied before the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> has reached to the second position. As a result, the sheet <b>6</b> is promptly supplied, and the amount of the elastic deformations of the frame <b>70</b>, the sheet supply tray <b>14</b>, the contact portion <b>80</b>, the supporting shaft <b>21</b>, the arm <b>22</b> and the sheet supply roller <b>19</b> can be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">It is noted that the concavo-convex portion <b>104</b> is not limited to the shape using a triangle but may have any shape in which a ratio of an area of the second contact portion <b>82</b> to an area of the first contact portion <b>81</b> increases as a point on the contact portion <b>80</b> moves toward the upstream side in the sheet supply direction <b>37</b> (to a front in the front-rear direction <b>8</b>). For example, the concavo-convex portion <b>104</b> may have a sawtooth shape (wavy shape) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>. Alternately, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8E</figref>, the concavo-convex portion <b>104</b> may have a step-like shape in which an area of the top face decreases as a point on the contact portion <b>80</b> moves to an end of a protrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In order to decrease the probability of the formation of the step on the top face of the contact portion <b>80</b>, the first contact portion <b>81</b> and the second contact portion <b>82</b> are formed by stacking two pads in the up-down direction <b>7</b> in the same way as the aforementioned embodiment.</p>

<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in the third modified embodiment, an example is described in which a pair of passive rollers <b>83</b>, <b>84</b> aligned in the left-right direction <b>9</b> are provided instead of the second contact portion <b>82</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The passive roller <b>83</b> is placed below the first roller <b>23</b>. The passive roller <b>84</b> is placed below the first roller <b>24</b>. The passive rollers <b>83</b>, <b>84</b> are each formed into a column shape whose central axis extends in the left-right direction <b>9</b>. A rotation shaft not shown in the drawings protrudes leftward and rightward from both side faces of the passive roller <b>83</b>.

As a result, a decrease of the resistance force applied to the sheet <b>6</b> can be achieved more easily than the embodiment provided with the second contact portion <b>82</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), whereby the occurrence of the no-feeding is more surely prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Incidentally, though the example in which the pair of the passive rollers <b>83</b>, <b>84</b> is provided is described above, a single passive roller whose length is equal to a length between both side faces of the recess portion <b>45</b> may be provided.</p>
