<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application relates generally to wireless communication systems and, more specifically, to encoding and decoding data transmitted in a wireless communication system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The rise of high definition and 3D media, the vision of hyper-connectivity, and the shift toward cloud computing have prompted the need for gigabit wireless communication systems. However, implementing high data-rate systems poses a number of engineering challenges. One of the main challenging problems is the design of a high throughput error control scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Low-density-parity-check (LDPC) codes are channel codes used in forward-error-correcting (FEC) schemes. LDPC codes are well known for their good performance and have received a great deal of attention in recent years. This is due to their ability to achieve performance close to the Shannon limit, the ability to design codes which achieve high parallelization in hardware, and their support of high data rates. Consequently, many of the currently active telecommunication standards have LDPC codes in their physical layer FEC scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As data rates in modern communication systems and battery-powered mobile communication and computing devices usage increase, low-power hardware design has become more important. As a result, there is continuing work in the area of improving the power-efficiency and throughput of LDPC encoding and decoding hardware.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Proposed next generation wireless communication systems utilize the extremely high frequencies (EHF) bands. The EHF band includes a range of radio frequencies from around 30 to 300 GHz. The EHF band has wavelengths in the order of a few millimeters. As a result, the band is commonly referred to as the millimeter-wave band (MMB).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is a need for standards of communication in proposed next generation wireless communication systems. In particular, there is a need for an LDPC code family for MMB communications in a wireless network.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A method for constructing a family of low-density-parity-check (LDPC) codes is provided. The method includes identifying a code rate for an LDPC code in the family, identifying a protograph for the LDPC code, and constructing a base matrix for the LDPC code. The base matrix is constructed by replacing each zero in the protograph with a &#x2018;&#x2212;1&#x2019;, selecting a corresponding value for an absolute shift for each one in the protograph based on constraining a number of relative shifts per column of the LDPC code to one and increasing a size of a smallest cycle in a graph of the LDPC code, and replacing each one in the protograph with the corresponding value.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A decoder configured to decode a low-density-parity-check (LDPC) codeword is provided. The decoder includes a storage device configured to receive the LDPC codeword, and a check node processor configured to decode the LDPC codeword by iteratively processing layers of an LDPC code. The LDPC code is constructed by determining a protograph for the LDPC code, and constructing a base matrix for the LDPC code. The base matrix is constructed by replacing each zero in the protograph with a &#x2018;&#x2212;1&#x2019;, selecting a corresponding value for an absolute shift for each one in the protograph based on constraining a number of relative shifts per column of the LDPC code to one and increasing a size of a smallest cycle in a graph of the LDPC code, and replacing each one in the protograph with the corresponding value.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A method for constructing a low-rate low-density-parity-check (LDPC) code is provided. The method includes concatenating a number of information bits with a number of zeros to form a set of concatenated bits, encoding the concatenated bits using an encoder configured to encode LDPC codewords having a code rate that is larger than the code rate of the low-rate LDPC code to form an LDPC codeword, and replacing the zeros in the LDPC codeword with the information bits.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The different illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure recognize and take into account that resource blocks (RB) in the proposed frame structure for millimeter-wave mobile communications include <b>432</b> data modulation symbols and each subband consists of four RBs. Accordingly, the different illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure provide several LDPC codes with lengths 432 and 1728. The different illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure include several design constraints that facilitate high-throughput low-power decoder architecture.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a decoder in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure. In this illustrative example, decoder <b>400</b> is a decoder for decoding LDPC codes of various rates and lengths provided in the illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure. For example, a subscriber station or base station may transmit LDPC codewords in a wireless network. Decoder <b>400</b> receives and decodes the transmitted codeword.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Memory <b>405</b> stores channel inputs received at decoder <b>400</b>. Check-node processor <b>410</b> iteratively processes layers of the LDPC code to decode the transmitted codeword. For example, check-node processor <b>410</b> has a number of inputs for processing columns in a single row or layer of a received codeword. Shift module <b>415</b> cyclically shifts processed layer for processing of additional layers by check-node processor <b>410</b>. Once each layer has been processed, the decoded codeword is output by decoder <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In designing the LDPC codes of the present disclosure, the present disclosure includes several design constraints to facilitate high-throughput low-power decoder architecture. For example, the different illustrative embodiments recognize that utilization of the critical path in check-node processor <b>410</b> is important. The critical path is the number of processing stages that must be completed to process a single layer of LDPC code. The larger the length of the critical path the longer clock cycle period used and lower the throughput of decoder <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The critical path of check-node processor <b>410</b> is proportional to the value given in Equation 1 below.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>2<sup>ceil</sup>(log<sub>2</sub>(<i>c</i>))&#x2003;&#x2003;Equation 1.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where &#x2018;c&#x2019; is the number of the variable nodes (VNs) or columns present in the protograph of the LDPC code. As a result, choosing &#x2018;c&#x2019; as a power of two provides the best utilization of the critical bath. Accordingly, different illustrative embodiments of present provide 16 columns in the design of the LDPC codes.
</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Additionally, the present disclosure recognizes that limiting the number of layers processed by check-node processor <b>410</b> can improve the throughput and power efficiency of decoder <b>400</b>. Accordingly, different illustrative embodiments of present provide LDPC codes having a column weight of less than or equal four with the designed codes being 4-layer decodable. The column weight is the number of non &#x2018;&#x2212;1&#x2019; values present in a given column. In other words, while codes of different rates may have different numbers of rows, some rows can be processed in parallel such that the code can be decoded in four layers, hence, 4-layer decodable.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Different illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure also recognize that use of the same decoder hardware to decode LDPC codes of different rates can result in component cost and size savings. As a result, in some embodiments, shift module <b>415</b> can implement all possible shifts between the rows of the base matrices of the designed LDPC codes. Additionally, reducing the number of relative shifts per column reduces the critical path for decoder <b>400</b>. A relative shift is a shift between successive rows of a column. In decoder <b>400</b>, constraining the number of relative shifts per column simplifies the architecture of the shifting elements in shifting module <b>415</b>. For example, multiplexers created from CMOS logic or pass-transistor logic may perform the shifts in shifting module <b>415</b>. Additional, increasing the number of shifts per column performed per layer increases the number of layers of multiplexers performing the shifts. As a result, illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure constrain the number of the relative shifts between circulant blocks in the same column. In some embodiments, the relative shift per column is one.</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The illustration of decoder <b>400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is not meant to imply physical or architectural limitations to the manner in which different advantageous embodiments may be implemented. Other components in addition and/or in place of the ones illustrated may be used. Some components may be unnecessary in some embodiments. For example, one or more shifts may occur before or after decoding of the LDPC codeword.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates rate &#xbe; LDPC codes of lengths 432 and 1728 in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure. Base matrix <b>500</b> is an example of rate &#xbe; LDPC code of lengths 432 designed according to one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In this illustrative embodiment, base matrix <b>500</b> has a parallelization factor (or Z factor) of 27. The various values in base matrix <b>500</b> are cyclical shift blocks where the value present represents an absolute cyclical shift applied to a 27&#xd7;27 identity matrix. For example, a base H-matrix designed used Z-factor expansion is guaranteed to have layers (or rows) consisting of Z contention-free parity checks.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The different illustrative embodiments recognize that within each layer there is no sharing of information between parity checks. Therefore, there is a trade-off between parallelization and number of parity checks with Z-factor selection. The higher Z-factor means the code can support greater parallelization, but it constrains the code design by limiting the possibilities of the parity checks and limiting the amount of information passed between the parity checks. The lower Z-factor reduces the constraints on the parity checks but lowers the potential for parallelization. The different illustrative embodiments include LDPC code designs with a Z-factor selected to provide a reasonable amount of parallelization without overly constraining the parity checks and limiting the information shared between the layers.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Embodiments of the present disclosure also provide LDPC code designs that include parity check matrices with a lower triangular structure. As depicted, parity check matrix <b>505</b> includes absolute shift values in the lower triangle portion of the parity check matrix <b>505</b>. Designing parity check matrix <b>505</b> to include the lower triangular structure promotes faster encoding.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In accordance with illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure, base matrix <b>500</b> for 432 bit length rate-&#xbe; LDPC code with a parallelization factor of 27 may be designed by first generating a protograph based on the design constraints discussed above. The protograph has 16 columns as discussed above. For rate-&#xbe; code one fourth of the code are parity bits. As a result to promote lower triangle structure in parity matrix <b>505</b>, the photograph includes four rows. Additionally, four rows guarantees that the resulting LDPC code is at least 4-layer decodable. The protograph is designed based on an extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) analysis to achieve a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold (i.e., protograph threshold) for successful decoding.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next the protograph is lifted using one shift per column with the values for the absolute shift in the circulant blocks selected to increase a size of a smallest cycle and increase the minimum distance. A cycle is a closed loop which starts at a given node and returns to the same node in a graph (e.g., Tanner graph) of variable nodes and check nodes. The size of the cycle is the number of nodes required to traverse before returning back to the same node. Increasing the size of the smallest cycle of the LDPC code results in better error performance of the code. The smallest Hamming weight (number of non-zero bits in the codeword) of the codewords in the code is the minimum distance of the LDPC code.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Upon initial assignment of the values for the circulant blocks in base matrix <b>500</b>, the minimum distance of the code and smallest cycle size is checked. One or more values for the circulant blocks may be modified in accordance with the design constraints to improve the size of the smallest cycle and minimum distance parameters of the LDPC code. This process may be iteratively repeated to improve code design. In this illustrative embodiment, the size of the smallest cycle is six. Such a smallest cycle size may be achieved using assignments other than assignments illustrated by base matrix <b>500</b>. Base matrix <b>500</b> is one example of rate &#xbe; length 432 LDPC code designed according to the principals of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As depicted, in base matrix <b>500</b> the relative shift between the circulant blocks in any two adjacent rows is the same, if circulant blocks are present in the two rows. As an example, the relative shift between the circulant blocks in any two adjacent rows is zero in the first column. As another example, the relative shift between the circulant blocks in any two adjacent rows is one in the second column. As yet another example, the relative shift between the circulant blocks in any two adjacent rows is 25 in the eleventh column. Note that the dimension of the circulant block is 27 in this example. The circulant block for the 1st row and the 11th column is the identity matrix, as denoted by the number &#x2018;0&#x2019;. The circulant block for the 2nd row and the 11th column is the circulant block obtained by cyclically shift the identity matrix by 25 times, as denoted by the number &#x2018;25&#x2019;. The circulant block for the 3rd row and the 11th column is the circulant block obtained by cyclically shift the circulant block in the previous row by 25 times, which can be obtained equivalently by cyclically shift the identity matrix by 50 times. Since the dimension of the identity matrix and circulant blocks in this example is 27, the circulant block in the 3rd row and the 11th column can be obtained by cyclically shift the identity matrix by 50&#x2212;27=23 times, as denoted by the number &#x2018;23&#x2019;. This procedure for cyclically shifting past 27 is noted by mod(z) (i.e., 25+25 mod(z)=23).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In another example, permutation of the rows of the parity check matrix results in the same code. As an example, in base matrix <b>500</b> exchanging the order of the 1st and the 2nd rows results in the same code.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In another example, permutation of the columns of the parity check matrix results in codes with similar performance and properties. For example, exchanging the first and the second columns in base matrix <b>500</b> results in the same minimum distance, SNR threshold, and similar error performance of the code. In another example, replacing the circulant permutations {0, 0, 0, 0} in the first column by the circulant permutations {1, 1, 1, 1}, {2, 2, 2, 2}, or {26, 26, 26, 26} results in the same minimum distance, SNR threshold, and similar error performance of the code. In yet another example, replacing the circulant permutations {0, 1, 2, 3} in the second column by the circulant permutations {1, 2, 3, 4}, {2, 3, 4, 5}, or {26, 0, 1, 2} results in the same minimum distance, SNR threshold, and similar error performance of the code.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">For uses requesting multiple RBs, four RBs or one subband can be utilized by 1728-bit length LDPC code. In different illustrative embodiments, 1728-bit length LDPC code can be constructed by lifting base matrix <b>500</b> by a factor of four using lifting matrix <b>510</b>. Lifting matrix <b>510</b> includes values for circulant shifts of the values in the circulant blocks in base matrix <b>510</b>. For example, matrix <b>515</b> illustrates circulant block <b>520</b> lifted by a factor of four and cyclically shifted twice as shown by block <b>525</b>. In matrix <b>515</b>, the value from circulant block <b>520</b> &#x2018;21&#x2019; is lifted by a factor of four by multiplying the identity matrix for 4&#xd7;4 by 21. The values in matrix <b>515</b> are then cyclically shifted twice to the right according to block <b>525</b> resulting in the values displayed in matrix <b>515</b>. A similar procedure can be applied to each block in base matrix <b>500</b> to result in length-1728 LDPC code. Additionally, once constructed, the smallest cycle size and minimum distance in the length-1728 LDPC code can be checked for compliance with design constraints. One or more values in lifting matrix <b>510</b> may be adjusted to reduce the number of cycles at the smallest and increase the minimum distance of the length-1728 LDPC code.</p>

The protograph for the rate- 13/16 LDPC code has 3 rows and 16 columns and is designed using a protograph-based EXIT analysis which satisfies the design constraints discussed above and achieves a low SNR threshold. The three rows insure that the resultant code is decodable in at most three layers.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The protograph is lifted using the same relative shifts used in the rate-&#xbe; LDPC code of base matrix <b>500</b>.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Given the lower code rate, base matrix <b>700</b> includes more rows than base matrices <b>500</b> and <b>600</b>.

For example, the second and the fifth rows in base matrix <b>700</b> are contention free and can be decoded in parallel. Also, the third and the sixth rows can be decoded in parallel. Thus, a codeword encoded according to base matrix <b>700</b> this code can be decoded in four layers. In the first layer, check-node processor <b>410</b> can process the first row.

<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a process for constructing rate &#xbc; LDPC code in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure. In this illustrative embodiment, rate-&#xbc; linear block code (e.g., LDPC code) can be derived from the rate-&#xbd; linear block code. First information (input data) bits <b>1100</b>, which are equal to one fourth of the code length, are concatenated with an equal number of zeros <b>1105</b>. The concatenated bits are encoded using a systematic rate-&#xbd; linear block code encoder. For example, a same encoder used to encode the rate-&#xbd; code described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A&#x26;B</figref>. Then in output codeword <b>1110</b> zeros <b>1105</b> are replaced with information bits <b>1100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">For example, a &#xbc; rate 432-bit length code can be encoded as discussed above with 108 information bits copied to 108 zeros. In another example, a &#xbc; rate 1728-bit length code can be encoded as discussed above with 432 information bits copied to 432 zeros.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a process for constructing rate &#x215b; LDPC code in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure. In this illustrative embodiment, rate-&#x215b; linear block code (e.g., LDPC code) can be derived from the rate-&#xbd; linear block code. First information (input data) bits <b>1200</b>, which are equal to one eighth of the code length, are concatenated with number of zeros <b>1205</b> equals to three eighth of the code. The concatenated bits are encoded using a systematic rate-&#xbd; linear block code encoder. For example, a same encoder used to encode the rate-&#xbd; code described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A&#x26;B</figref>. Then in output codeword <b>1210</b> zeros <b>1205</b> are replaced with three copies of the information bits <b>1200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">For example, a &#x215b; rate 432-bit length code can be encoded as discussed above with 54 information bits copied three times to 162 zeros. In another example, a &#x215b; rate 1728-bit length code can be encoded as discussed above with 216 information bits copied three times to 648 zeros.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates a process for constructing rate 3/16 LDPC code in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure. In this illustrative embodiment, rate- 3/16 linear block code (e.g., LDPC code) can be derived from the rate-&#x215c; linear block code. First information (input data) bits <b>1300</b>, which are three sixteenths the code length, are concatenated with an equal number of zeros <b>1305</b>. The concatenated bits are encoded using a systematic rate-&#x215c; linear block code encoder. For example, a same encoder used to encode the rate-&#x215c; code described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A&#x26;B</figref>. Then in output codeword <b>1310</b> zeros <b>1305</b> are replaced with information bits <b>1300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">For example, a 3/16 rate 432-bit length code can be encoded as discussed above with 81 information bits copied to 81 zeros. In another example, a 3/16 rate 1728-bit length code can be encoded as discussed above with 648 information bits copied to 648 zeros.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In other illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure, rates &#xbc;, &#x215b;, and 3/16 code can be derived using additional methods. For example, one can interleave the information bits in the copied positions. In another example, one can scramble the information bits in the copied position. In other examples, one can partially/fully negate or interleave and partially/fully negate the information bits in the copied positions based on an a priori known pattern. In yet other examples, one can concatenate the original information data with any a priori known pattern of &#x2018;1&#x2019;s and &#x2018;0&#x2019;s prior to encoding and then to replace the pattern with any of the methods above.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In yet other illustrative embodiments, one can duplicate the original information bits based on the rate (2&#xd7; for rate &#xbc;, 4&#xd7; for rate &#x215b;, etc.) prior to encoding. The duplication padding can be done with any of the methods above.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Additionally, different illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure decode the low-rates codes described above. For example, upon the receiving a codeword encoded using the rate-&#xbc;, rate- 3/16, or rate-&#x215b; codes described above (which consists of soft information bits, soft repeated information bits, and soft parity bits), decoder <b>400</b> can decode the received codeword. For example, decoder <b>400</b> may add the values of the soft information bits to their corresponding values of the soft repeated information bits. Then, decoder <b>400</b> may replace the repeated information bits with strong soft zero-bits (e.g., large positive number &#x201c;+inf&#x201d;). Then, decode the codeword formed by the addition of the soft information bits and soft repeated information bits.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a process for constructing a family of LDPC codes in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure. The process may be performed by an encoder such as for example channel coding and modulation block <b>205</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The process begins by identifying a code rate for an TDPC code (block <b>1405</b>). In block <b>1405</b>, the code rates of the family of codes may include rate-&#x215c; code, rate-&#xbd; code, rate-&#x215d; code, rate-&#xbe; code, and rate- 13/16 code.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The process then identifies a protograph for the LDPC code (block <b>1410</b>). In block <b>1410</b>, the process may identify the protograph by calculating a number of variable nodes for the protograph based on utilization of a critical path of check nodes in the protograph and setting a column weight of less than or equal to four for each code rate in the family of LDPC codes such that LDPC codewords encoded using the family of LDPC codes are decodable in less than or equal to four layers. Additionally, the protograph may be constructed using an EXIT analysis to achieve a lowest SNR threshold possible. Thereafter, the process replaces each zero in the protograph with a &#x2018;&#x2212;1&#x2019; (block <b>1415</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The process then constrains a number of relative shifts per column (block <b>1420</b>). In block <b>1420</b>, the number of relative shifts may be constrained to one.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Thereafter, the process selects a corresponding value for an absolute shift for each one (block <b>1425</b>). In block <b>1425</b>, the values may be selected to maintain the single relative shift while reducing a size of a smallest cycle and increasing a minimum distance of the LDPC code. The process then replaces each one in the protograph with the corresponding value (block <b>1430</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Thereafter, the process determines whether a size of a smallest cycle can be increased (block <b>1435</b>). If the size of the smallest cycle can be increased, the process returns to block <b>1425</b> and selects one or more new values for one or more ones in the protograph. If the size of the smallest cycle cannot be increased, the process terminates with the LDPC code for the identified code rate constructed.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates a process for constructing a low-rate LDPC code in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure. The process may be performed by an encoder such as for example channel coding and modulation block <b>205</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The process begins by concatenating a number of information bits with a number of zeros (block <b>1505</b>). In block <b>1505</b>, the low-rate code is constructed from higher-rate code. The process then encodes the concatenated bits (block <b>1510</b>). In block <b>1510</b>, the bits may be encoded using a same encoder as used to encode the higher-rate code. Thereafter, the process replaces the zeros with the information bits (block <b>1515</b>), with the process terminating thereafter. In block <b>1515</b>, the encoded code word includes additional redundant information beyond the parity bits. When decoded, the additional redundant can be added to the original information to increase a power of the original information without increasing the transmit power used to transmit the encoded codeword. Additionally, the low-rate code may have similar coding performance of higher-rate codes; thus, increasing perceived transmit power without sacrificing significant change in performance.</p>
