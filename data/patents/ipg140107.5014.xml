<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Mobile devices currently require manual changes to configuration settings so as to fit the user's situation. For example, when entering a meeting or performance hall, a user typically needs to silence their mobile device alerts to avoid interrupting the event. Users frequently forget to do so. This often leads to the disruption and annoyance of other attendees and embarrassment to the user.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OVERVIEW OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">This description provides examples not intended to limit the scope of the appended claims. The figures generally indicate the features of the examples, where it is to be understood and appreciated that like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Disclosed herein in an example embodiment is an application layer communications protocol configured to broadcast situational awareness cues to a mobile device (MD). The Mobile Device Situational Awareness Protocol (MDSAP) can operate over any wireless protocol, including existing wireless radio protocols such as Bluetooth&#x2122;, 802.11 (a, b, g, or n), GSM, TDMA, etc., which are commonly found in consumer mobile devices including mobile phones, personal digital assistants, and laptop computers.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In addition to the MDs themselves, which act as clients in the protocol exchange, one or more Situational Awareness Server Appliances are employed. These may be dedicated infrastructure nodes and/or MDs. For example, in ad hoc wireless networks with no Situational Awareness Server Appliance (&#x201c;SASA&#x201d;) available at the physical location, one MD may be designated as the SASA.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Upon entering radio communication range with a SASA, an MD would receive configuration settings from the SASA tailored to the situation. For example, an SASA in a conference room would notify MDs in the room to change alerts to the &#x201c;meeting&#x201d; or &#x201c;silent&#x201d; setting. Likewise, auditoriums or other performance venues may also use an SASA to provide alerts to an MD to use appropriate settings for the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">MDSAP-aware software on the MDs would allow users to configure their devices to accept configuration information from SASAs automatically, to accept configuration information after prompting the user, or reject configuration information from SASAs and maintain their current settings. Granular controls can be implemented so that users can define the device behavior profiles for SASA settings like &#x201c;meeting,&#x201d; &#x201c;concert,&#x201d; &#x201c;car,&#x201d; and so on as they see fit. SASA administrators can configure the SASA devices to broadcast the appropriate MD setting information for their venue.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As part of the interaction between mobile device (MD) and situational awareness server appliance (SASA), the MD may notify the SASA as to whether the MD successfully entered the desired operational mode (e.g. changed to &#x201c;silent&#x201d; or &#x201c;no RF transmission&#x201d; mode). This would enable the SASA to monitor compliance with the MD configuration policies of the venue. For example, in an airplane setting, the SASA could alert the flight crew that some users rejected the configuration change recommended by the SASA when the cabin door was closed, choosing to leave the voice features of their phones enabled. Similarly, a movie theater might have a SASA that asks MDs to disable video recording features and could alert staff if users reject that configuration change.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition to MD configuration setting information, the SASA devices could distribute location-specific and event-specific information to MDs. For example, SASAs could provide location-specific information, including maps of the building with the locations of food vendors, restrooms, emergency exits, fire extinguishers, etc. SASAs could also provide event-specific information to MDs, such as copies of presentations, event-specific advertising, or marketing materials, etc. As with the MD configuration settings received from SASA devices, end users could configure their MDs to automatically accept, accept after prompting, or reject SASA location-specific information. The MDSAP can reduce event disruptions without requiring user intervention and/or without requiring forceful techniques, such as radio jamming, that effectively disable a mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an example embodiment, a mobile device can be integrated with a calendar. This can enable the mobile device to change modes based on scheduled events such as meetings automatically, even if the mobile device cannot communicate with a SASA. For example, if a meeting was scheduled for 3:00 p.m., a mobile telephone could automatically enter a &#x201c;meeting&#x201d; mode at 3:00 p.m., even if no signal was received from a situation awareness server.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A mobile device can be any device that uses wireless communication to communicate with a network such as a laptop computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), and/or mobile telephone.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example apparatus <b>100</b> configured in accordance with an example embodiment. Apparatus <b>100</b> is suitably adapted for implementing a mobile device that is capable of implementing a mobile device situational protocol, as described herein. Apparatus <b>100</b> comprises a wireless transceiver <b>102</b>, which is configured to receive a wireless signal. Control logic <b>104</b> is in communication with wireless transceiver <b>102</b>. &#x201c;Logic,&#x201d; as used herein, includes but is not limited to hardware, firmware, software and/or combinations of each used to perform a function(s) or an action(s) and/or to cause a function or action from another component. For example, based on a desired application or need, logic may include a software-controlled microprocessor; discrete logic such as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a programmable/programmed logic device, memory device containing instructions, or the like; or combinational logic embodied in hardware. Logic may also be fully embodied as software.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Device configuration <b>106</b> comprises configuration parameters for apparatus <b>100</b>. Device configuration <b>106</b> is in communication with control logic <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an example embodiment, control logic <b>104</b> receives situational data via wireless transceiver <b>102</b>. For example, the situational data may be sent in a unicast, multicast, and/or broadcast message. As another example, situational data may be sent in beacons. Control logic <b>104</b> is configured to change a configurable setting in response to the signal containing data representative of a current situation.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an example embodiment, apparatus <b>100</b> further comprises an audio output device (not shown, see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The situational data can contain data indicating that audio output from the device should be muted. For example, this situational data may be sent from a meeting room while a meeting is in progress; a concert hall, theatre, library, or any other type of public performance venue; religious areas; and/or any area where audio output (such as cell phone ringing, pager audio alerts, or computer system boot up signature screens) is not desired. In some embodiments, control logic <b>104</b> can switch from an audio output, such as a ringer, to vibrate mode.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an example embodiment, wireless transceiver <b>102</b> comprises a wireless transceiver and a wireless receiver (not shown). Control logic <b>104</b> is responsive to switch off the transmitter in response to receiving the data. In particular embodiments, control logic <b>104</b> is further configured to switch off the receiver as well. For example, while on an airplane or in a hospital, use of a wireless device such as a laptop computer or PDA may be allowed; however, use of the wireless transceiver may be prohibited. Control logic <b>104</b>, upon receiving a signal with situational data indicating that use of the wireless receiver and/or transmitter is prohibited, is responsive to turn off the receiver and/or transmitter.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an example embodiment, control logic <b>104</b> may change the operating mode of wireless transceiver <b>102</b>. For example, situational data may indicate that cellular communications are prohibited but that Bluetooth&#x2122; and/or Wifi communications are acceptable. In this example, control logic <b>104</b> would configure wireless transceiver <b>102</b> to operate either in a Bluetooth&#x2122; and/or Wifi compatible mode.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an example embodiment, control logic <b>104</b> automatically changes the configuration setting in response to receiving the situational data. In another example embodiment, apparatus <b>100</b> further comprises a user interface (not shown, see e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Control logic <b>104</b> is configured to provide an output on the user interface requesting confirmation that the configurable setting should be changed. Control logic <b>104</b> is configured to change the configurable setting responsive to receiving data, via the user interface, confirming the change. In an example embodiment, control logic <b>104</b> is configured to send data via wireless transceiver <b>102</b> indicating whether the configuration setting was changed. This message may be limited to situations where the change in the configurable setting was not accepted or may also include messages to confirm that the change was accepted.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an example embodiment, control logic <b>104</b> receives situational data that is representative of a scheduled event. This data may be stored in a calendar module that is part of control logic <b>104</b> or may be received via wireless transceiver <b>102</b>. For example, upon entering a meeting room, control logic <b>104</b> may continue normal operation until wireless transceiver <b>102</b> receives situational data indicating the meeting has started.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an example embodiment, apparatus <b>100</b> further comprises an audio output device (not shown, see e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and a video output device (not shown, see e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) that are in communication with control logic <b>104</b>. Control logic <b>104</b> can be configured to switch off the audio output device in response to receiving situational data indicating audio output should be muted. Wireless transceiver <b>102</b> may further be configured to receive event-specific data that control logic <b>104</b> has displayed on the video output device. For example, while a meeting is in progress, the audio output can be muted, while event-specific data such as presentation data, marketing data, advertising data, etc. can be received via wireless interface <b>102</b> and displayed on the video output device.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an example embodiment, wireless transceiver <b>102</b> further comprises a transmitter and a receiver. Control logic <b>104</b> is configured to enable the transmitter and receiver to operate responsive to receiving the data indicating a location is in a first situation but switches off the transmitter and/or receiver responsive to receiving situational data indicating the first location is in a second situation. For example, when boarding an airplane, cellular telephones are allowed to be used while the cabin door is open. Transceiver <b>102</b> can receive data indicating that apparatus <b>100</b> is on an airplane, but operations are permitted. When the cabin door is closed, another signal is received comprising data indicating that cellular telephone communications are prohibited. Control logic <b>104</b> switches off the transmitter and/or receiver responsive to receiving the data indicating that cellular telephone communications are prohibited. As another example, when arriving in a meeting room, audio signals from computing devices such as cell phones, pagers, PDAs, and/or laptops may be permitted. Once the meeting begins, a signal comprising data indicating that the meeting has begun is received via wireless transceiver <b>102</b>. Control logic <b>104</b> can mute the audio output in response to receiving the signal comprising data indicating that the meeting has begun.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In an example, embodiment, apparatus <b>100</b> performs the functionality of a Situational Awareness Server Appliance (SASA) as described herein. In this embodiment, control logic <b>104</b> sends situational data via wireless transceiver <b>102</b>. For example, control logic <b>104</b> can send data via wireless transceiver <b>102</b> indicating when mobile devices should mute their audio output, turn off receivers and/or transmitters, and/or turn off. In an example embodiment, apparatus <b>100</b> is a mobile device, which may receive situational data via wireless transceiver <b>102</b> and control logic <b>104</b> can then re-transmit the situational data via wireless transceiver <b>102</b>. In another example embodiment, apparatus <b>100</b> can be implemented in an infrastructure node, such as an access point. The situational data may be sent in any type of transmission, including but not limited to probe responses; beacons; and unicast, multicast, and/or broadcast messages.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an example embodiment, in addition to sending situational data, control logic <b>104</b> is configured to send event-specific data via wireless transceiver <b>102</b> associated with the current situation. For example, if an emergency condition is encountered, the event-specific data may be map data, data indicating a nearest emergency exit, data indicating a nearest fire extinguisher, and data indicating a nearest location of predetermined equipment (such as a defibrillator, oxygen, etc.). As another example, if the area is a meeting room, the situational data may instruct mobile devices to turn off audio output devices, and the event-specific data can be presentation data, event-specific advertising and/or event-specific marketing materials. For example, while a meeting presenter is speaking, a PowerPoint presentation can be pushed out to the mobile devices.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an example embodiment, apparatus <b>100</b> further comprises an output device (not shown, see e.g., output device <b>218</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Wireless transceiver <b>102</b> may receive data from a mobile device indicating whether the mobile device performed a configuration change corresponding to the situational data. If a mobile device did not change configuration, data and/or an alarm may be output to indicate the configuration was not changed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a detailed example of a wireless device <b>200</b> configured in accordance with an example embodiment. Wireless device <b>200</b> comprises a wireless transceiver <b>202</b> in communication with control logic <b>204</b>. Wireless transceiver <b>202</b> comprises a transmitter (TX) <b>220</b> and a receiver (RX) <b>222</b>. Control logic <b>204</b> comprises configuration data including normal mode (normal operating configuration) <b>206</b>, silent mode (audio output muted) <b>208</b>, no RF mode (shut off transmitter <b>220</b> and/or receiver <b>222</b>) <b>210</b>, power off module <b>212</b> (shut device off), and a scheduler module <b>214</b>. Apparatus <b>200</b> further comprises an input device <b>216</b> configured to receive user input data. Input device <b>216</b> may suitably comprise a keypad, voice activation logic, touch screen, and/or any other suitable means for receiving data from a user. Output device <b>218</b> provides output to a user. Output device <b>218</b> may suitably comprise an audio output, video output, motional output (e.g. vibration), and/or any other suitable means for providing data to a user. Input device <b>216</b> and output device <b>218</b> may suitably comprise a user interface.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an example embodiment, control logic <b>204</b> receives situational data via receiver <b>222</b> in wireless transceiver <b>202</b>. For example, the situational data may be sent in a unicast, multicast, and/or broadcast message. As another example, situational data may be sent in beacons. Control logic <b>204</b> is configured to change a configurable setting in response to the signal containing data representative of a current situation.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In an example embodiment, situational data is received via receiver <b>222</b> and communicated to control logic <b>204</b>. In addition, or in the alternative, control logic <b>204</b> may receive situational data from a calendar module (scheduler) <b>214</b>. For example, the situational data can contain data indicating that audio output from output device <b>218</b> should be muted. This may be received by a wireless signal via receiver <b>222</b>, or scheduler <b>214</b> may communicate to control logic <b>204</b> that an event (e.g. a meeting) is scheduled. For example, this may be sent from a meeting room while a meeting is in progress; a concert hall, theatre, or any other type of public performance venue; religious areas; and/or any area where audio output (such as cell phone ringing, pager audio alerts or computer system bootup signature screens) is not desired. In some embodiments, control logic <b>204</b> can switch output device <b>218</b> from an audio output, such as a ringer, to vibrate mode.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an example embodiment, control logic <b>204</b> is configured to switch off transmitter <b>220</b> in response to receiving situational data indicating transmitters should not be used (e.g. No RF mode <b>210</b>). In particular embodiments, control logic <b>204</b> is further configured to switch off the receiver <b>222</b> as well. For example, while on an airplane or in a hospital, use of a wireless device such as a laptop computer or PDA may be allowed; however, use of the wireless transceiver <b>202</b> may be prohibited. Control logic <b>204</b>, upon receiving a signal with situational data indicating that use of the wireless receiver <b>222</b> and/or transmitter <b>220</b> is prohibited, is responsive to turn off the receiver <b>222</b> and/or transmitter <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an example embodiment, control logic <b>204</b> automatically changes the configuration setting in response to receiving situational data. In another example embodiment, apparatus <b>200</b> further provides an output on output device <b>218</b> indicating that situation data and requests confirmation that the configurable setting should be changed. Control logic <b>204</b> is configured to change the configurable setting responsive to receiving data via input device <b>216</b> confirming the change.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an example embodiment, control logic <b>204</b> receives situational data representative of a scheduled event from scheduler <b>214</b>. In another example embodiment, scheduling data is received via receiver <b>222</b>. For example, upon entering a meeting room, control logic <b>104</b> may continue normal operation until wireless transceiver <b>102</b> receives situational data indicating the meeting has started. In an example embodiment, output device <b>218</b> comprises an audio output and a video output. Control logic <b>204</b> can be configured to switch off the audio output device in response to receiving situational data indicating audio output should be muted. Wireless transceiver <b>202</b> may be further configured to receive event-specific data that control logic <b>204</b> forwards for display on the video output device. For example, while a meeting is in progress, the audio output can be muted while event-specific data, such as presentation data, marketing data, advertising data, etc., can be received via wireless interface <b>202</b> and displayed on the video output device.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an example embodiment, Control logic <b>204</b> is configured to enable the transmitter <b>220</b> and receiver <b>222</b> to operate responsive the data indicating a location is in a first situation, but switches off transmitter <b>220</b> and/or receiver <b>222</b> responsive to receiving situational data indicating the first location is in a second situation. For example, when boarding an airplane, cellular telephones are allowed to be used while the cabin door is open. Transceiver <b>202</b>/receiver <b>222</b> can receive data indicating that apparatus <b>200</b> is on an airplane but operations are permitted. When the cabin door is closed, another signal is received comprising data indicating that cellular telephone communications are prohibited. Control logic <b>204</b> switches the transmitter <b>220</b> and/or receiver <b>222</b> off responsive to receiving the data indicating that cellular telephone communications are prohibited. As another example, when arriving in a meeting room, audio signals from computing devices such as cell phones, pagers, PDAs, and/or laptops may be permitted. Once the meeting begins, a signal comprising data indicating that the meeting has begun is received via wireless transceiver <b>202</b>/receiver <b>222</b>. Control logic <b>204</b> can mute the audio output in response to receiving the signal comprising data indicating that the meeting has begun.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates example implementations of example embodiments. In the illustrated example, there are three access points (APs) <b>312</b>, <b>322</b>, <b>332</b> providing service to corresponding areas <b>314</b>, <b>324</b>, <b>334</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">AP <b>312</b> is located in a meeting room. AP <b>312</b> communicates wirelessly with wireless device <b>316</b>. AP <b>312</b> sends situational data to wireless device <b>316</b> indicating that area <b>314</b> is a meeting room. Wireless device <b>316</b>, in response to the situational data, may mute its audio output. AP <b>312</b> may also send event-specific data, such as presentation data, which wireless device <b>316</b> may display on a video output.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As another example, if wireless device <b>316</b> is a cellular telephone, upon receiving situational data from AP <b>312</b> wireless device <b>316</b> may switch to a &#x2018;silent&#x2019; mode. While in silent mode, if an incoming call is received, the data may be displayed on a video output and/or wireless device <b>316</b> may vibrate.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an example embodiment, AP <b>322</b> is in a public performance venue, such as a concert hall. AP <b>322</b> sends situational data to wireless device <b>326</b>, requesting wireless device <b>326</b> operate in a quiet mode. Wireless device <b>326</b> may automatically switch to a quiet mode or may display a prompt on a user interface asking the user associated with wireless device <b>326</b> to confirm the switch into quiet mode. While in quiet mode, audio output may be suppressed, as in meeting mode. In addition, the device may also be inhibited from transmitting. For example, if wireless device <b>326</b> is a cell phone, when a call is received by wireless device <b>326</b>, the call data may be displayed on a visual display, but the phone may be inoperable (for example, the user cannot answer the phone) until the user has moved out of area <b>324</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As another example, area <b>334</b> is a hospital or medical area. When wireless device <b>336</b> receives situational data from AP <b>332</b> indicating to wireless device <b>336</b> that it is in a hospital, wireless device <b>336</b> may disable its transmitter and/or receiver. In particular embodiments, wireless device <b>336</b> may power itself off responsive to receiving signals from AP <b>332</b> and determining it is in area <b>334</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">These are but a few examples of the capabilities of the example embodiments described herein. These examples are by no means exhaustive. Those skilled in the art should readily appreciate that principles of the example embodiments illustrated herein are capable of implementing configuration changes on any type of mobile device where it is desirable to change the configuration in response to a current situation and/or environment.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram that illustrates a computer system <b>400</b> upon which an example embodiment may be implemented. Computer system <b>400</b> includes a bus <b>402</b> or other communication mechanism for communicating information and a processor <b>404</b> coupled with bus <b>402</b> for processing information. Computer system <b>400</b> also includes a main memory <b>406</b>, such as random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device coupled to bus <b>402</b> for storing information and instructions to be executed by processor <b>404</b>. Main memory <b>406</b> also may be used for storing temporary variable or other intermediate information during execution of instructions to be executed by processor <b>404</b>. Computer system <b>400</b> further includes a read only memory (ROM) <b>408</b> or other static storage device coupled to bus <b>402</b> for storing static information and instructions for processor <b>404</b>. A storage device <b>410</b>, such as a magnetic disk or optical disk, is provided and coupled to bus <b>402</b> for storing information and instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Computer system <b>400</b> may be coupled via bus <b>402</b> to a display <b>412</b>, such as a cathode ray tube (CRT) or liquid crystal display (LCD), for displaying information to a computer user. An input device <b>414</b>, such as a keyboard including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to bus <b>402</b> for communicating information and command selections to processor <b>404</b>. Another type of user input device is cursor control <b>416</b>, such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys, for communicating direction information and command selections to processor <b>404</b> and for controlling cursor movement on display <b>412</b>. This input device typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g. x) and a second axis (e.g. y), that allows the device to specify positions in a plane.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">An aspect of the example embodiment is related to the use of computer system <b>400</b> for implementing a mobile device situational awareness protocol. According to an example embodiment, the implementation of a mobile device situational awareness protocol is provided by computer system <b>400</b> in response to processor <b>404</b> executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in main memory <b>406</b>. Such instructions may be read into main memory <b>406</b> from another computer-readable medium, such as storage device <b>410</b>. Execution of the sequence of instructions contained in main memory <b>406</b> causes processor <b>404</b> to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the sequences of instructions contained in main memory <b>406</b>. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement an example embodiment. Thus, embodiments described herein are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The term &#x201c;computer-readable medium&#x201d; as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor <b>404</b> for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device <b>410</b>. Volatile media include dynamic memory such as main memory <b>406</b>. Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire, and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus <b>402</b>. Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, floppy disk, flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, an EPROM, a FLASHPROM, CD, DVD or any other memory chip or cartridge, or any other medium from which a computer can read.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Various forms of computer-readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor <b>404</b> for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer system <b>400</b> can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal. An infrared detector coupled to bus <b>402</b> can receive the data carried in the infrared signal and place the data on bus <b>402</b>. Bus <b>402</b> carries the data to main memory <b>406</b>, from which processor <b>404</b> retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory <b>406</b> optionally may be stored on storage device <b>410</b> either before or after execution by processor <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Computer system <b>400</b> also includes a communication interface <b>418</b> coupled to bus <b>402</b>. Communication interface <b>418</b> provides a two-way data communication coupling computer system <b>400</b> to a network link <b>420</b> that is connected to a local network <b>422</b>. In an example embodiment, communication interface <b>418</b> is a wireless communication interface and network link <b>420</b> is a wireless link.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Network link <b>420</b> typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, network link <b>420</b> may provide a connection through local network <b>422</b> to a host computer <b>424</b> or to data equipment operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) <b>426</b>. ISP <b>426</b>, in turn, provides data communications through the worldwide packet data communication network, now commonly referred to as the &#x201c;Internet&#x201d; <b>428</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Computer system <b>400</b> can send messages and receive data, including program codes, through the network(s), network link <b>420</b>, and communication interface <b>418</b>. In the Internet example, a server <b>430</b> might transmit a requested code for an application program through Internet <b>428</b>, ISP <b>426</b>, local network <b>422</b>, and communication interface <b>418</b>. In accordance with an example embodiment, one such downloaded application provides for implementing a mobile device situational awareness protocol as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In view of the foregoing structural and functional features described above, methodologies in accordance with example embodiments will be better appreciated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref> are shown and described as executing serially, it is to be understood and appreciated that the example embodiments are not limited by the illustrated order, as some aspects could occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other aspects from that shown and described herein. Moreover, not all illustrated features may be required to implement an example embodiment. The methodologies described herein are suitably adapted to be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example methodology <b>500</b> for configuring a mobile device in response to receiving situational data. At <b>502</b>, a mobile device receives situational data via a wireless transceiver. For example, the situational data may be sent in a unicast, multicast, and/or broadcast message. As another example, situational data may be sent in beacons.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">For example, the situational data can contain data indicating that audio output from the device should be muted. As another example, the situational data may indicate that the mobile device is in an area where transmitters and/or receivers should not be operating.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">At <b>504</b>, an appropriate configuration corresponding to the situational data is determined. For example, the situational data may contain configuration data for the situation, and/or the mobile device may have pre-stored configurations. For example, situation data may indicate that the mobile device is in a meeting room; a concert hall, theatre, or any other type of public performance venue; religious areas; and/or any area where audio output (such as cell phone ringing, pager audio alerts, or computer system boot up signature screens) is not desired. For example, the mobile device may determine that it is inside a hospital and transmitters and/or receivers should not be operating.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">At <b>506</b>, the mobile device changes its configuration in accordance with the situational data. For example, audio outputs may be muted, transmitters may be turned off, or other configuration changes appropriate for the current situation may be implemented. As another example, a device, such as apparatus <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), can determine the appropriate configuration from stored configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an example methodology <b>600</b> for configuring a mobile device in response to scheduled events. At <b>602</b> an event is scheduled. For example, a user may schedule a meeting for a certain time and place. At <b>604</b>, an operating mode is selected for the event. For example, for a meeting, audio output may be muted, but vibration and video output may be allowed. At <b>606</b>, the device waits for the time of the event. At <b>608</b>, the mobile device is configured accordingly. In an example embodiment, the mobile device may determine it is not at the appropriate location for the event and provide a warning. In an example embodiment, the mobile device does not change configuration until it has determined that it is at the appropriate location for the scheduled event. In yet another example embodiment, the mobile device changes its configuration based on the time of the event and does not not determine whether the mobile device is at the appropriate location. In still another example embodiment, the mobile device presents the user with a display indicating that it is about to change configuration and waits for user input confirming the change before actually changing configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an example methodology <b>700</b> for providing situational data and event-specific data. Methodology <b>700</b> could be implemented by an SASA. At <b>702</b>, the current situation is determined; for example, if on an airplane, whether the cabin door is opened or closed. The situation may be the current location; for example, when in a certain area a mobile device should change to a pre-defined configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">At <b>704</b>, situational data is sent indicating the current situation. The data may be sent as part of a beacon and/or in unicast, multicast, and/or broadcast messages. The situational data may indicate a desired configuration, such as mute audio outputs, turn off transmitters, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">At <b>706</b>, event-specific data is sent. The event-specific data may be information that is to be displayed to a user of a mobile device, providing additional and/or useful data to the user. For example, the event-specific data may be map data, data indicating a nearest emergency exit, data indicating a nearest fire extinguisher, and data indicating a nearest location of predetermined equipment, etc. responsive to an emergency situation such as a fire. As another example, for a meeting, event-specific data can be presentation data, event-specific advertising, and/or event-specific marketing materials.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Described above are example embodiments. It is, of course, not possible to describe every conceivable combination of components or methodologies, but one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many further combinations and permutations of the example embodiments are possible.
