<heading id="h-0002" level="1">2. FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to band gap devices for converting photon energy into a voltage or current, or for converting a current into photon energy, over a broad wavelength spectrum, and more particularly to multiple band gap devices comprising nanohole superlattices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">3. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Photoelectric device efficiency depends on many factors, both extrinsic and intrinsic. Of the two classes, intrinsic factors set a limit on the maximum efficiency that a photoelectric device can achieve. Dominant intrinsic factors include losses due to (i) lack of absorption of photons, (ii) exciton relaxation and (iii) radiative recombination. The first loss results from the failure of a semiconductor to absorb photons with energy less than the energy band gap of the semiconductor. The second loss takes place when photons with energy greater than the energy band gap of the semiconductor generates electrons and holes which immediately lose to heat almost all energy in excess of the energy band gap of the semiconductor. And the third loss is due to the recombination of electron-hole pairs generating light.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Reducing these intrinsic losses is a goal in photoelectric device development, particularly for devices used over a broad spectrum of wavelengths. For instance, solar radiation ranges from 100 nm to 14 &#x3bc;m, with the visible light ranging from 400 nm to 700 nm. Assuming all extrinsic losses are eliminated, the maximum efficiency is about 31 percent for an ideal solar cell made from a single semiconducting material with an optimal band gap of about 1.35 eV (See, Journal of Applied Physics 51, 4494 (1980)). That is, 69 percent of solar energy is not cultivated due to the intrinsic losses.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One strategy for improving device efficiency is to use multijunction photoelectric devices having materials with multiple band gaps. Some existing multijunction photovoltaic devices are built from group III-V semiconductors (See, Energy and Environmental Science, 2, 174-192 (2009)). A typical structure of a multijunction photovoltaic device comprises a number of n-p (or p-n) junctions made from different semiconducting materials stacked on top of each other. Each junction has an energy band gap higher than the junction below it; and an interface is disposed in between the stacked junctions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a generalized three junction structure of a series-connected, monolithically-grown, GaInP/GaInAs/Ge stack (See, U.S. Pat. No. 6,660,928 to M. O. Patton).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Several issues need to be addressed in order to fabricate a multiple band gap device, such as a three junction photovoltaic device depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. First, semiconducting materials for different layers typically need to have a matched lattice constant in order to epitaxially grow on a substrate and to form p-n or n-p junctions. Second, to facilitate improved efficiency, the interfaces between two n-p (or p-n) junction layers typically need to have a low resistance to enable the generated current to flow from one junction to the next. Accordingly, in a monolithic structure, low resistive tunnel junctions have been used to minimize the blockage of current flow. Third, current density generated in each layer typically needs to be roughly the same so that the lowest photogenerated current density does not limit the current flowing through the multijunction device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Such requirements impose technical challenges in the fabrication of semiconducting materials and multijunction devices. It is difficult to construct three different semiconducting materials having desired band gaps, and at the same time, meeting other design goals such as a matched lattice constant. For example, the three junctions in the GaInP/GaAs/Ge system are limited to the respective band gaps of 1.8, 1.4, and 0.67 eV, respectively (See, Energy and Environmental Science 2, 174-192 (2009)). This leads to a non-ideal combination of band gaps, and consequently lower device efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Efforts have been directed to modifying the composition of semiconducting materials by adjusting band gaps and balancing the current. Examples can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,340,788 to R. R. King et al., which discloses several three junction cells including (i) Ga<sub>0.52</sub>In<sub>0.48 </sub>P, GaAs, and Si<sub>0.17</sub>Ge<sub>0.83 </sub>devices with respective band gaps of 1.89, 1.42, and 0.92 eV, (ii) Ga<sub>0.55</sub>In<sub>0.45</sub>P, GaP<sub>0.07</sub>As<sub>0.93 </sub>and Si devices with respective band gaps of 1.94, 1.51, and 1.12 eV, (iii) Ga<sub>0.52</sub>In<sub>0.48</sub>P, GaAs and Si devices with respective band gaps of 1.89, 1.42, and 1.12 eV, and (iv) Ga<sub>0.52</sub>In<sub>0.48</sub>P, Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>P<sub>y</sub>As<sub>1-y</sub>, and Si devices with respective band gaps of 1.89, 1.50 and 1.12 eV.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Meanwhile, efforts have been directed to employing more p-n (or n-p) layers to improve the efficiency. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,340,788 to et al., discloses a number of four-junction solar cells while U.S. Pat. No. 6,316,715 to King et al. discloses solar cells having three, four or five-junctions.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Although modification of the composition of semiconducting materials may improve device efficiency, maximum efficiencies have not yet been achieved to date because of practical obstacles in building such devices. Such obstacles include facilitating epitaxial growth of desired compositions due to miscibility gap of multiple layers on top of each other while satisfying interlayer lattice matching constraints and the need to balance the amount of current generated in each junction in the multijunction stack. That is, composition tuning, lattice constant matching, and current balancing complicate the multijunction fabrication process and increase the cost of production of such devices.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Given the above background, there is a need in the art for improved devices that are easier to fabricate and/or have improved efficiency or other improved characteristics.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">4. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Disclosed herein are multiple band gap devices comprising a plurality of semiconducting nanoribbons disposed on a substrate or comprising a plurality of stacks disposed on a substrate with each stack having a plurality of semiconducting nanoribbons. Each nanoribbon in the plurality of semiconducting nanoribbons is characterized by a band gap, and is in electrical communication with two conductive leads.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Also disclosed herein are multiple band gap devices comprising one or more semiconducting nanohole superlattices comprising one or more stacks disposed on a substrate with each stack having one or more semiconducting nanohole superlattices. Each nanohole superlattice is characterized by a band gap range, and is in electrical communication with two conductive leads.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The instant multiple band gap devices can be used for various applications, for example, as photovoltaic solar cells for converting light into power, as photodetectors for converting an incident light into detectable signals, and as light emitting diodes (LEDs) for lighting when connected to an external current.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">6.1. Characteristics of Semiconducting Nanoribbons</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Semiconducting nanoribbons can be fabricated from a number of layered crystalline materials by microfabrication techniques such as photolithographic pattering or by E-beam and/or interference lithography nanopatterning. Suitable materials include graphite (C), boron nitride (BN), molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>), tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>). These materials have a similar layered structure. Within each layer, atoms are bound by strong covalent bonds, whereas the layers are held together by weak van der Waals forces.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">One suitable form of nanoribbon is graphitic (graphene or graphite) nanoribbons. Graphene nanoribbons are one layer carbon strips. Graphite nanoribbons are made of stacked graphene layers. A review of graphene and graphite nanoribbons is found in Nano Today 5, 351, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Additional description of graphene and graphite nanoribbons is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,858,876 to Lagally et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. By way of illustration, graphitic nanoribbons are described herein to demonstrate the characteristics of semiconducting nanoribbons and how the present disclosure takes the advantage of these characteristics to develop multiple band gap devices.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As a nanostructure, graphitic nanoribbons exhibit useful physicochemical and electrical properties different from those observed in bulk (See, Nano Today 5, 351 and Physical Review B 76, 121405(R) (2007)). One of the useful characteristics for the development of the present multiple band gap devices is that the band gaps of semiconducting graphitic nanoribbons can be tuned and controlled by varying nanoribbon width, thickness, edge state, doping and other factors. Such characteristics provide material with adjustable band gaps coupled with methods to tune the band gaps. Through optimization of nanoribbon width, thickness, edge state, doping and/or other factors, it is possible to fabricate nanoribbons that have specific band gaps and produce multiple band gap devices that achieve improved efficiency at reduced costs.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Another useful characteristic for some of the instant multiple band gap devices arises from the nature of the charge carriers (electrons or holes) in nanoribbons, which have a high carrier mobility due to the nature of being a two-dimensional material with weaker scattering than most other materials. The multiple band gap devices disclosed herein are configured to have the current flow along the length of the nanoribbons, that is, from one end to the other end of the nanoribbons. As a result, no current balancing is required, and the efficiency of the devices is not limited by the lowest current. In addition, it is unnecessary for interfaces between nanoribbon layers to have low resistance. This simplifies fabrication because it removes any requirement for tunneling junctions or other structures.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Still another useful characteristic of the graphitic nanoribbons disclosed herein is that their work functions are not strongly dependent upon their widths.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">6.2. Characteristics of Semiconducting Nanohole Superlattices</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As used herein the term &#x201c;semiconducting nanohole superlattice&#x201d; refers to a layered crystalline material having an array of nanoholes defined therein. The nanohole superlattice may comprise one sheet of the layered crystalline material or multiple vertically stacked sheets of the layered crystalline material.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18(</figref><i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) depict a semiconducting nanohole superlattice <b>130</b> with triangular nanoholes <b>132</b> and with rectangular nanoholes <b>134</b> respectively. Other shapes of nanoholes or combination of different shapes of nanoholes can be patterned within a layered crystalline material to make a semiconducting nanohole superlattice. Layered crystalline materials include, but not limited to, graphite (C), boron nitride (BN), molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>). The array of nanoholes can be produced using any suitable fabrication known in the art. For example, a nanohole superlattice structure may be patterned with one or more nanohole arrays using conventional photolithography techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Effectively, a nanohole superlattice is considered a two-dimensional network of crossing nanoribbons, in which the size, shape, density of the nanoholes define the shape and dimensions of the nanoribbons. Thus nanohole superlattices have similar characteristics to nanoribbons. For example, while not being bound by any particular theory, the tight-binding model indicates that band gaps of graphene nanohole superlattices increase linearly with the product of nanohole size and density. This is because the width of a nanoribbon in the two-dimensional network of crossing nanoribbons can be decreased by either increasing the sizes of nanoholes or increasing the number of nanoholes in one fixed unit. Other similar characteristics include larger mean free paths for charge carriers in nanohole superlattices and dependence or weak dependence of the work functions of nanohole superlattices on the size, shape, density of the nanoholes. These characteristics make it possible to design a device with nanohole superlattices in a similar way as nanoribbons.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In addition to having similar characteristics, a nanohole superlattice in general has several advantages compared to an individual nanoribbon. For example, a signal nanoribbon is typically fragile and hard to transfer from one substrate to another. A nanohole superlattice, however, is mechanically stronger and more stable due to the crossing network structure, thus easier to transfer to another substrate if needed. In addition, a nanohole superlattice usually provides more surfaces for absorbing or omitting light, and hence potentially higher efficiency for a device comprising such a nanohole superlattice. Furthermore, a nanohole superlattice tolerates defects better than an individual nanoribbon.</p>

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Using semiconducting nanoribbons or nanohole superlattices as a photon-absorbing or light-emitting material, the present disclosure provides a multiple band gap device that can efficiently convert photon energy to electricity, or vice versa, across all or a portion of a wide wavelength spectrum. In the case of semiconducting nanoribbons, the basic architecture of the multiple band gap device in accordance with the present disclosure includes a plurality of semiconducting nanoribbons that have multiple band gaps. The plurality of semiconducting nanoribbons are configured so that a nanoribbon with a first band gap absorbs a photon or emits a light within a first spectrum range and a nanoribbon with a second band gap absorbs a photon or emits a light within a second spectrum range. For example, the plurality of semiconducting nanoribbons may be arranged vertically by stacking one on top of another or arranged laterally by placing one next to another side by side.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In the case of semiconducting nanohole superlattices, the basic architecture of the multiple band gap device in accordance with the present disclosure includes one or more semiconducting nanohole superlattices. Each semiconducting nanohole superlattice is characterized by a band gap range, which can span a few meV or a few eV by control of nanohole patterns. For example, the band gap range of a nanohole superlattice may be controlled to be in the range of between 0.1 eV to 2 eV for absorbing solar radiation, or may be restrained at or near a desired single band gap value for detecting a light signal at a specific wavelength. Within the one or more nanohole superlattices, a nanohole superlattice may have different band gap range or value from other nanohole superlattices. Similar to nanoribbons, the one or more nanohole superlattices may be arranged vertically by stacking one on top of another or arranged laterally by placing one next to another side by side.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In addition to a plurality of semiconducting nanoribbons or one or more nanohole superlattices, the basic architecture of the multiple band gap devices in accordance with the present disclosure includes a first lead and a second lead, which are typically made of electrically conductive materials such as metals. In the case of nanoribbons, the first lead electrically contacts one end of each nanoribbon in the plurality of nanoribbons, and the second lead electrically contacts the other end of each nanoribbon in the plurality of nanoribbons. In the case of nanohole superlattices, the first lead electrically contacts one edge of each nanohole superlattice in one or more nanohole superlattices and the second lead electrically contacts the opposite edge of each nanohole superlattice in one or more nanohole superlattices. Depending on the application, the first lead or the second lead may form a Schottky barrier or ohmic contact at the interface between the lead and one end of the nanoribbons or between the lead and one edge of the nanohole superlattices.</p>

<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) is a nanoribbon or nanohole superlattice <b>110</b> in contact with electrically conductive leads <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> at each end. The energy band diagrams of each material are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>c</i>), where <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>) illustrates the energy band diagrams before the materials are connected to each other and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>c</i>) illustrates the energy diagrams after contacts are made and equilibrium is achieved. For demonstration, the first lead <b>106</b> has a work function &#x3a6;<sub>1 </sub>smaller than that of the nanoribbon or nanohole superlattice <b>110</b> &#x3a6;<sub>R </sub>and the second lead <b>108</b> has a work function &#x3a6;<sub>2 </sub>larger than that of the nanoribbon or nanohole superlattice <b>110</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>), the Fermi levels of the materials are misaligned by their work function differences before intimate contacts are made. When the three materials are brought into contact as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>), however, their Fermi levels must line up creating Schottky barriers at the contacts. As a result, an electric field is generated in the nanoribbon or nanohole superlattice <b>110</b>, with a built-in potential V<sub>bi </sub>that equals to the work function difference between the two leads.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">For the ideal case of a short intrinsic nanoribbon or nanohole superlattice, V<sub>bi </sub>may decrease linearly over the whole nanoribbon or nanohole superlattice, from the second contact formed with the second lead <b>108</b> to the first contact formed with the first lead <b>106</b>, like the vacuum level shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>c</i>). For a very long and doped nanoribbon or nanohole superlattice, the doping level may be pinned, or the Fermi energy of the nanoribbon or nanohole superlattice will remain constant in the middle portion of the nanoribbon or nanohole superlattice. Then, in this case, the conduction and valence bands will be flat in the middle portion of the nanoribbon or nanohole superlattice, but bend downward near the contact formed with the lead <b>106</b> and upward near the contact formed with the lead <b>108</b>, respectively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>c</i>). The built-in field can separate electron-hole pairs generated by incident photons, creating a current in the nanoribbon or nanohole superlattice for a photovoltaic device or a photodetector. The built-in field can also inject carriers (electrons from one end and hole from the other end) to the nanoribbon or nanohole superlattice for emitting light.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">It is not necessary to have one lead with a work function smaller than that of the nanoribbon or nanohole superlattice and the other with a work function larger than that of the nanoribbon or nanohole superlattice. In some embodiments, the first lead may (i) have a work function different from that of the nanoribbon or nanohole superlattice and (ii) form a Schottky barrier for electrons at the contact with the nanoribbon while the second lead either forms a smaller Schottky barrier for electrons or does not form a Schottky barrier for electrons at all. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the first lead may be selected to have a work function different from that of the nanoribbon or nanohole superlattice and to form a Schottky barrier for holes at the contact with the nanoribbon or nanohole superlattice while the second lead either forms a smaller Schottky barrier for holes or does not form a Schottky barrier for holes at all.

<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In some embodiments, the nanoribbons or nanohole superlattices of the instant disclosure are made of pure or doped graphitic films. In some embodiments they are made of other materials, for instance, BN, MoS<sub>2</sub>, WS<sub>2</sub>, ZnO, TiO<sub>2</sub>, or some combination thereof. Suitable materials for making the electrically conductive leads include, but are not limited to, Ti, Nb, Zn, Cr, Ag, Al, Co, Pd, Cu, Pt, and Au or some combination thereof, or some alloy thereof, with Ti and Pd preferable for graphitic nanoribbons or nanohole superlattices in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">It is advantageous to have a built-in potential V<sub>bi </sub>in between the two ends of the nanoribbon or nanohole superlattice. Upon excitation of an incident light, free electrons will be generated within the nanoribbon or nanohole superlattice and flow from one end to the other end of the nanoribbon or nanohole superlattice. When stacking a plurality of nanoribbons or nanohole superlattices, one on top of another, to make a multiple band gap device in accordance to the present disclosure, generated free electrons will still flow from one end to the other end.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">6.3.2. Formation of Multiple Band Gaps</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Advantageously, multiple band gap devices of the present disclosure utilize the same or similar semiconducting material to construct a plurality of nanoribbons or one or more nanohole superlattices that have multiple band gaps. An advantage of using essentially the same material is that lattice constant matching is eliminated, which simplifies the fabrication process and thus reduces the manufacturing costs. Multiple band gaps for the plurality of nanoribbons is achieved in some embodiments by controlling or modifying nanoribbon width, thickness, edge state, doping or other parameters. In some embodiments, suitable nanoholes are implemented to tune the band gaps of nanoribbons. Similarly, multiple band gaps for the one or more nanohole superlattices can be achieved by controlling or modifying nanoholes patterned therein, thickness, edge state, doping or other parameters. Through optimization, the plurality of nanoribbons or the one or more nanohole superlattices are tuned to the predicted ideal multiple band gaps, resulting in a multiple band gap device that has an improved efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Effect of nanoribbon width. The band gaps of semiconducting graphitic nanoribbons change with the nanoribbon width. While not intended to be limited to any particular theory, it particular theory, it is believed that the band gap of a semiconducting graphene nanoribbon is inversely proportional to the nanoribbon width. Thus, for a single-layer bare-edge graphene nanoribbon, the calculated widths have been reported to be in the range of 1-2 nm for band gaps of 1.1&#x2dc;1.4 eV and 2&#x2dc;3 nm for 0.7 eV (See, Nano Letters 6(12), 2748-2754 (2006)). However, pure bare-edge graphene nanoribbons are seldom realized. More typically, there exists natural or induced &#x201c;defects&#x201d; that change the structure and the properties of nanoribbons. With regard to the band gap of a semiconducting graphene nanoribbon, these &#x201c;defects&#x201d; include crystallographic orientation, edge termination, and doping. For instance, doping has been observed to considerably increase the band gap of graphene (See, Inscience Journal 1(2), 80-89 (2011)).</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Through doping, and/or variation of other factors, it is possible to produce nanoribbons that have a band gap between 0.1 eV and 2.2 eV at a nanoribbon width between 1 nm and 60 nm. Nanoribbons for the instant multiple band gap devices encompass this band gap range and nanoribbon width range.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Effect of nanoribbon thickness. Nanoribbon thickness affects the electronic structure of the semiconducting nanoribbons (See, Nano Today 5, 351-372 (2010) and Nature Materials 6(3):183-191, (2007)). In general, the band gap decreases with the increase of the number of layers.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Coupling with other factors, such as doping or variation of nanoribbon width, the instant multiple band gap devices comprise nanoribbons that contain a monolayer nanopatterned graphene, multilayer graphene sheets, or graphite with several hundreds of graphene sheets. Corresponding nanoribbon thickness is typically in between a nanometer to several micrometers.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Effect of edge state. Edge state can also affect the properties of nanoribbons. Graphene nanoribbons with zigzag edges have electronic characteristics different from a graphene nanoribbon with armchair edges. Zigzag edges provide the edge localized state with non-bonding molecular orbitals near the Fermi energy. Calculations based on tight binding predict that zigzag graphene nanoribbons are always metallic while armchair graphene nanoribbons can be either metallic or semiconducting, depending on their width. Calculations and experiments show that energy band gaps of semiconducting armchair nanoribbons increase with the decrease of nanoribbon width. Some recent reports indicate that zigzag nanoribbons are also semiconducting due to an unusual antiferromagnetic coupling between the magnetic moments at opposite edges. This behavior can be traced back to the spatial distribution properties of edge-state wave functions, and the mostly local character of the exchange interaction that originates the spin polarization. In addition, edge termination and/or anchoring with different atoms or molecules on edges also modify the properties of nanoribbons (See, Nano Today 5, 351-372 (2010)). For example, the edges of graphene nanoribbons can be terminated or anchored by carboxyl (COOH), carbonyl (COH), hydrogenated (CH) and amines (NH<sub>2</sub>). Such edge terminations by attaching alien atoms or molecules can be considered as an effective doping.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Depending on the application and desired band gaps, the instant multiple band gap devices can comprise armchair nanoribbons, zigzag nanoribbons, or a combination of both. The edges of the nanoribbons can also be terminated with different atoms or molecules, at different concentrations, or different penetrations. The edge terminations can also coupled with variations of other factors to optimize the band gaps.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Effect of doping. Doping allows for the modification of the band structure and the expansion of the possible band gaps that graphene or graphite can adopt (See, Inscience Journal 1(2), 80-89 (2011) and Nano Today 5, 351-372 (2010)). Graphene doping can be roughly classified into three categories: (i) hetero atom doping, (ii) chemical modification, and (iii) electrostatic field tuning. In hetero atom doping, boron (B), nitrogen (N) and bismuth (Bi) doping has been reported. For instance, N-doping in graphene nanoribbons has been achieved by chemical vapor deposition, through electrothermal reaction with NH<sub>3 </sub>or through NH<sub>3 </sub>annealing after N<sup>+</sup>-ion irradiation (See, Science 324 (5928), 768-771 (2009) and Journal of the American Chemical Society 131(43), 15939-1594 (2009)). In addition, fluorine (F) doping has been reported (See, Nano Letters 10(8), 3001, (2010)). In chemical modification, nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) have been used and generation of opposite charge carriers has been confirmed. In electrostatic field tuning, modification of the properties of graphene is achieved by controlling the reversible charges of carrier concentration and the Fermi level without increasing the level of disorders and defects in graphene. Furthermore, the doping concentration and gradient can be controlled by tuning the specific conditions of doping processes.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Since there exists a variety of dopants and doping can be accomplished at different concentrations or with different gradients, it is believed that the band gap in between 0.1 eV to 2.2 eV can be realized for a semiconducting graphene nanoribbon. The instant multiple band gap devices typically comprise nanoribbons that have band gaps within this range.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Effect of nanoholes. Nanoholes play an important role in determining the electronic properties of nanohole superlattices. Band gaps of such superlattices depends on the structural features of the nanohole superlattice, including the nanohole size, nanohole shape, and nanohole density. Nanohole density is defined as the number of nanoholes patterned over a unit surface area of the layered crystalline material. Although not intending to be bound by any particular theory, a tight-binding model reveals that band gaps of graphene nanohole superlattices increase linearly with the product of nanohole size and density (See, Physical Review B 80, 233405 (2009)). It has been reported that a substantial band gap, about 0.435 eV, opens up at Fermi level. Information on nanohole superlattices can be also found in Nano Letters 10, 1125-1131 (2010) and Nano Research 1, 56-62 (2008).</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">As noted above, nanohole superlattices may be considered as a two-dimensional network of crossing nanoribbons. Thus in general, the band gaps of nanohole superlattices are expected to increase with the decreasing nanoribbon width due to stronger quantum-confinement. Within a nanohole superlattice, the characteristic nanoribbon width can be decreased by increasing the size of nanoholes or the number of nanoholes at a fixed size of superlattice. The characteristic nanoribbon width can also be decreased by decreasing the size of superlattice while retaining the size of nanoholes and the number of nanoholes. Again, not intending to be bound by any particular theory, a tight-binding model confirms that band gaps of graphene nanohole superlattices increase due to the finite-size effect of nanoribbon crossing network (See, Physical Review B 80, 233405 (2009)) and band gaps of graphene nanohole superlattices can span a wide range from 0 eV to about 2.5 eV (See, Nano Research 1, 56-62 (2008).</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Similar to nanoribbons, the band gaps of nanohole superlattices can be further tuned by variations of its thickness, by doping or by modification of other parameters. Thus, incorporating nanohole superlattices with different size, shape, density, or with variation of other parameters make it possible to develop a device that can absorb or emit light efficiently across the desired wavelength spectrum.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Other factors. There are other ways to modify the band structure and change the band gap of graphene (See, Inscience Journal 1(2), 80-89 (2011)). These methods include using contacts between graphene and metals, applying strain to graphene and biasing bilayer graphene.</p>

<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The plurality of stacks is lengthwise arranged on a substrate <b>102</b>, more specifically on a surface <b>114</b> of the substrate <b>102</b>, with each stack in the plurality of stacks occupying a different portion of the substrate.

In yet other embodiments, each stack in the plurality of stacks comprises more than three nanoribbons. In still yet other embodiments, the number of nanoribbons comprised by some stacks in the plurality of stacks may be different from the number of nanoribbons comprised by other stacks in the plurality of stacks. For example, some stacks in the plurality of stacks may comprise two nanoribbons while other stacks in the plurality of stacks may comprise three or more nanoribbons.</p>

Each of these three nanoribbons is in intimate contact with the first lead <b>106</b> at one end as indicated by <b>116</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>116</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>116</b>-<b>3</b> and in intimate contact with the second lead <b>108</b> as indicated by <b>118</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>118</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>118</b>-<b>3</b>. Collectively, elements <b>116</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>116</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>116</b>-<b>3</b> define the first end of the stack while elements <b>118</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>118</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>118</b>-<b>3</b> define the second end of the stack.

The distance L between the first lead and the second lead, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, defines the length of the stack.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The first lead <b>106</b> and the second lead <b>108</b> are made of electrically conducting materials, typically metals. Suitable materials for making the electrically conductive leads include titanium (Ti), niobium (Nb), zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr), silver (Ag), aluminum (Al), cobalt (Co), palladium (Pd), copper (Cu), platinum (Pt), and gold (Au). Ti and Pd are preferable for graphitic nanoribbons. In some embodiments, the first lead <b>106</b> is in intimate contact with the first end of each stack in the plurality of stacks, serving as one common lead. Likewise, the second lead is in intimate contact with the second end of each stack in the plurality of stacks, severing as another common lead.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">For embodiments with each stack having two nanoribbons, the first nanoribbon <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> is overlaid on the substrate surface <b>114</b>, then a first optically transparent insulator <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> overlaying the first nanoribbon, followed by the second nanoribbon <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> overlaying the first insulator <b>112</b>-<b>1</b>. The first nanoribbon is characterized by a first band gap and the second nanoribbon is characterized by a second band gap, where the first band gap is smaller than the second band gap. The first band gap can be tuned to a desired value by varying the width, thickness or edge state of the first nanoribbon, by doping the first nanoribbon, or by modifying the combination of these parameters. Similarly, the second band gap can be tuned to another desired value.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">For embodiments with each stack having three or more nanoribbons, similar structure can be employed by overlaying a layer of nanoribbon and a layer of optically transparent insulator alternatively on top of each other. For instance, to make a stack with three nanoribbons, a second optically transparent insulator <b>112</b>-<b>2</b> can be overlaid on the second nanoribbon <b>110</b>-<b>2</b>, and a third nanoribbon <b>110</b>-<b>3</b> overlaid on the second insulator, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.

<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The optically transparent insulator (e.g. <b>112</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>112</b>-<b>2</b>) inbetween two adjacent nanoribbon layers electrically separates one nanoribbon layer from the other. The insulator is configured to have a band gap larger than the band gaps of the nanoribbons beneath it, so that the insulator is optically transparent to photons that can be absorbed or emitted by the nanoribbons below. In some embodiments, the optically transparent insulator is made of a glass, such as aluminosilicate glass, borosilicate glass, dichroic glass, germanium/semiconductor glass, glass ceramic, silicate/fused silica glass, soda lime glass, quartz glass, chalcogenide/sulphide glass, fluoride glass, flint glass, or cereated glass. In some embodiments, the optically transparent insulator is made of a urethane polymer, an acrylic polymer, a fluoropolymer, a silicone, a silicone gel, an epoxy, a polyamide, or a polyolefin.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">When exposed to light, the plurality of nanoribbons (e.g. <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>110</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>110</b>-<b>3</b>) absorb photons and produces a current, a voltage or both, depending on the nature of the electrodes that flank the plurality of nanoribbons. The process is as follows. Photons with energy above the third band gap are absorbed by the third nanoribbon <b>110</b>-<b>3</b> whereas photons with energy below the third band gap of the third nanoribbon transmit to the second nanoribbon <b>110</b>-<b>2</b>. Once in the second nanoribbon, photons with energy above the second band gap are absorbed by the second nanoribbon and photons with energy below the second band gap transmit to the first nanoribbon <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>. The absorption and transmission process continues until photons with energy below the first band gap transmit to the substrate <b>102</b>. Such configuration achieves a multiple band gap photovoltaic device or a multiple band gap photodetector.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">When a multiple band gap device in accordance to the present disclosure is connected to an external current, a reverse process takes place. Electrons in the plurality of nanoribbons recombine with holes, emitting a light. The first nanoribbon <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> emits a light that has a lower energy than the second band gap. As a result, the second nanoribbon -<b>2</b> appears to be optically transparent to the light emitted by the first nanoribbon. Since the third band gap is larger than the second band gap, the third nanoribbon <b>110</b>-<b>3</b> appears to be optically transparent to the light emitted by the first nanoribbon as well. Consequently, the light emitted by the first nanoribbon transmit all the way to the surface of the multiple band gap device. Likewise, the lights emitted by the second and third nanoribbons transmit to the outside. The lights emitted by the plurality of nanoribbons then interfere with each other and produce a hybrid light. Such a configuration produces a multiple band gap LED.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">As mentioned in previous sections, band gaps of semiconducting nanoribbons can be tuned or controlled by varying their width, thickness, edge state, doping or combination of these and other factors. By way of illustration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts a multiple band gap device in which each stack has three nanoribbons and desired band gap for each nanoribbon is achieved by the control of nanoribbon width W and/or thickness D.

The second nanoribbon is characterized by a width larger than the width of the third nanoribbon. As a result, the third nanoribbon on the top has the largest band gap among the three nanoribbons.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">However, the third nanoribbon <b>110</b>-<b>3</b> on the top does not necessarily need to be the smallest.

<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Band gaps for a multiple band gap photodetector in accordance with the present disclosure depend on the spectrum of the incident light that needs to be measured. If the spectrum of the incident light is within the infrared range, the band gaps of nanoribbons can be set at lower values, for instance, below 1.0 eV. Accordingly, in some embodiments nanoribbons have a width larger than 30 nm. On the other hand, nanoribbons must have larger band gaps, for instance, above 1.5 eV, if the spectrum of the incident light is within the ultraviolet range. Accordingly, in some embodiments nanoribbons have a width less than 20 nm. For measuring a spectral range within the visible light, in some embodiments, band gaps have the same values as a multiple band gap photovoltaic device. In applications where the spectrum of the incident light spans a broader range, for instance, from infrared to ultraviolet where a wavelength ranges inbetween 10 nm to 100 &#x3bc;m, each stack in the plurality of stacks may comprise more than three layers of nanoribbons, with each nanoribbon tuned to selectively absorb photons in a specifically targeted spectral range.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Similarly, for a multiple band gap LED in accordance with the present disclosure, the number of nanoribbons in a stack and the band gap for each nanoribbon depend on the application. For instance, if a white light is desired, in some embodiments the multiple band gap LED comprises a plurality of stacks, with each stack having three nanoribbons. The band gap of each nanoribbon is tuned and controlled so that the first nanoribbon at the bottom has the smallest band gap, the third nanoribbon on the top has the largest band gap, and the second nanoribbon in the middle has a band gap between the largest and smallest band gaps. Upon application of an electric source, the first, second, and third nanoribbons emit a red light, a green light, and a blue light, respectively. If in the right proportion, the red, green and blue lights collectively emit a white light thus creating a white light LED.</p>

In some embodiments, each stack in the plurality of stacks is identical. In other embodiments, one stack in the plurality of stacks is different from another stack in the plurality of stacks. For instance, the first band gap of the first nanoribbon <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> of stack <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> in the plurality of stacks has a different band gap than the first band gap of the first nanoribbon <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> of stack <b>104</b>-<b>3</b>. The second band gap of the second nanoribbon <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> of stack <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> in the plurality of stacks has a different band gap than the second band gap of the second nanoribbon <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> of stack <b>104</b>-<b>3</b>. In other embodiments, the difference among the plurality of stacks take place in terms of other characteristics, such as nanoribbon width, thickness, edge state, dopants, doping concentration, or doping gradient. In yet other embodiments, the difference among the plurality of stacks arises in terms of the length or the number of nanoribbons that each stack may have. In still yet other embodiments, the difference among the plurality of stacks occurs because the semiconducting material used for one stack is different from the semiconducting material used for another stack. In some embodiments, a stack, for instance the stack <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>, is different from stack <b>104</b>-<b>2</b>, which in turn is different from <b>104</b>-<b>3</b>. In other embodiments, some stacks have optimal band gaps different from other stacks, targeting different spectral ranges. In such configurations, care is taken so that nanoribbons within each stack are stacked in order based on the band gaps, with the top nanoribbon having the largest band gap and the bottom nanoribbon having the smallest band gap.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The thickness D of a nanoribbon, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, can have a wide range spanning from nanometers to micrometers, corresponding to a nanoribbon that contains a monolayer nanopatterned graphene sheet to several hundreds of graphene sheets. In some embodiments, a nanoribbon comprises between 1 and 300 graphene nanoribbon sheets. In some embodiments, a nanoribbon comprises between 100 and 300 graphene nanoribbon sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">As indicated by L in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the length of the nanoribbons is defined by the distance between the first lead and the second lead. Taking advantage of large mean free path of the nanoribbon, the length of the nanoribbons in the plurality of stacks in accordance with the present disclosure is typically in the range of a few micrometers to several hundreds of micrometers. In some embodiments, length L is inbetween 1 &#x3bc;m and 100 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">A typical multiple band gap device in accordance with the present disclosure includes billions (or even trillions) of nanoribbons, depending on the density and dimensions of the plurality of stacks. It is possible to design a multiple band gap device having a stack density between 10<sup>6 </sup>to 10<sup>12 </sup>stacks/cm<sup>2</sup>, with each stack can have two or more nanoribbons.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Optionally, the top nanoribbon or a portion of the top nanoribbon in each stack or in some stacks is coated with an antireflection layer <b>120</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The anti-reflection layer is typically made of dielectric materials, such as SiO<sub>2 </sub>and TiO<sub>2</sub>. In other embodiments it is made of semiconducting materials, such as InGaAs. The semiconducting material used for the coating, however, should have a band gap larger than the band gap of the top nanoribbon so that it is optically transparent to photons within the targeted wavelength range. Alternatively, doping is utilized to open up the band gap of a semiconducting material for use as the antireflection coating.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Typically, the antireflection layer has a thickness in the range of tens to thousands of nanometers. For a photovoltaic device or a photodetector in accordance to the present disclosure, the thickness of the anti-reflection layer may be selected and controlled to be one quarter of the wavelength of the incoming wave. As such, the wave reflected from the top surface of the anti-reflection layer destructively interferes with the wave reflected from the nanoribbon surfaces, resulting in zero net reflected energy and hence all light transmitted into the nanoribbons. Similarly, the thickness of the anti-reflection layer for a light emitting device in accordance to the present disclosure may be selected and controlled so that all light emitted from the nanoribbons are transmitted out of the nanoribbons and the anti-reflection layer. To take the advantage of wave destructive and constructive interferences, more than one layer of antireflection coating may be employed to further increase the efficiency of the devices.</p>

In some embodiments, the multiple band gap device <b>300</b> comprises a plurality of semiconducting nanoribbons (<b>304</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>304</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . <b>304</b>-N), with each nanoribbon in electrical communication with a first lead <b>106</b> and a second lead <b>108</b>. The multiple band gap device further comprises an optical splitter <b>310</b> that is in optical communication with the plurality of nanoribbons, if the multiple band gap device is a photovoltaic device or a photodetector. A multiple band gap LED in accordance with the present disclosure, however, does not need an optical splitter.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The plurality of semiconducting nanoribbons (<b>304</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>304</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . <b>304</b>-N) is lengthwise arranged on a substrate <b>102</b>, more specifically on the surface <b>114</b> of the substrate <b>102</b>, with each nanoribbon in the plurality of nanoribbons spatially separated from each other. As in the vertically stacked architecture, the substrate is typically planar, either rigid or flexible, and can be made of the same materials as described in the previous section.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">To make a multiple band gap device, some nanoribbons in the plurality of semiconducting nanoribbons have a different band gap than other nanoribbons in the plurality of semiconducting nanoribbons. Different band gaps can be achieved by using different materials or by tuning the nanoribbon width, thickness, edge state, doping or other factors. By way of illustration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-11</figref> depict an embodiment where the different bad gaps are achieved by varying the nanoribbon width, or by varying the nanoribbon width along with other factors. For instance, both width and thickness of nanoribbon <b>304</b>-<b>1</b> are different from those of nanoribbon <b>304</b>-<b>3</b>. However, variation of width and/or thickness can be considered as a representative for turning the band gap. Other factors may be used to modify the band gap without changing the nanoribbon width and/or thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>, nanoribbon <b>304</b>-<b>3</b> has a width that is wider than nanoribbon <b>304</b>-<b>2</b>, which in turn has a width that is wider than nanoribbon <b>304</b>-<b>1</b>. This represents embodiments where nanoribbon <b>304</b>-<b>3</b> has a band gap smaller than nanoribbon <b>304</b>-<b>2</b>, and nanoribbon <b>304</b>-<b>2</b> has a band gap smaller than nanoribbon <b>304</b>-<b>1</b>. Accordingly, nanoribbon <b>304</b>-<b>3</b> absorbs or emits photons that have longer wavelengths than nanoribbon <b>304</b>-<b>2</b>, and nanoribbon <b>304</b>-<b>2</b> absorbs or emits photons that have longer wavelengths than nanoribbon <b>304</b>-<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Similar to the vertically stacked architecture described in the previous section, each nanoribbon in the plurality of nanoribbons is defined by a first end <b>316</b>, a second <b>318</b> and a length L, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. In some embodiments, the first end <b>316</b> of each nanoribbon in the plurality of nanoribbons is in intimate contact with the first lead <b>106</b>, thus forming a common lead. The second end <b>318</b> of each nanoribbon in the plurality of nanoribbons is in intimate contact with the second lead <b>108</b>, thus forming another common lead.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a multiple band gap device <b>300</b> in accordance with the present disclosure further comprises an optical splitter <b>310</b>, when used as a multiple band gap photovoltaic device or a multiple band gap photodetector. The optical splitter <b>310</b> splits an incident light into different wavelength bands and directs the different wavelength bands to corresponding nanoribbons. Based on the application, the optical splitter is a simple optic such as a prism or a spectrally selective system that splits an incident light into specifically targeted wavelength ranges. In some embodiments, the optical splitter is placed directly above the plurality of nanoribbons. In other embodiments, the optical splitter is disposed in a distance away from the plurality of nanoribbons. In yet other embodiments, the optical splitter is tilted and forms an angle with respect to the normal surface of the plurality of nanoribbons.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In some embodiments, where two wavelength ranges are targeted, the plurality of nanoribbons is divided into two groups. Each group includes at least one nanoribbon, and nanoribbons in one group having a different band gap from the other group. For instance, a first group has a band gap smaller than a second group. In such a configuration, the optical splitter <b>310</b> splits an incident light into two different wavelength bands, with the first wavelength band characterized by at least one wavelength that is greater than the wavelengths in the second wavelength band. The optical splitter then directs the first light wavelength band to the first group and the second wavelength band to the second group.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">In some embodiments where three wavelength ranges are targeted, the plurality of nanoribbons is divided into three groups, with nanoribbons in each group having a different band gap from the other two groups. For example, a first group has a band gap smaller than a second group, which in turn has a band gap smaller than a third group. Accordingly, the optical splitter splits an incident light into three wavelength bands. A first wavelength band in the three wavelength bands is characterized by at least one wavelength that is greater than the wavelengths in a second wavelength band in the three wavelength bands; and the second wavelength band is characterized by at least one wavelength that is greater than the wavelengths in a third wavelength band in the three wavelength bands. In such embodiments, the optical splitter directs the three wavelength bands to corresponding nanoribbon groups.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In some embodiments, a multiple band gap light emitting diode in accordance with the present disclosure is configured so that no optical splitter is needed for combining a light from different wavelength bands emitted from the plurality of nanoribbons. In such a configuration, nanoribbons having different band gaps are placed near to each other. Since the dimension of nanoribbons or a group of nanoribbons is in the micrometer range, emission from these nanoribbons is indistinguishable by human eyes. Collectively, a multiple band gap LED in accordance with the present disclosure emits a light comprising multiple wavelength bands. For instance, in some embodiments, some nanoribbons emit a red light, some emit a green light, and others emit a blue light. In combination, the multiple band gap LED appears to emit a white light to human eyes. In other embodiments, a multiple band gap LED in accordance with the present disclosure may comprise an optical splitter <b>310</b> to combine the lights from different wavelength bands for desired applications.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Except for the fact that they are laid out side by side next to each other, laterally spaced nanoribbons are substantially the same as those of vertically stacked nanoribbons described in the previous sections. For instance, nanoribbons can be made of the same materials using the same nanopatterning processes, and have substantially the same dimensions including width, length, and thickness. That is, laterally spaced nanoribbons in general have a width in between 1 nm and 60 nm, and a multiple band gap device that comprises a plurality of laterally spaced nanoribbons typically has a nanoribbon density between 10<sup>6 </sup>to 10<sup>12 </sup>nanoribbons/cm<sup>2</sup>. In addition, parameters described in the previous sections, including ranges of the band gap, are applicable for laterally spaced nanoribbons and for a multiple band gap device that comprises a plurality of laterally spaced nanoribbons.</p>

<p id="p-0183" num="0182">The first lead <b>106</b> and the second lead <b>108</b> are made of electrically conducting materials, typically metals. Suitable materials for making the electrically conductive leads include titanium (Ti), niobium (Nb), zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr), silver (Ag), aluminum (Al), cobalt (Co), palladium (Pd), copper (Cu), platinum (Pt), and gold (Au).

The first band gap can be tuned to a desired value. Similarly, the second band gap can be tuned to another desired value.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">For embodiments in which the stack has three or more nanohole superlattices, similar structure can be employed by overlaying a nanohole superlattice and a layer of optically transparent insulator alternatively on top of each other. For instance, to make a stack with three nanohole superlattice, a second optically transparent insulator <b>2012</b>-<b>2</b> can be overlaid on the second nanohole superlattice <b>110</b>-<b>2</b>, and a third nanohole superlattice <b>110</b>-<b>3</b> overlaid on the second insulator <b>2012</b>-<b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>.

<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Optically transparent insulator (e.g. <b>2012</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>2012</b>-<b>2</b>) in between two adjacent nanohole superlattice electrically separates one nanohole superlattice from the other. The insulator is configured to have a band gap larger than the band gaps of the nanohole superlattice beneath it, so that the insulator is optically transparent to photons that can be absorbed or emitted by the nanohole superlattice below. In some embodiments, optically transparent insulator is made of a glass, such as aluminosilicate glass, borosilicate glass, dichroic glass, germanium/semiconductor glass, glass ceramic, silicate/fused silica glass, soda lime glass, quartz glass, chalcogenide/sulphide glass, fluoride glass, flint glass, or cereated glass. In some embodiments, optically transparent insulator is made of a urethane polymer, an acrylic polymer, a fluoropolymer, a silicone, a silicone gel, an epoxy, a polyamide, or a polyolefin.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">When exposed to light, the plurality of nanohole superlattices (e.g. <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>110</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>110</b>-<b>3</b>) absorb photons and produce a current, a voltage or both, depending on the nature of the electrodes that flank the plurality of nanohole superlattices. The process is as follows. Photons with energy above the third band gap are absorbed by the third nanohole superlattice <b>110</b>-<b>3</b> whereas photons with energy below the third band gap of the third nanohole superlattice transmit to the second nanohole superlattice <b>110</b>-<b>2</b>. Once in the second nanohole superlattice, photons with energy above the second band gap are absorbed by the second nanohole superlattice and photons with energy below the second band gap transmit to the first nanohole superlattice <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>. The absorption and transmission process continues until photons with energy below the first band gap transmit to the substrate <b>102</b>. Such configuration achieves a multiple band gap photovoltaic device or a multiple band gap photodetector.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">When a multiple band gap device in accordance to the present disclosure is connected to an external current, a reverse process takes place. Electrons in the plurality of nanohole superlattice recombine with holes, emitting a light. The first nanohole superlattice <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> emits a light that has a lower energy than the second band gap. As a result, the second nanohole superlattice <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> appears to be optically transparent to the light emitted by the first nanohole superlattice. Since the third band gap is larger than the second band gap, the third nanohole superlattice <b>110</b>-<b>3</b> appears to be optically transparent to the light emitted by the first nanohole superlattice as well. Consequently, the light emitted by the first nanohole superlattice transmits all the way to the surface of the multiple band gap device. Likewise, the lights emitted by the second and third nanohole superlattice transmit to the outside. The lights emitted by the plurality of nanohole superlattice then interfere with each other and produce a hybrid light. Such a configuration produces a multiple band gap LED.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Generally, the band gaps of the nanohole superlattices are tuned in between 0.1 eV to 2.2 eV. In some embodiments where a nanohole superlattice stack comprises two nanohole superlattice, the first band gap is tuned and controlled to be between 0.1 eV to 1.2 eV, between 0.5 eV and 1.5 eV, or between 0.8 eV and 1.8 eV; the second band gap is configured to be between 0.8 eV and 1.9 eV, or between 1.2 eV and 2.2 eV, or between 1.5 eV and 2.2 eV. In some embodiments where a nanohole superlattice stack comprises three nanohole superlattices, the first band gap is tuned and controlled to be between 0.1 eV and 1.1 eV, between 0.4 eV and 1.3 eV, or between 0.6 eV and 1.5 eV; the second band gap is configured to be between 0.7 eV and 1.5 eV, between 1 eV and 1.7 eV, or between 1.2 and 2.1 eV; and the third band gap is configured to be between 1.4 eV to 2 eV, between 1.5 eV to 2.1 eV, or between 1.6 eV to 2.2 eV.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">In some embodiments, a first nanohole superlattice has a band gap of between 0.1 eV and 1.0 eV, between 0.4 eV and 1.4 eV, between 0.6 eV and 1.8 eV, or between 0.8 eV and 2.2 eV. In some embodiments a first nanohole superlattice has a band gap between 0.1 eV and 0.4 eV, between 0.4 eV and 0.8 eV, between 0.8 eV and 1.2 eV, between 1.2 eV and 1.6 eV, between 1.6 eV and 2.0 eV or between 2.0 eV and 2.2 eV.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">In some embodiments, a first nanohole superlattice has a band gap of between 0.1 eV and 1.0 eV, between 0.4 eV and 1.4 eV, between 0.6 eV and 1.8 eV, or between 0.8 eV and 2.2 eV and a second nanohole superlattice has a band gap, different than the band gap of the first nanohole superlattice, in the range of between 0.1 eV and 1.0 eV, between 0.4 eV and 1.4 eV, between 0.6 eV and 1.8 eV, or between 0.8 eV and 2.2 eV. In some embodiments a first nanohole superlattice has a band gap between 0.1 eV and 0.4 eV, between 0.4 eV and 0.8 eV, between 0.8 eV and 1.2 eV, between 1.2 eV and 1.6 eV, between 1.6 eV and 2.0 eV or between 2.0 eV and 2.2 eV and a second nanohole superlattice has a band gap, different than the band gap of the first nanohole superlattice, in the range of between 1 nm and 10 nm, between 10 nm and 20 nm, between 20 nm and 30 nm, between 30 nm and 40 nm, or between 40 nm and 50 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">Band gaps for a multiple band gap photodetector in accordance with the present disclosure depend on the spectrum of the incident light that needs to be measured. If the spectrum of the incident light is within the infrared range, the band gaps of the nanohole superlattice stack can be set at lower values, for instance, below 1.0 eV. On the other hand, nanohole superlattices must have larger band gaps, for instance, above 1.5 eV, if the spectrum of the incident light is within the ultraviolet range. For measuring a spectral range within the visible light, band gaps may have the same values as a multiple band gap photovoltaic device. In applications where the spectrum of the incident light spans a broader range, for instance, from infrared to ultraviolet where a wavelength ranges in between 10 nm to 100 &#x3bc;m, a nanohole superlattice stack may comprise more than three layers of nanohole superlattices, with each nanohole superlattice tuned to selectively absorb photons in a specifically targeted spectral range.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Similarly, for a multiple band gap LED in accordance with the present disclosure, the number of nanohole superlattices in a stack and the band gap for each nanohole superlattice is application dependent. For instance, if a white light is desired, the multiple band gap LED may comprise a plurality of nanohole superlattice stacks, with each nanohole superlattice stack having three nanohole superlattices. The band gaps of each nanohole superlattice is tuned and controlled so that the first nanohole superlattice at the bottom has the smallest band gap, the third nanohole superlattice on the top has the largest band gap, and the second nanohole superlattice in the middle has a band gap between the largest and smallest band gaps. Upon application of an electric source, the first, second, and third nanohole superlattice emit a red light, a green light, and a blue light, respectively. If in the right proportion, the red, green and blue lights collectively emit a white light thus creating a white light LED.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">A plurality of nanohole superlattice stacks may be arranged on a substrate. In some embodiments, each nanohole superlattice stack in the plurality of nanohole superlattice stacks is identical. In other embodiments, a first stack in the plurality of nanohole superlattice stacks is different from a second nanohole superlattice stack in the plurality of nanohole superlattice stacks. For instance, the first band gap of the first nanohole superlattice <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> of the first nanohole superlattice stack may have a different band gap than the first band gap of the first nanohole superlattice <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> of the second nanohole superlattice stack. The second band gap of the second nanohole superlattice <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> of the first nanohole superlattice stack may have a different band gap than the second band gap of the second nanohole superlattice <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> of the second nanohole superlattice stack. In other embodiments, the difference among the plurality of stacks may take place in terms of other characteristics, such as nanohole superlattice thickness, edge state, dopants, doping concentration, or doping gradient. In still yet other embodiments, the difference among the plurality of nanohole superlattice stacks may occur because the semiconducting material used for one nanohole superlattice stack is different from the semiconducting material used for another nanohole superlattice stack. In some embodiments, some nanohole superlattice stacks may have optimal band gaps different from other stacks, targeting different spectral ranges. In such configurations, care is taken so that nanohole superlattices within each stack are stacked in order based on the band gaps, with the top nanohole superlattice having the largest band gap and the bottom nanohole superlattice having the smallest band gap.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The thickness of a nanohole superlattice can have a wide range spanning from nanometers to micrometers, corresponding to a nanohole superlattice that contains a monolayer graphene nanohole superlattice sheet to several hundred graphene nanohole superlattice sheets. In some embodiments, a nanohole superlattice comprises between 1 and 300 graphene nanohole superlattice sheets. In some embodiments, a nanohole superlattice comprises between 100 and 300 graphene nanohole superlattice sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">Optionally, the top nanohole superlattice or a portion of the top nanohole superlattice in each stack or in some stacks can be coated with an antireflection layer. The anti-reflection layer is typically made of dielectric materials, such as SiO<sub>2 </sub>and TiO<sub>2</sub>, but it can also be made of semiconducting materials, such as InGaAs. The semiconducting material used for the coating, however, should have a band gap larger than the band gap of the top nanohole superlattice so that it is optically transparent to photons within the targeted wavelength range. Alternatively, doping may be utilized to open up the band gap of a semiconducting material for use as the antireflection coating.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Typically, the antireflection layer has a thickness in the range of tens to thousands of nanometers. For a photovoltaic device or a photodetector in accordance to the present disclosure, the thickness of the anti-reflection layer may be selected and controlled to be one quarter of the wavelength of the incoming wave. As such, the wave reflected from the top surface of the anti-reflection layer destructively interferes with the wave reflected from the nanohole superlattice surfaces, resulting in zero net reflected energy and hence all light transmitted into the nanohole superlattice. Similarly, the thickness of the anti-reflection layer for a light emitting device in accordance to the present disclosure may be selected and controlled so that all light emitted from the nanohole superlattice are transmitted out of the nanohole superlattice and the anti-reflection layer. To take the advantage of wave destructive and constructive interferences, more than one layer of antireflection coating may be employed to further increase the efficiency of the devices.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">In some embodiments, however, the architecture using semiconducting nanohole superlattices may comprise only one single nanohole superlattice. This is different from the architectures using nanoribbons, which require a plurality of nanoribbons to provide multiple band gaps. Unlike an individual nanohole superlattice with a restricted band gap at or near a band gap value, a single nanohole superlattice can have multiple band gaps or a band gap range because it is equivalent to a crossing network of a plurality of nanoribbons. By control of nanohole size, shape, density, and/or other parameters, one single nanohole superlattice can have multiple band gaps spanning a broad range, for example, from 0.1 eV to 2.2 eV. Likewise, by control of nanohole size, shape, and/or density, a nanohole superlattice can be tuned to a specific band gap value. To control the band gaps, a single nanohole superlattice can be selectively patterned with triangles, rectangles, hexagons, rhombuses, etc., or any combination thereof. The band gaps of the nanohole superlattice can be further tuned by variations of its thickness or doping.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">As an example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> depicts a schematic top view of a multiple band gap device comprising a nanohole superlattice <b>130</b> in accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure. The same as embodiments comprising nanoribbons, the nanohole superlattice is disposed on a substrate <b>102</b>. There are also two leads, the first lead <b>106</b> and the second lead <b>108</b>, electrically contacting two opposite edges of the nanohole superlattice. Patterned within the nanohole superlattice is an array of rectangular nanoholes <b>134</b>. By way of illustration, rectangular nanoholes <b>134</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> have different sizes and spacing, rendering the analogous nanoribbons within the nanohole superlattice <b>130</b> having different widths. Thus the nanohole superlattice <b>130</b> is expected to have multiple band gaps.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Depending on the application and the desired band gap range, an array of nanoholes having different shapes, sizes, densities, or any combination thereof may be used, or may be distributed differently within the nanohole superlattice. In addition, the nanohole superlattice may be doped, in bulk or on edges, with different dopants or concentrations, to further tune the band gap range. Other parameters, such as the thickness of the nanohole superlattice, may be varied as well to modify the band gap.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">As was the case with the disclosed nanoribbon based embodiments presented above, the first lead or the second lead may form a Schottky barrier or ohmic contact at the interface between the lead and the edge of the nanohole superlattice, depending on the application. Also, as was the case with the disclosed nanoribbon based embodiments presented above, embodiments using nanohole superlattices may or may not comprise an optical splitter depending on the application. For applications in which incident light is converted into electricity or detectable signals, a multiple band gap device in accordance with the present disclosure further comprises an optical splitter in optical communication with the nanohole superlattice. For light emission applications, however, a multiple band gap device in accordance with the present disclosure does not need an optical splitter.</p>

<p id="p-0220" num="0219">One aspect of the present disclosure provides a multiple band gap device comprising a plurality of stacks lengthwise arranged on a substrate, with each stack in the plurality of stacks occupying a different portion of the substrate. Each stack in the plurality of stacks is defined by a first end, a second end, and a length, and comprises (i) a plurality of semiconducting nanoribbons with one nanoribbon on top of another nanoribbon in the plurality of semiconducting nanoribbons and (ii) an optically transparent insulator disposed in between two adjacent nanoribbons. Each nanoribbon in the plurality of nanoribbons is characterized by a band gap. Within each stack, the band gap of a nanoribbon in the plurality of nanoribbons is larger than the band gaps of nanoribbons beneath it but is smaller than the band gaps of nanoribbons above it. The first end of each stack in the plurality of stacks electrically contacts a first lead while the second end of each stack in the plurality of stacks electrically contacts a second lead.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">The present multiple band gap device is operable by electrical control of the first lead and the second lead. Electrically connecting the first lead and the second lead to an external load, an external electrometer, or an external current creates a multiple band gap photovoltaic device, a multiple band gap photodetector, or a multiple band gap light emitting diode (LED), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">In some embodiments, each stack in the plurality of stacks comprises two nanoribbons and an optically transparent insulator in between. The first nanoribbon, characterized by a first band gap, overlays on the substrate and is overlaid by the optically transparent insulator. Then the second nanoribbon with a second band gap overlays on the insulator. In accordance with the present disclosure, the second band gap is larger than the first band gap. In some embodiments, each stack in the plurality of stacks comprises three nanoribbons and two optically transparent insulators with one insulator separating two adjacent nanoribbons. In such a configuration, the second insulator overlays onto the second nanoribbon and the third nanoribbon overlays onto the second insulator. The third nanoribbon is characterized by a third band gap larger than the second band gap, which is in turn larger than the first band gap. In some embodiments, each stack in the plurality of stacks comprises more than three nanoribbons.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">In some embodiments, each stack in the plurality of stacks is identical, whereas in other embodiments, one stack in the plurality of stacks is different from another stack in the plurality of stacks. The difference among the plurality of stacks may be in terms of the number of nanoribbons each stack has, the materials used for making the nanoribbons in each stack, the dimension of the nanoribbons, the edge state of the nanoribbons, doping applied in the nanoribbons, nanoholes patterned within the nanoribbons, or other factors. The difference may also occur when some stacks in the plurality of stacks have optimal band gaps different from other stacks, targeting different spectral ranges. For instance, the first nanoribbon of one stack in the plurality of stacks may have a different band gap than the first nanoribbon of another stack in the plurality of stacks; the second nanoribbon of one stack in the plurality of stacks may have a different band gap than the second nanoribbon of another stack in the plurality of stacks. In such a configuration, care is taken so that nanoribbons are arranged in descending order based on the band gaps, with the top nanoribbon having the largest band gap and the bottom nanoribbon having the smallest band gap within each stack.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">In some embodiments, the plurality of nanoribbons in the plurality of stacks is made of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), or lower grade graphite film, or other layered materials including boron nitride (BN), molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>), tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>). In some embodiments, the plurality of nanoribbons in the plurality of stacks is made by photolithographic pattering or by E-beam and/or interference lithography nanopatterning. In some embodiments, the band gaps of the plurality of nanoribbons is tuned or controlled by varying the widths, the thickness, or the edge states of the nanoribbons. In addition, tuning the band gaps can be accomplished by doping the nanoribbons with different dopants, at different concentration, or having different gradients. Suitable dopants include atoms or molecules of nitrogen, fluorine, phosphorus, or bismuth. In some embodiments, nanoribbon width, thickness, edge state, doping and/or other parameters is optimized concurrently to achieve a desired band gap. Furthermore, tuning the band gaps can also be achieved by patterning suitable nanoholes within the nanoribbons.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">In some embodiments, the instant multiple band gap devices may further comprise an antireflection layer overlaying all or a portion of each stack in the plurality of stacks. The anti-reflection layer may be made of dielectric materials, such as SiO<sub>2 </sub>and TiO<sub>2</sub>, or semiconducting materials, such as InGaAs. If a semiconducting material is used for the coating, doping may be utilized to open up the band gap of the semiconducting material so that it is optically transparent to photons within the targeted wavelength range.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">In some embodiments, the first and second leads are made of electrically conductive materials, such as titanium, niobium, zinc, chromium, silver, aluminum, cobalt, palladium, copper, platinum, gold, or an alloy thereof. In some embodiments, materials may be selected so that the first lead has a different work function than the nanoribbons and forms a Schottky barrier for a carrier at the interface between the lead and the nanoribbon while the second lead does not form a Schottky barrier at all or forms a smaller Schottky barrier for the carrier.</p>
