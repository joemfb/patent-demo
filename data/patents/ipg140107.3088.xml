<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to a metal-encapsulated, gas-insulated, combined, polyphase, such as a three-phase switch disconnector and earthing switch, which is accommodated in a housing.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A combined switch disconnector and earthing switch for a metal-encapsulated, gas-insulated high-voltage switchgear assembly is disclosed in EP 0 824 264 B1. The contact bolt for each phase is mounted displaceably in a housing element, wherein the lines of movement of the contact bolts run parallel to one another. The contact bolt is driven via a drive spindle, which is in the form of a rack-and-pinion gear and meshes with a rack section onto the contact bolt. The lines of movement of the contact bolts run at an angle of approximately 40&#xb0; in relation to the connecting conductors between two flanges.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">DE 24 14 200 A 1 discloses a metal-encapsulated switchgear assembly, in which a contact bolt is capable of moving to and fro within a carrier housing, wherein the contact bolt is connected to an active part in one position and to an earthing contact in a second position. The contact bolt is driven via a spindle, which runs parallel to the contact bolt, is capable of rotating and has an outer thread. An arm including a through-hole with an inner thread is fitted on the contact bolt perpendicular thereto, wherein the rotatable spindle passes through said arm, wherein the threaded rod is driven by an insulator, which is aligned therewith, or is set in rotation via rack-and-pinion gears from the longitudinal side of the combined switch disconnector and earthing switch. This switchgear assembly is a single-phase-encapsulated switchgear assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A similar construction of a metal-encapsulated switchgear assembly has also been disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,665,135.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">EP 0 678 952 A1 describes a combined switch disconnector and earthing switch, which are both actuated separately from one another, however.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure provide a combined switch disconnector and earthing switch of the type mentioned at the outset, in which the physical size is reduced and the actuation of the contact bolts is simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to exemplary embodiments of the disclosure, therefore, the lines of movement of the sliding contact bolts are located in one plane, wherein the sliding contact bolts can be driven by in each case one insulating spindle, which is aligned with the lines of movement of said sliding contact bolts; in this case, the drive spindle lies in the plane of the lines of movement and is coupled to the insulating spindles via in each case one deflecting gear mechanism, wherein the deflecting gear mechanisms for driving each contact bolt are accommodated in the earthing contact pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an exemplary embodiment, the deflecting gear mechanism is a bevel gear, whose bevel wheels are accommodated and mounted in the respective earthing contact piece.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another exemplary embodiment of the disclosure the insulating spindles each have an outer thread, which engages in an inner thread of in each case one contact bolt, wherein each contact bolt is impeded in terms of a rotation, with the result that, when the insulating spindles rotate, the contact bolts are shifted in one direction or the other.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The transmission ratio at the deflecting gear mechanism is a 1:1 transmission ratio, with the result that, when the drive spindle rotates, the insulating spindle also rotates in the same way. It is possible to draw a direct conclusion from observing the drive spindle on the movement of the insulating spindle with a scale of 1 to 1. If, in addition, the drive region in front of the drive spindle is also included, where there is also the transmission ratio of 1:1, it is possible to draw a direct conclusion on the movement of the insulating spindle from the movement of the starting point, for example a drive motor.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">This enables suitable positioning of auxiliary switches and other assemblies on the drive side and it is therefore possible for these to be used in a simple manner for indicating the situation on the output drive side, i.e. the insulating spindle and therefore the contact bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a sectional view through a combined switch disconnector and earthing switch in accordance with an exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A first active part <b>18</b>, in which a through-bore <b>19</b> is introduced having a mid-axis running parallel to the flange planes <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> and aligned approximately with the mid-axis of the connector <b>17</b> or the flange <b>14</b>, is located in the interior of the housing <b>11</b>. A contact bolt <b>20</b>, which is in the form of a sliding contact bolt, also referred to as contact bolt for short, is formed within the through-bore <b>19</b> and is electrically conductively connected, via sliding contact elements <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, to the active part <b>18</b>, which can also be referred to as the carrier part for the contact bolt <b>20</b>. The sliding contact bolt <b>20</b> is impeded from rotating by suitable means, for example by lateral longitudinally running flattened portions or else by a tongue-and-groove arrangement; it only moves linearly along its line of movement, which is also the mid-longitudinal axis of the contact bolt <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An insulating spindle <b>23</b>, which is connected to the contact bolt <b>20</b>, adjoins that end face of the contact bolt <b>20</b> which is opposite the flange <b>14</b>, wherein the insulating spindle <b>23</b> bears an outer thread, which meshes with an inner thread (not illustrated) within the contact bolt <b>20</b>. A second active part <b>24</b>, which has an inner bore <b>25</b>, with contact elements <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> corresponding to the contact elements <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> being arranged on the inner surface of said inner bore <b>25</b>, is located within the housing <b>11</b>. The mid-axis of the inner bore <b>25</b> is aligned with the mid-axis of the contact bolt <b>20</b> and with the mid-axis of the insulating spindle <b>23</b>. The active part <b>24</b> is connected to a partial conductor piece <b>28</b>, which forms a current path, for example to an outgoer module, in accordance with the arrow direction P<sub>1</sub>. A limb <b>29</b> of an L-shaped connecting conductor <b>30</b> is located between the active part <b>24</b> and the partial conductor piece <b>28</b>, the other limb of said connecting conductor running perpendicular to the first limb <b>29</b> and parallel to the flange plane of the flange <b>12</b> and parallel to the plane in which the lines of movement of the contact bolts lie. The limb <b>31</b> adjoins a partial conductor piece <b>32</b>, which is connected to a transformer module <b>33</b>, for example, which is fastened on the flange <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A further transformer module <b>34</b>, for example, is fastened on the flange <b>13</b> and is connected to the carrier or first active part <b>18</b> via an extension part <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A first bevel wheel <b>36</b> of a bevel gear <b>37</b> is fastened at that end of the insulating spindle <b>23</b> which is remote from the contact bolt <b>20</b> and meshes with a second bevel wheel <b>38</b>, which is fastened on a drive spindle <b>39</b>, which lies in the plane in which the lines of movement of the contact bolts <b>20</b> lie, wherein the drive spindle <b>39</b> runs perpendicular to the insulating spindles <b>23</b> and perpendicular to the mid-axis of the contact bolts <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a longitudinal sectional view through the combined switch disconnector and earthing switch shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in accordance with an exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a longitudinal sectional view through the housing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with the insulating spindle <b>23</b> for each phase. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the switch disconnector and earthing switch is a three-phase switch. In an exemplary embodiment disclosed herein, the switch disconnector could also be in the form of a two-phase switch, with a single-phase configuration naturally also being conceivable. The arrangement of the contact bolts <b>20</b> and the insulating spindles <b>23</b> with the earthing contact piece <b>42</b> in one plane would only be expedient in a two-phase or three-phase embodiment, however.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The bevel gear is accommodated in the interior <b>40</b> of an earthing contact piece <b>42</b>, which earthing contact piece <b>42</b> is fastened on the inner side of the housing <b>11</b> via a projection <b>43</b>. The earthing contact piece <b>42</b> has a contact-making element <b>44</b>, which has an inner bore <b>45</b>, in which contact elements <b>46</b> and <b>47</b> corresponding to the contact elements <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>; <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> are accommodated.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The contact bolt <b>20</b> for each phase is located within the first active part <b>18</b>, wherein the end faces lie or are located within the end faces of the active part. In order for it to be possible for contact to be made between the contact bolt and the second active part <b>24</b>, the drive spindle <b>39</b> is set in rotation via an electric motor <b>48</b>, with the result that the insulating spindle <b>23</b> is set in rotation via the bevel gear <b>37</b>, with the result that the contact bolt <b>20</b>, on rotation in one direction, is driven into the second active part <b>24</b> and thus connects the outgoer P<sub>1 </sub>to the current transformer <b>34</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a further mode of operation, when the drive spindle <b>39</b> is rotating in the opposite direction, the contact bolt <b>20</b> moves in the direction opposite to the arrow direction P<sub>1</sub>, with the result that the contact bolt can enter the inner bore <b>45</b> of the earthing contact piece <b>42</b>/<b>43</b> with the end face of said contact bolt, which is on the left in the drawing, with the result that earthing is thus provided.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Instead of fastening the earthing contact piece <b>42</b> directly to the inner side of the housing, it is also possible for it to be fastened via a measuring connection device, which is not shown here, however. The combined switch disconnector and earthing switch <b>10</b> is flange-connected directly to the circuit breaker housing, in one configuration in a switchgear assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the present invention can be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The presently disclosed embodiments are therefore considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restricted. The scope of the invention is indicated by the appended claims rather than the foregoing description and all changes that come within the meaning and range and equivalence thereof are intended to be embraced therein.</p>
