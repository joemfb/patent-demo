<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional of U. S. patent application Ser. No. 11/742,008, filed Apr. 30, 2007, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Well treatments, such as well reservoir hydraulic fracturing, can be used to increase the connectivity between a surrounding reservoir and a wellbore. Various systems and methods are used to conduct fracturing jobs that can increase the flow of a desired fluid into a wellbore.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, hydraulic fracturing fluid can be pumped down a well casing or through &#x201c;frac&#x201d; tubulars installed during a fracturing job. The latter tubulars are installed if the well casing has a pressure rating lower than the anticipated fracturing job pumping pressure. Because the fracturing tubulars are much smaller in diameter than the well casing, however, job friction pressure power losses can be substantial, e.g. over 75% of the total surface pumping power. Pumping the fracturing fluid directly down the well casing also can be problematic due to limits on the pressure, for example, that can be applied within the well casing or fracturing of open zones above the target zones.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, the present invention provides a system and method in which an electric submersible pumping system is used to facilitate a well treatment, such as a hydraulic fracturing well treatment. The electric submersible pumping system is positioned downhole and oriented to intake a fluid delivered downhole for use in the well treatment. When the fluid is delivered downhole, the electric submersible pumping system pumps, pressurizes and discharges this fluid in a manner that facilitates the well treatment, e.g. the hydraulic fracturing treatment. The pumping system reduces the pressure at which the treatment fluid must be delivered downhole.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the following description, numerous details are set forth to provide an understanding of the present invention. However, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these details and that numerous variations or modifications from the described embodiments may be possible.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention relates to a system and methodology for utilizing an electric submersible pumping system in a well treatment operation. For example, the electric submersible pumping system can be used to facilitate well reservoir hydraulic fracturing. The pumping system is placed downhole and used to increase the pressure of the fracturing fluid at the downhole location. This approach reduces pumping friction losses otherwise associated with conventional fracturing systems in which fracturing fluid is pumped downhole and pressurized from a surface location. Use of the electric submersible pumping system within a wellbore also can improve other aspects of well treatment operations. For example, operation of the electric submersible pumping system can be controlled to provide cyclic fracturing pressure waves. Additionally, incorporation of an electric submersible pumping system into a fracturing system can facilitate zone-by-zone fracturing as well as open-hole well fracturing.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, an electric submersible pumping system is deployed on coiled tubing into a wellbore to conduct a well treatment, e.g. a fracturing treatment. When the fracturing treatment is performed, fracturing fluid is pumped down the wellbore to an intake of the electric submersible pumping system. The pumping system intakes the fracturing fluid and discharges the fluid to stimulate the open well zone. Pressure gauges can be used to provide accurate pressure measurements, e.g. real-time pressure measurements, during the fracturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The electric submersible pumping system effectively &#x201c;boosts&#x201d; the pressure of the fracturing fluid. Accordingly, the system and methodology described herein significantly reduce the pressure otherwise applied to the well casing or other tubulars during a hydraulic fracturing treatment or other well treatment utilizing pressurized fluid. By increasing pressure downhole with the electric submersible pumping system, only tubular friction pressure is required at the surface because the downhole pumping system is able to boost the pressure of the fluid to a level desired for optimal performance of the fracturing or other well treatment operation.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">One embodiment of a well treatment system <b>10</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In this embodiment, well treatment system <b>10</b> is used to perform a hydraulic fracturing job at a desired well zone <b>12</b> within the surrounding reservoir or formation <b>14</b>. A wellbore <b>16</b> is drilled into or through formation <b>14</b> and is often lined with a well casing <b>18</b>. However, well treatment system <b>10</b> also can be used in a variety of open-hole applications.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the embodiment illustrated, an electric submersible pumping system <b>20</b> is deployed in the well at a desired well zone, e.g. well zone <b>12</b>, by moving the electric submersible pumping system <b>20</b> downhole through wellbore <b>16</b>. Electric submersible pumping system <b>20</b> may comprise various components arranged in a variety of configurations. For example, electric submersible pumping system may comprise a submersible motor <b>22</b> positioned to drive a submersible pump <b>24</b>, such as a centrifugal pump. The pumping system also may comprise other components, such as a motor protector <b>26</b>, a pump intake <b>28</b>, and a pump discharge <b>30</b>. A fluid <b>32</b>, e.g. a fracturing fluid, is delivered downhole along wellbore <b>16</b> to pump intake <b>28</b>. Operation of submersible pump <b>24</b> draws the fluid <b>32</b> through pump intake <b>28</b> and into submersible pump <b>24</b> from which the fluid is discharged through pump discharge <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The electric submersible pumping system <b>20</b> is deployed downhole on a suitable conveyance <b>34</b>. In the embodiment illustrated, conveyance <b>34</b> comprises coiled tubing and fluid <b>32</b> comprises fracturing fluid delivered downhole along the exterior of conveyance <b>34</b>, e.g. along an annulus between coiled tubing <b>34</b> and surrounding casing <b>18</b>, as indicated by arrows <b>36</b>. A power cable <b>38</b> also may be routed along conveyance <b>34</b> to deliver electrical power to motor <b>22</b> for powering submersible pump <b>24</b>. The electrical power may be controlled by an appropriate control system, such as a surface variable speed drive <b>40</b> located at a surface <b>42</b> of the well. Variable speed drive <b>40</b> can be used to vary the speed of the electric submersible pumping system <b>20</b> and thus vary the pressure wave resulting from the fluid discharged by electric submersible pumping system <b>20</b>. Varying the pressure wave can enhance injectivity and facilitate mapping of the evolving fracture geometry.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a packer <b>44</b> is positioned around electric submersible pumping system <b>20</b> intermediate pump intake <b>28</b> and pump discharge <b>30</b>. Packer <b>44</b> is designed to seal off a desired zone, such as well zone <b>12</b>, so the well treatment operation can be conducted in that zone. For example, packer <b>44</b> can be used to seal off well zone <b>12</b> while fracturing fluid <b>32</b> is discharged from the electric submersible pumping system <b>20</b> and injected into the surrounding formation as indicated by arrows <b>46</b>. By way of example, packer <b>44</b> may be a packer designed to enable repetitive setting and unsetting within the wellbore, e.g. an inflatable packer. In this latter embodiment, fluid can be pumped down coiled tubing <b>34</b> to selectively set the packer <b>44</b> at desired locations within wellbore <b>16</b>. The ability to set and unset packer <b>44</b> allows well treatment operations to be conducted at a plurality of well zones, e.g. sequential well zones.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The fracturing treatment is carried out by initially introducing fluid <b>32</b> into wellbore <b>16</b> by an appropriate fracturing fluid pumping system <b>48</b> located at surface <b>42</b>. The fracturing fluid is delivered downhole along a desired flow path, such as the annulus formed between coiled tubing <b>34</b> and the surrounding wellbore wall, e.g. casing <b>18</b>. The fracturing fluid <b>32</b> is intaken through pump intake <b>28</b> at a location uphole from packer <b>44</b> and pumped via submersible pump <b>24</b> until it is discharged through pump discharge <b>30</b> positioned at a location downhole from packer <b>44</b>. The fluid <b>32</b> is discharged into well zone <b>12</b> at a substantially increased pressure to provide the appropriate fracturing treatment. A secondary sealing mechanism <b>50</b> can be positioned downhole of well zone <b>12</b> to isolate well zone <b>12</b> between packer <b>44</b> and secondary sealing mechanism <b>50</b>. A variety of mechanisms can be used to form the secondary sealing mechanism <b>50</b>, including a sand plug <b>52</b> formed by dumping sand down the wellbore annulus before setting packer <b>44</b>. For example, sand plug <b>52</b> can be used to cover a first treated well zone when electric submersible pumping system <b>20</b> and packer <b>44</b> are moved to a subsequent well zone for treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Well treatment system <b>10</b> also may comprise one or more sensors <b>54</b> used to detect and monitor a variety of conditions during the well treatment operation. By way of example, a sensor <b>54</b> may be a pressure sensor located below packer <b>44</b> to measure fracturing pressures. Another sensor <b>54</b> may be positioned above packer <b>44</b> to measure, for example, pressure of the fracturing fluid proximate pump intake <b>28</b>. The sensors <b>54</b> can provide real-time data to an operator conducting the well treatment operation. Data from sensors <b>54</b> can be transmitted to the surface by a variety of transmission techniques, including via encoding on the electric submersible pumping system power cable <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, well treatment system <b>10</b> also may comprise a perforation assembly <b>56</b> having a perforating gun <b>58</b> to form perforations through casing <b>18</b>. In the embodiment illustrated, perforation assembly <b>56</b> is coupled to electric submersible pumping system <b>20</b> at a position below the pumping system. The perforation assembly <b>56</b> can be used to perforate an individual zone or multiple well zones. Furthermore, perforation assembly <b>56</b> can be used to perforate a plurality of well zones prior to conducting any well treatment operations. However, in an alternate embodiment, the perforation assembly <b>56</b> can be used to perforate each well zone when the electric submersible pumping system <b>20</b> is moved to that specific well zone to conduct a well treatment operation.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">One example of a methodology for conducting zone-by-zone fracturing is illustrated by the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In this embodiment, a perforation assembly is initially used to perforate all well zones and then a scraper run is conducted to prepare casing <b>18</b>, as illustrated by block <b>60</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The electric submersible pumping system <b>20</b> is then run-in-hole to, for example, the lowest well zone, as illustrated by block <b>62</b>. Packer <b>44</b> is then set as indicated in block <b>64</b>, and the setting can be accomplished by pumping fluid down through coiled tubing <b>34</b>. Once packer <b>44</b> is set, fracturing fluid <b>32</b> is delivered downhole to pump intake <b>28</b>, and submersible pump <b>24</b> pressurizes the fracturing fluid and discharges the fracturing fluid to fracture the first well zone, as indicated by block <b>66</b>. At this stage, treatment of the first well zone is completed and electric submersible pumping system <b>20</b> is ready for movement to the next well zone that is to be treated, e.g. fractured.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The packer <b>44</b> is then unset from the surrounding casing <b>18</b>, as indicated by block <b>68</b>. While packer <b>44</b> is released, electric submersible pumping system <b>20</b> is moved to a second well zone to treat the second well zone, as indicated by block <b>70</b>. Before resetting packer <b>44</b>, the previous treated zone is isolated by an appropriate isolation mechanism, such as sand plug <b>52</b>, as illustrated by block <b>72</b>. Packer <b>44</b> is then reset and the next sequential well zone is treated, e.g. fractured, as indicated by block <b>74</b>. This process can be repeated for any subsequent well zones, as indicated by block <b>76</b>. In an alternate embodiment, perforating gun <b>58</b> is disposed at the bottom of the electric submersible pumping system <b>20</b> and is used to perforate each well zone before fracturing so there are no open zones exposed to the annular fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An alternate well zone treatment system is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In this embodiment, electric submersible pumping system <b>20</b> discharges a fluid, through at least one jetting nozzle <b>80</b> and often through a plurality of jetting nozzles <b>80</b>. Fracturing slurry is pumped down the annulus as indicated by arrow <b>78</b>. A portion of the fluid is drawn into the electrical pump <b>24</b> and discharged as a fluid jet from nozzle <b>80</b>. The fluid jet initiates a fracture, for example in open hole, and diverts most of the annulur fracturing slurry <b>78</b> into the into the desired zone by transfer of fluid momentum. This arrangement can be used to deliver substantially more fluid and increased fluid power to the initiation and diverting jetting nozzles than current methods because the jetted fluid from nozzle <b>80</b> is not transported from surface through a tubing string. The improved jet power provides a deeper initiation cavity and improved diversion of the annular fracturing fluid from adjacent zones. The system and methodology described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also enables the provision of high fluid power to a jetting nozzle <b>80</b> without the typical limitations resulting from tubular friction pressure losses.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring again to some embodiments also may comprise many other components. For example, pressure sensors <b>54</b> can be located above and/or below a packer <b>44</b>, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, so fracturing pressures can be known accurately in real-time. The pressure signals are transmitted to, for example, the surface via encoding on the power cable <b>38</b> or by other suitable transmission techniques. The embodiment also enables the formation of cavities without utilizing a packer, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Depending on the treatment application, the downhole electric submersible pumping system <b>20</b> can be constructed in a variety of configurations to facilitate a variety of well treatment operations.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The overall well treatment system <b>10</b> or the electric submersible pumping system <b>20</b> can be constructed in a variety of configurations utilizing additional or different components than those illustrated to enable performance of a desired well treatment. For example, pressure sensors <b>54</b> can be located above and/or below a packer <b>44</b>, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, so fracturing pressures can be known accurately in real-time. The pressure signals are transmitted to, for example, the surface via encoding on the power cable <b>38</b> or by other suitable transmission techniques. Additionally, the well treatment fluid may comprise fracturing fluid or other types of fluid suitable for a specific, desired well treatment. The system and methodology can be used for treating individual or multiple zones along a given well. Also, the volume of fluid discharged, the pressure at which the fluid is discharged, and variations in the pressure of the fluid discharged can be adjusted by selecting submersible pumping system components, e.g. selecting alternate or additional pumps and/or motors, or by controlling the operation, e.g. the speed of rotation, of the pumping system used for the well treatment operation.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Accordingly, although only a few embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail above, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible without materially departing from the teachings of this invention. Accordingly, such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined in the claims.</p>
