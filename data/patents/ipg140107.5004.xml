<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A wireless electronic device may contain multiple antennas. Control circuitry in the wireless electronic device may adjust antenna switching circuitry so that the device repeatedly cycles through use of each of the antennas. In a device with first and second antennas, the device may repeatedly toggle between the first and second antennas. During each toggling cycle time period, the first antenna may transmit for a fraction of the time period and the second antenna may transmit for a fraction of the time period. The wireless device may control the average power emitted by each antenna by adjusting the fractions of time assigned to each antenna. By performing antenna toggling, the average transmit power produced by each antenna may be reduced while maintaining the average transmit power produced by the device at a desired level.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to electronic devices, and more particularly, to wireless electronic devices that have two or more antennas.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Electronic devices such as handheld electronic devices and other portable electronic devices are becoming increasingly popular. Examples of handheld devices include handheld computers, cellular telephones, media players, and hybrid devices that include the functionality of multiple devices of this type. Popular portable electronic devices that are somewhat larger than traditional handheld electronic devices include laptop computers and tablet computers.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Due in part to their mobile nature, portable electronic devices are often provided with wireless communications capabilities. For example, portable electronic devices may use long-range wireless communications to communicate with wireless base stations and may use short-range wireless communications links such as links for supporting the Wi-Fi&#xae; (IEEE 802.11) bands at 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz and the Bluetooth&#xae; band at 2.4 GHz.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To satisfy consumer demand for small form factor wireless devices, manufacturers are continually striving to reduce the size of components that are used in these devices while providing enhanced functionality. It is generally impractical to completely shield a user of a portable device from transmitted radio-frequency signals. For example, conventional cellular telephone handsets generally emit signals in the vicinity of a user's head during telephone calls. Government regulations limit radio-frequency signal powers. In particular, so-called specific absorption rate (SAR) standards are in place that impose maximum energy absorption limits on handset manufacturers. At the same time, wireless carriers require that the handsets that are used in their networks be capable of producing certain minimum radio-frequency power levels so as to ensure satisfactory operation of the handsets.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The manufacturers of portable wireless electronic devices therefore face challenges in producing devices with adequate wireless performance that are compliant with applicable government regulations.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It would therefore be desirable to be able to provide electronic devices with improved wireless communications capabilities.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A wireless electronic device may be subject to maximum energy absorption limits that restrict the maximum wireless transmit powers of the device. The wireless electronic device may have two or more antennas. The wireless electronic device may perform periodic antenna switching operations to provide increased energy absorption safety margins and increased performance.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, in a wireless device with a first antenna at one end of the device and a second antenna at an opposing end of the device, the device may repeatedly cycle between a first configuration in which a first antenna is active and a second configuration in which a second antenna is active. During each time period in this switching cycle, the first antenna may be active for a first fraction of the time period and the second antenna may be active for a second fraction of the time period. By toggling between antennas in this way, the amount of power emitted for each antenna may be reduced to help provide additional safety margin while satisfying performance criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">By adjusting the fractions of time that the first and second antennas are active for each cycle time period while toggling between the first and second antennas, the wireless device may control the time-averaged power emitted by each antenna and distribute radio-frequency power more evenly in space. The antenna toggling process may therefore reduce the concentration of wireless emissions produced by each antenna while maintaining a desired overall emitted power level.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further features of the present invention, its nature and various advantages will be more apparent from the accompanying drawings and the following detailed description.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention relates generally to wireless communications, and more particularly, to wireless electronic devices that perform antenna toggling when transmitting radio-frequency signals.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The wireless electronic devices may be portable electronic devices such as laptop computers or small portable computers of the type that are sometimes referred to as ultraportables. Portable electronic devices may include tablet computing devices (e.g., a portable computer that includes a touch-screen display). Portable electronic devices may also be somewhat smaller devices. Examples of smaller portable electronic devices include wrist-watch devices, pendant devices, headphone and earpiece devices, and other wearable and miniature devices. With one suitable arrangement, the portable electronic devices may be handheld electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The wireless electronic devices may be, for example, cellular telephones, media players with wireless communications capabilities, handheld computers (also sometimes called personal digital assistants), remote controllers, global positioning system (GPS) devices, tablet computers, and handheld gaming devices. The wireless electronic devices may also be hybrid devices that combine the functionality of multiple conventional devices. Examples of hybrid portable electronic devices include a cellular telephone that includes media player functionality, a gaming device that includes a wireless communications capability, a cellular telephone that includes game and email functions, and a portable device that receives email, supports mobile telephone calls, has music player functionality and supports web browsing. These are merely illustrative examples.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Device <b>10</b> may have housing <b>12</b>. Antennas for handling wireless communications may be housed within housing <b>12</b> (as an example).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Housing <b>12</b>, which is sometimes referred to as a case, may be formed of any suitable materials including, plastic, glass, ceramics, metal, or other suitable materials, or a combination of these materials. In some situations, housing <b>12</b> or portions of housing <b>12</b> may be formed from a dielectric or other low-conductivity material, so that the operation of conductive antenna elements that are located in proximity to housing <b>12</b> is not disrupted. Housing <b>12</b> or portions of housing <b>12</b> may also be formed from conductive materials such as metal. An illustrative housing material that may be used is anodized aluminum. Aluminum is relatively light in weight and, when anodized, has an attractive insulating and scratch-resistant surface. If desired, other metals can be used for the housing of device <b>10</b>, such as stainless steel, magnesium, titanium, alloys of these metals and other metals, etc. In scenarios in which housing <b>12</b> is formed from metal elements, one or more of the metal elements may be used as part of the antennas in device <b>10</b>. For example, metal portions of housing <b>12</b> may be shorted to an internal ground plane in device <b>10</b> to create a larger ground plane element for that device <b>10</b>. To facilitate electrical contact between an anodized aluminum housing and other metal components in device <b>10</b>, portions of the anodized surface layer of the anodized aluminum housing may be selectively removed during the manufacturing process (e.g., by laser etching).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Housing <b>12</b> may have a bezel <b>14</b>. The bezel <b>14</b> may be formed from a conductive material and may serve to hold a display or other device with a planar surface in place on device <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, bezel <b>14</b> may be used to hold display <b>16</b> in place by attaching display <b>16</b> to housing <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Display <b>16</b> may be a liquid crystal diode (LCD) display, an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display, or any other suitable display. The outermost surface of display <b>16</b> may be formed from one or more plastic or glass layers. If desired, touch screen functionality may be integrated into display <b>16</b> or may be provided using a separate touch pad device. An advantage of integrating a touch screen into display <b>16</b> to make display <b>16</b> touch sensitive is that this type of arrangement can save space and reduce visual clutter.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Display screen <b>16</b> (e.g., a touch screen) is merely one example of an input-output device that may be used with electronic device <b>10</b>. If desired, electronic device <b>10</b> may have other input-output devices. For example, electronic device <b>10</b> may have user input control devices such as button <b>19</b>, and input-output components such as port <b>20</b> and one or more input-output jacks (e.g., for audio and/or video). Button <b>19</b> may be, for example, a menu button. Port <b>20</b> may contain a 30-pin data connector (as an example). Openings <b>24</b> and <b>22</b> may, if desired, form microphone and speaker ports. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, display screen <b>16</b> is shown as being mounted on the front face of portable electronic device <b>10</b>, but display screen <b>16</b> may, if desired, be mounted on the rear face of portable electronic device <b>10</b>, on a side of device <b>10</b>, on a flip-up portion of device <b>10</b> that is attached to a main body portion of device <b>10</b> by a hinge (for example), or using any other suitable mounting arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">If desired, device <b>10</b> may include sensors such as proximity sensors, accelerometers, or other sensors. The sensors may be built into housing <b>12</b> or formed in other locations in device <b>10</b>. For example, display <b>16</b> may be a touch screen display that detects when a head of a user is in contact with the touch screen display (e.g., when the user is making a phone call). Device <b>10</b> may include capacitive proximity sensors, light source based proximity sensors, touch sensors, radio-frequency based proximity sensors, or any other desirable proximity sensor. Device <b>10</b> may use the sensors to identify the positioning of device <b>10</b> relative to nearby objects. For example, device <b>10</b> may use the proximity sensor to identify that device <b>10</b> is near an object such as a head or a hand of a user. Device <b>10</b> may use multiple sensors to provide more accurate information about the positioning of the device. As an example, device <b>10</b> may use a first proximity sensor to identify that the device is held near a head of a user, may use a second proximity sensor to identify that the device is being held by a hand, and may use an accelerometer to identify that the device is being held at an angle.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A user of electronic device <b>10</b> may supply input commands using user input interface devices such as button <b>19</b> and touch screen <b>16</b>.

Although shown schematically as being formed on the top face of electronic device <b>10</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, buttons such as button <b>19</b> and other user input interface devices may generally be formed on any suitable portion of electronic device <b>10</b>. For example, a button such as button <b>19</b> or other user interface control may be formed on the side of electronic device <b>10</b>. Buttons and other user interface controls can also be located on the top face, rear face, or other portion of device <b>10</b>. If desired, device <b>10</b> can be controlled remotely (e.g., using an infrared remote control, a radio-frequency remote control such as a Bluetooth remote control, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Electronic device <b>10</b> may have ports such as port <b>20</b>. Port <b>20</b>, which may sometimes be referred to as a dock connector, 30-pin data port connector, input-output port, or bus connector, may be used as an input-output port (e.g., when connecting device <b>10</b> to a mating dock connected to a computer or other electronic device). Device <b>10</b> may also have audio and video jacks that allow device <b>10</b> to interface with external components. Typical ports include power jacks to recharge a battery within device <b>10</b> or to operate device <b>10</b> from a direct current (DC) power supply, data ports to exchange data with external components such as a personal computer or peripheral, audio-visual jacks to drive headphones, a monitor, or other external audio-video equipment, a subscriber identity module (SIM) card port to authorize cellular telephone service, a memory card slot, etc. The functions of some or all of these devices and the internal circuitry of electronic device <b>10</b> can be controlled using input interface devices such as touch screen display <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Components such as display <b>16</b> and other user input interface devices may cover most of the available surface area on the front face of device <b>10</b> (as shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or may occupy only a small portion of the front face of device <b>10</b>. Because electronic components such as display <b>16</b> often contain large amounts of metal (e.g., as radio-frequency shielding), the location of these components relative to the antenna elements in device <b>10</b> should generally be taken into consideration. Suitably chosen locations for the antenna elements and electronic components of the device will allow the antennas of electronic device <b>10</b> to function properly without being disrupted by the electronic components.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Examples of locations in which antenna structures may be located in device <b>10</b> include region <b>18</b> (e.g., a first antenna) and region <b>21</b> (e.g., a second antenna).

Communications protocols that may be implemented using processing circuitry <b>36</b> and storage <b>34</b> include internet protocols, wireless local area network protocols (e.g., IEEE 802.11 protocols&#x2014;sometimes referred to as Wi-Fi&#xae;), protocols for other short-range wireless communications links such as the Bluetooth&#xae; protocol, protocols for handling 3G data services such as UMTS, cellular telephone communications protocols, protocols for handling 4G data services such as LTE, etc.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Input-output devices <b>38</b> can include user input-output devices <b>40</b> such as buttons, touch screens, joysticks, click wheels, scrolling wheels, touch pads, key pads, keyboards, microphones, cameras, etc. A user can control the operation of device <b>10</b> by supplying commands through user input devices <b>40</b>. Display and audio devices <b>42</b> may include liquid-crystal display (LCD) screens or other screens, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and other components that present visual information and status data. Display and audio devices <b>42</b> may also include audio equipment such as speakers and other devices for creating sound.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Wireless network <b>49</b> may include any suitable network equipment, such as cellular telephone base stations, cellular towers, wireless data networks, computers associated with wireless networks, etc. For example, wireless network <b>49</b> may include network management equipment that monitors the wireless signal strength of the wireless handsets (cellular telephones, handheld computing devices, etc.) that are in communication with network <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">To improve the overall performance of the network and to ensure that interference between handsets is minimized, the network management equipment may send power adjustment commands (sometimes referred to as transmit power control commands) to each handset. The transmit power control settings that are provided to the handsets direct handsets with weak signals to increase their transmit powers, so that their signals will be properly received by the network. At the same time, the transmit power control settings may instruct handsets whose signals are being received clearly at high power to reduce their transmit power control settings. This reduces interference between handsets and allows the network to maximize its use of available wireless bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The antenna structures and wireless communications devices of device <b>10</b> may support communications over any suitable wireless communications bands. For example, wireless communications devices <b>44</b> may be used to cover communications frequency bands such as cellular telephone voice and data bands at 850 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 1900 MHz, and the communications band data at 2170 MHz band (commonly referred to as a UMTS or Universal Mobile Telecommunications System band), the Wi-Fi&#xae; (IEEE 802.11) bands at 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz (also sometimes referred to as wireless local area network or WLAN bands), the Bluetooth&#xae; band at 2.4 GHz, and the global positioning system (GPS) band at 1550 MHz. If desired, wireless communications devices <b>44</b> may also be used to cover the Long Term Evolution (LTE) uplink and downlink communications frequency bands.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Device <b>10</b> can cover these communications bands and/or other suitable communications bands with proper configuration of the antenna structures in wireless communications circuitry <b>44</b>. Any suitable antenna structures may be used in device <b>10</b>. For example, device <b>10</b> may have multiple antennas. The antennas in device <b>10</b> may each be used to cover a single communications band or each antenna may cover multiple communications bands. If desired, one or more antennas may cover a single band while one or more additional antennas are each used to cover multiple bands. These are merely illustrative arrangements. Any suitable antenna structures may be used in device <b>10</b> if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A wireless device such as device <b>10</b> may be operated in scenarios in which restrictions are imposed on the radio-frequency power emitted by the device. Device <b>10</b> that communicates with a cellular base station may be required to meet specific absorption rate (SAR) requirements (e.g., due to government regulations). The SAR requirements may impose limits on the amount of power that is emitted from device <b>10</b> and absorbed by a nearby object. For example, government regulations may require that less than 2 Watts per Kilogram is absorbed from device <b>10</b> by a nearby object.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As an example, device <b>10</b> may communicate with a base station that directs the device to increase or decrease transmit power levels (e.g., to maintain acceptable levels of radio-frequency signals received at the base station). In this scenario, the base station may identify that radio-frequency signals received from the device are relatively poor (e.g., because the device is too far away from the base station or because there are interfering radio-frequency signals from other devices). The base station may direct device <b>10</b> to increase transmit powers so that signal quality at the base station is improved. However, increased transmit power levels may emit concentrations of radio-frequency power that exceed acceptable levels. Device <b>10</b> may be unable to comply with the instructions from the base station (e.g., because of government regulations) and wireless communications between the device and the base station may be disrupted (e.g., because wireless transmissions produced by device <b>10</b> may have insufficient power to reach the base station).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">To increase radio-frequency transmit power levels and reduce the concentration of radiated energy from the device, device <b>10</b> may perform antenna toggling. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an illustrative scenario in which a device <b>10</b> located near an object <b>202</b> may perform antenna toggling. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, device <b>10</b> may have a first antenna ANT<b>1</b> and a second antenna ANT<b>2</b>. Device <b>10</b> may be subject to energy absorption limits such as specific absorption ratio (SAR) requirements that limit the amount of power that is allowed to be absorbed by any given portion of object <b>202</b>. As an example, SAR requirements may limit the maximum amount of radio-frequency power absorbed by any given portion of object <b>202</b> from device <b>10</b> to 1.6 Watts per kilogram.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Device <b>10</b> may toggle between antennas ANT<b>1</b> and ANT<b>2</b> by repeatedly cycling between antennas ANT<b>1</b> and ANT<b>2</b> (e.g., using switching circuitry). Region <b>208</b> of object <b>202</b> may absorb most of the radio-frequency signals transmitted by antenna ANT<b>1</b> and region <b>210</b> of object <b>202</b> may absorb most of the radio-frequency signals transmitted by antenna ANT<b>2</b>. By toggling between antennas ANT<b>1</b> and ANT<b>2</b>, the average power absorbed by object <b>202</b> from device <b>10</b> may be distributed over an increased area (e.g., the combined area of regions <b>208</b> and <b>210</b>). Therefore the average power absorbed by any given region of object <b>202</b> may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the scenario of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the energy emitted into portion <b>208</b> by antenna ANT<b>1</b> may be substantially equal to the energy emitted into portion <b>210</b> by antenna ANT<b>2</b> (e.g., because the distance between portion <b>208</b> and antenna ANT<b>1</b> may be the same as the distance between portion <b>210</b> and antenna ANT<b>2</b>). To minimize the power absorbed by portion <b>208</b> and portion <b>210</b>, it may be desirable for device <b>10</b> to toggle equally between antennas ANT<b>1</b> and ANT<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Antenna toggling may be performed based on repeating cycles. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, device <b>10</b> may divide radio-frequency transmissions into toggling cycle time periods <b>212</b> that each correspond to a transmission time t. As an example, time t may correspond to the time required to transmit a given number of data packets. Each toggling cycle time period <b>212</b> may be partitioned into a first fraction (portion) transmitted by antenna ANT<b>1</b> and a second fraction transmitted by antenna ANT<b>2</b> (e.g., antenna ANT<b>1</b> may transmit during time t<b>1</b> of each toggling cycle time period, antenna ANT<b>2</b> may transmit during time t<b>2</b> of each toggling cycle time period, and time t may be the sum of times t<b>1</b> and t<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The proportions of times t<b>1</b> and t<b>2</b> relative to toggling cycle time period t may be selected to maximize a radio-frequency transmission power of device <b>10</b> while ensuring sufficient energy absorption safety margins (e.g., ensuring that SAR levels remain below a maximum allowable SAR level specified by government regulations). Times t<b>1</b> and t<b>2</b> may be selected based on antenna characteristics (e.g., antenna efficiency), the positioning of device <b>10</b> relative to objects such as objects <b>202</b> that are subject to specific absorption rate requirements, or the strength of signals received at each antenna from a base station (as examples). In a scenario such as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in which the time-averaged power emitted by antennas ANT<b>1</b> and ANT<b>2</b> are equally absorbed by object <b>202</b>, times t<b>1</b> and t<b>2</b> may be assigned the same value (e.g., to equally partition radio-frequency signals between antennas ANT<b>1</b> and ANT<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Antenna toggling may be adjusted based on the position of device <b>10</b> relative to object <b>202</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an illustrative example of a device <b>10</b> positioned relative to object <b>202</b> such that radio-frequency transmissions from antenna ANT<b>1</b> have a greater effect on object <b>202</b> than radio-frequency transmissions from antenna ANT<b>2</b> (e.g., because antenna ANT<b>2</b> may be further away from object <b>202</b> than antenna ANT<b>1</b>). In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, radio-frequency signals <b>256</b> from antenna ANT<b>2</b> may be mostly absorbed by object portion <b>260</b> and radio-frequency signals <b>254</b> from antenna ANT<b>1</b> may be mostly absorbed by object portion <b>258</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">To decrease the amount of radio-frequency power absorbed by object <b>202</b>, device <b>10</b> may increase the fraction of each toggling cycle time period that is assigned to antenna ANT<b>2</b> and decrease the fraction of each toggling cycle time period that is assigned to antenna ANT<b>1</b> (e.g., because object <b>202</b> absorbs less of the radio-frequency signals from antenna ANT<b>2</b> than the radio-frequency signals from antenna ANT<b>1</b>). In this way, the safety of device <b>10</b> may be improved while maintaining transmission power levels of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows how antenna toggling may be performed by wireless device <b>10</b> in a scenario such as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, each toggling cycle time period of a radio-frequency transmission may be partitioned into a first fraction (portion) transmitted by antenna ANT<b>1</b> over time t<b>3</b> and a second fraction transmitted by antenna ANT<b>2</b> over time t<b>4</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the proportion of each toggling cycle time period assigned to antenna ANT<b>1</b> may be smaller than the proportion of each toggling cycle time period assigned to antenna ANT<b>2</b> (e.g., t<b>3</b> may be less than t<b>4</b>). In this way, the average power transmitted by each antenna may be reduced (e.g., because each antenna transmits for only a fraction of each toggling cycle time period) while maintaining the average power transmitted by device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref> showing antenna toggling between two antennas are merely illustrative. If desired, radio-frequency transmissions may be partitioned between any suitable number of antennas. For example, a wireless device <b>10</b> with three antennas may partition radio-frequency transmissions between the three antennas to provide improved performance and to reduce radio-frequency emissions of each antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The positioning of device <b>10</b> relative to object <b>202</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref> are merely illustrative. Device <b>10</b> may be located in many different positions (e.g., next to the head of a user, on a user's lap, in a user's pocket, in a user's hand, etc.). For each scenario, device <b>10</b> may adjust the fractions of each toggling cycle time period assigned to each antenna to maximize performance and ensure sufficient energy absorption safety margins.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">By reducing the average power transmitted by each antenna using antenna toggling, device <b>10</b> may provide increased performance and energy absorption safety margins. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an illustrative diagram showing how antenna toggling may decrease maximum measured SAR values for various required transmit powers. The maximum measured SAR values may correspond to the maximum power absorbed by any portion of object <b>202</b> for a given required transmit power and a given position of device <b>10</b> (e.g., the device position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The required transmit power may be provided by a cellular base station (e.g., provided by transmit power control commands that are sent from the cellular base station to device <b>10</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, line <b>312</b> may correspond to maximum measured SAR values for a conventional wireless device (e.g., a device that does not perform antenna toggling). As shown by line <b>312</b>, the maximum measured SAR values may be proportional to the required transmit power (e.g., a minimum transmit power required to communicate with a cellular base station). At transmit power TX<b>1</b>, the maximum measured SAR value for the conventional device may reach a maximum allowed SAR value (e.g., a maximum allowed SAR value determined by government regulations). At transmit powers greater than TX<b>1</b>, SAR values measured from the conventional device may exceed the maximum allowed value. To avoid violating government regulations, the conventional device may be unable to increase transmit power levels beyond TX<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A device that does not perform antenna toggling may be unable to comply with commands from a cellular base station to increase transmit powers beyond TX<b>1</b> (e.g., transmit power control commands). As an example, a cellular base station may instruct the conventional wireless device to increase transmit power to a value greater than TX<b>1</b> when the cellular base station receives a relatively weak transmitted signal from the conventional device (e.g., when the device is too far away from the cellular base station). If the wireless device is unable to increase transmit power beyond TX<b>1</b>, communication with the cellular base station may be undesirably disrupted.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A wireless device <b>10</b> that performs antenna toggling may produce maximum measured SAR values that correspond to line <b>314</b>. As shown by line <b>314</b>, the maximum measured SAR values for device <b>10</b> may be less than the maximum measured values for a conventional device for any given required transmit power. For example, measured SAR values for device <b>10</b> at transmit power TX<b>1</b> may have a maximum value V<b>1</b>. V<b>1</b> may be less than the maximum allowed SAR value and provide improved margins of safety (e.g., a device <b>10</b> that produces maximum measured SAR values of V<b>1</b> at a transmit power of TX<b>1</b> may provide improved safety margins over a conventional device that produces the maximum allowed SAR value at transmit power TX<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">By performing antenna toggling, device <b>10</b> may provide improved wireless performance.

Transceiver circuitry <b>100</b> may also include one or more radio-frequency receiver circuits such as receiver <b>104</b> (e.g., for receiving cellular telephone signals or other wireless traffic). Control circuitry <b>35</b> may provide data that is to be wirelessly transmitted to transceiver circuitry <b>100</b> via path <b>114</b>. During signal reception operations, received data may be provided to control circuitry <b>35</b> from transceiver circuitry <b>100</b> via path <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">During operation, transmitted signals from transmitter <b>102</b> may be conveyed to antennas <b>44</b>A and <b>44</b>B (e.g., antennas ANT<b>1</b> and ANT<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) via front-end circuitry <b>106</b>. Front-end circuitry <b>106</b> may also be used to convey radio-frequency signals from antennas <b>44</b>A and <b>44</b>B to receiver <b>104</b> during signal reception operations.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Front-end circuitry <b>106</b> may include filter circuitry such as duplexers and diplexers, impedance matching circuitry, switches such as switch <b>108</b>, and other radio-frequency circuitry for coupling transceiver circuitry <b>100</b> to antennas <b>44</b>A and <b>44</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Switching circuitry <b>108</b> may be controlled by control signals provided by control circuitry <b>35</b> over path <b>110</b>. The control signals may be generated by a processing circuit in control circuitry <b>35</b> (e.g., a baseband processor or a microprocessor). During operation of device <b>10</b>, the control signals on path <b>110</b> may direct switch <b>108</b> to alternate between first and second states. In the first state, antenna <b>44</b>A is switched into use and is coupled to transceiver circuitry <b>100</b> (via path <b>112</b>). In the first state, antenna <b>44</b>B is isolated from transceiver circuitry <b>100</b> and therefore is not used in transmitting or receiving signals. In the second state, antenna <b>44</b>B is switched into use in place of antenna <b>44</b>A. In the second state, signals can be transmitted through antenna <b>44</b>B using transmitter <b>102</b> and signals can be received from antenna <b>44</b>B using receiver <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">To help balance the power that is transmitted through a given antenna, control circuitry <b>35</b> may toggle antennas <b>44</b>A and <b>44</b>B. For example, control circuitry <b>35</b> may issue control signals on path <b>110</b> so that switching circuitry <b>108</b> alternates between its first configuration in which antenna <b>44</b>A is switched into use and its second configuration in which antenna <b>44</b>B is switched into use. By periodically cycling between antennas <b>44</b>A and <b>44</b>B in this way, neither antenna is used exclusively and the time-averaged power emitted from each antenna is reduced. This may help device <b>10</b> comply with regulatory limits on emitted radio-frequency power (e.g., SAR requirements).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Any suitable partitioning scheme may be used to control the fraction of time that each antenna is active. With one suitable arrangement, control circuitry <b>35</b> may be configured to switch the first antenna into use for a first fraction of a time period and may be configured to switch the second antenna into use for a second fraction of a time period. The sum of the first and second fractions of the time period may be equal to the length of the time period, so that either the first or second antenna (but not both) is active at any point in time. As described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, for example, control circuitry <b>35</b> may toggle between use of the first and second antennas with a period t. During each period t, antenna <b>44</b>A may be active for subperiod t<b>3</b> (i.e., the fraction of time that antenna <b>44</b>A is active is t<b>3</b>/t). Antenna <b>44</b>B may be active for subperiod t<b>4</b> within each period (i.e., the fraction of time that antenna <b>44</b>B is active is t<b>4</b>/t). Because t<b>3</b>+t<b>4</b> is equal to t, at least one of the two antennas will be used at any point in time.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In configurations of device <b>10</b> in which accelerometers, proximity sensors, or other sources of proximity information, orientation information, etc. are available, device <b>10</b> may control the relative amount of time that each antenna is active in real time. For example, if control circuitry <b>35</b> receives information from sensors <b>45</b> indicating that antenna <b>44</b>A is closer to an external object than antenna <b>44</b>B (or is otherwise likely to emit more signal power into the external object than antenna <b>44</b>B), control circuitry <b>35</b> may increase time period t<b>4</b> and can decrease time period t<b>3</b> by a corresponding amount. The period t may be maintained at a constant value (as an example), but the fraction of time that antenna <b>44</b>A is used may be decreased while the fraction of time that antenna <b>44</b>B is used may be increased. During operation, device <b>10</b> may therefore continually adjust the duty cycle (fraction of time in which each antenna is active) for each antenna to help distribute the localized emission of radio-frequency signal power in a way that ensures regulatory compliance.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Device <b>10</b> may continually update the optimum values of t<b>3</b> and t<b>4</b> in real time based on sensor data. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, control circuitry <b>35</b> may, at step <b>116</b>, receive sensor data from sensors <b>45</b> (e.g., accelerometer data indicating the position of device <b>10</b> and therefore a probable position relative to an external object, proximity sensor data indicating the position of device <b>10</b> relative to an external object, etc.). Based on the sensor data and other data (e.g., information on the relative efficiencies of each antenna, information on the spatial radiation-emission properties of each antenna, etc.), control circuitry <b>35</b> may, at step <b>118</b>, update the values of t<b>3</b> and t<b>4</b>. As shown by line <b>120</b>, the operations of steps <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> may be performed continually in real time, so that device <b>10</b> is continually provided with updated information on an optimal allocation between use of antenna <b>44</b>A and antenna <b>44</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Steps involved in transmitting signals from device <b>10</b> based on the settings produced during the operations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> or based on default (e.g., fixed) settings are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. During the operations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, device <b>10</b> may toggle back and forth repeatedly between antennas <b>44</b>A and <b>44</b>B, so that neither antenna is used continuously. In this way, emitted radio-frequency signals are effectively spread across both antennas and an enlarged portion of device <b>10</b>. If, for example, antenna <b>44</b>A is located at one end of device <b>10</b> whereas antenna <b>44</b>B is located at another end of device <b>10</b>, toggling between the two antennas will tend to spread the radiated power from device <b>10</b> across both ends of device <b>10</b>, rather than concentrating this power at only one end of device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Transmitter <b>102</b> may be used in transmitting signals for both antenna <b>44</b>A and antenna <b>44</b>B. Switching circuitry <b>108</b> may be toggled between its first and second configurations. During the operations of step <b>122</b>, control circuitry <b>35</b> may place switching circuitry <b>108</b> in its first configuration, so that transmitted radio-frequency signals from transmitter <b>102</b> are transmitted through first antenna <b>44</b>A. During the operations of step <b>124</b>, control circuitry <b>35</b> may place switching circuitry <b>108</b> in its second configuration, so that transmitted radio-frequency signals from transmitter <b>102</b> are transmitted through second antenna <b>44</b>B. The operations of steps <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> may each be performed once per toggling cycle time period (i.e., step <b>122</b> is performed once and step <b>124</b> is performed once per each of the complete toggling cycles indicated by line <b>124</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Each loop (cycle) through the steps <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> therefore corresponds to a separate toggling cycle time period t (i.e., the period of a complete toggling cycle that involves use of each antenna for its respective fraction of time is equal to t). The duration that the first antenna is used (step <b>122</b>) is time t<b>3</b> and the fraction of time that the first antenna is used during the toggling cycle time period is t<b>3</b>/t. The duration that the second antenna is used (step <b>124</b>) is time t<b>4</b> and the fraction of time that the second antenna is used during the toggling cycle time period is t<b>4</b>/t.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The foregoing is merely illustrative of the principles of this invention and various modifications can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.</p>
