<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a national phase entry of, and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;371 to, International Patent Application No. PCT/AU2009/000964, filed 29 Jul. 2009, entitled &#x201c;Modulator,&#x201d; which designates the United States of America, and which claims priority to Australian Patent Application No. 2008903857, filed 29 Jul. 2008, the entire content and disclosure of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a modulator for changing a constant flow of gas to a pulsed or intermittent flow of gas and has particular reference to generation of carbon dioxide or volatile lures for attracting biting or flying insects inclusive of mosquitoes.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Reference may be made to U.S. Pat. No. 6,817,140 which refers to a flying insect trapping device configured to be used with hydrocarbon gas such as propane wherein the propane is passed through a regulator device for controlling flow of gas in intermittent pulses. The flow regulator is in the form of a solenoid that is programmed by a controller to convert a continuous flow of gas to a pulsed or intermittent flow of gas. There was also provided a valve for flushing of the solenoid and a fuel delivery nozzle when required. The pulsed flow of propane was passed through a catalylic convertor device to convert the propane to carbon dioxide which was used to attract mosquitoes to the trapping device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Reference may also be made to Patent Publication WO/2005/108244 which describes a process for the catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbon gas which comprises releasing pulses of a compressed hydrocarbon gas into an expansion chamber and passing the expanding hydrocarbon gas over a catalytic convertor to oxidize the hydrocarbon gas.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The aforementioned prior art is exemplary of the fact that changing a flow of gas from a constant flow to a pulsed intermittent flow is not new.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, such prior art has no relevance to the present invention which refers to a modulator of simple construction and which is efficient in use which has particular reference to generation of a pulsed flow of carbon dioxide, although the modulator may be utilized to provide a pulsed flow of other gases.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of the invention therefore is to provide a modulator for changing a flow of gas from a constant flow to a pulsed or intermittent flow which is simple in construction and effective in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The modulator of the invention includes a housing component and an insertion tube flow of gas to a pulsed or intermittent flow of gas, said modulator including a housing component and an insertion tube for insertion into a hollow interior of the housing component wherein after insertion of the insertion tube into the housing component, gas is generated either in situ within the hollow interior of the housing component and be caused to flow out of an outlet of the modulator in pulses or alternatively gas is passed into the insertion tube in a constant flow and upon reaching the hollow interior of the housing component is released therefrom through the outlet in a pulsed flow.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The housing component is preferably a hollow tube having one closed bottom end and an open upper end in use. The housing component in one embodiment may contain an attractant medium for attracting insects which preferably generates carbon dioxide or other volatile lure for insects in situ.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, more generally the housing component may include a viscous fluid such as glycerine, a mixture of water and glycerine, honey, molasses or syrups of various kinds including maple syrup and chocolate syrup. Suitably since viscous fluid may have a viscosity of 500-30,000 cP.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The attractant medium for insertion into the housing component suitably is formed of food grade components and is responsible for causing a generation of a volatile insect lure such as a carbon dioxide for exiting the modulator in a pulsed intermittent flow as hereinafter described. Various preferred forms of attractant medium will also be described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The open end of the hollow tube may have a lid or cover releasably attached to the open end for preventing escape of the carbon dioxide or volatile lure when not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The insertion tube may also have an elongate body which preferably tapers outwardly from top to bottom in use. The insertion tube may have a bottom open end. The insertion tube may have an enlarged top end which has a plurality of ribs having spaces or gaps therebetween in flow communication with a hollow interior of the insertion tube for releasing gas from the modulator in a pulsed intermittent flow.</p>

There is also provided as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> a retaining clip <b>25</b> for engagement with gas hose <b>21</b> which has resilient fingers <b>26</b> surrounding an aperture <b>32</b> which engages with gas hose <b>21</b> in use as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows how insertion component <b>15</b> is inserted into housing component <b>11</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref> show an assembled view of insertion component <b>15</b> in housing component <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> there is shown a modulator <b>10</b> connected to gas bottle <b>22</b> wherein sleeve <b>33</b> and integral nut <b>34</b> are screw threadedly attached to a mating screw threaded bore (not shown) in gas fitting <b>35</b> of gas bottle <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">There is also provided an adjustment handle <b>36</b> for switching gas flow on/off from bottle <b>22</b> as well as nuts <b>37</b> and <b>38</b> of gas outlet fitting <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> it is noted that gas outlet fitting <b>20</b> has a hollow spigot <b>38</b>A inserted into recess <b>19</b>A of socket lug <b>19</b> and thus gas flows from gas bottle <b>22</b> through gas hose <b>21</b> to hollow bore <b>39</b> of insertion component <b>15</b> which is tubular as shown having an open lower end <b>40</b>. The gas flows through horizontal branch passage <b>42</b> to hollow bore <b>39</b> and then mixes with food grade attractant or viscous medium <b>14</b> as shown. The gas is carbon dioxide and flow through hollow bore <b>39</b> is continuous. It has been established scientifically that female mosquitoes are more attracted to intermittent plumes or pulses of CO<sub>2 </sub>rather than a continuous flow of gas since pulsing mimics the breathing pattern of mammals.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A primary function of modulator <b>10</b> is to pulse carbon dioxide for the purpose of attracting mosquitoes and other biting insects to a suitable trap shown hereinafter in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It will be appreciated that modulator <b>10</b> can operate without connection to a gas regulator hose in order to function solely as a dispenser of a particular lure or attractant blend <b>14</b>. In this capacity the modulator <b>10</b> can function as a decoy to lure insects away from areas where people gather. When used as a lure dispenser the modulator <b>10</b> can be attached to a mosquito trap or located adjacent thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The modulator <b>10</b> contains a proprietary food grade medium or a viscous fluid <b>14</b> which causes the flow of gas passing through it to pulse. This medium <b>14</b> can be varied to produce a faster or slower pulse rate and to change the volume of each release of gas.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Select food grade constituents that singly or collectively are attractants to the target insect or other life form can be added to the medium <b>14</b> in whatever proportions are required for the specific application. An amount of lure will be released along with the gas to form a gas-lure mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The use of a gas hose <b>21</b> having a ceramic insert and associated capillary passage as described in International Patent Publication WO 2009/003246 which is totally incorporated herein by reference enables micro control of the flow of gas from a pressurized cylinder <b>22</b> without the need of a conventional regulator. This means extremely low flows of gas can be achieved resulting in extended time between refills of a gas bottle and better economy for the user.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">When more flow is required in a specific application one option is to use a proprietary gas hose with a higher flow rate. However, as stated above, gas usage increases and the economics of gas usage are affected.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In order to produce sufficient output of carbon dioxide for the specific application while maintaining economy the medium <b>14</b> can include suitable food grade constituents that will with the aid of natural moisture contained in the medium produce a certain amount of carbon dioxide to supplement the low flow of gas from the gas regulator hose connected to the pressurized cylinder <b>22</b>. The modulator <b>10</b> functions as a reactor in this case while still emitting other lures contained therein and continuing to pulse the carbon dioxide.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">This combined supply of carbon dioxide as described above provides a very economical approach.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The modulator <b>10</b> can be made of any suitable material and be of any suitable size. It can be a permanent device that can be refilled or it can be a throwaway.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> it will be noted that after the CO<sub>2 </sub>has mixed with the attractant medium <b>14</b> pulses or bubbles or plumes <b>45</b> are generated which then exit through spaces <b>22</b> of outlet <b>23</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and between ribs <b>23</b> as shown after passage through flow passage <b>46</b> between inner tube or body <b>16</b> and housing <b>11</b>. It will also be appreciated that such plumes <b>45</b> are represented in gaseous form above modulator <b>10</b> wherein carbon dioxide is represented by lines <b>47</b> in solid outline entrained with a volatile attractant lure <b>48</b> shown in phantom.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> there is shown a mosquito trap <b>50</b> supported on a trolley <b>51</b> also supports gas bottle <b>22</b>.
