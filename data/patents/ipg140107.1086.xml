<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to sporting equipment racks used for carrying items, such as bicycles, on a vehicle. More particularly, the invention relates to a vehicle receiver hitch supported sporting equipment carrier having an integrated locking system to prevent theft of the sporting equipment carried on the carrier.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Bicycling has become a popular activity and enthusiasts engaging in the sport range from experts and professionals who make their livelihoods racing and riding bicycles, to children who simply enjoy the freedom bicycles provide. As would be expected, as the popularity of bicycling has increased, advancements in technology and equipment have followed, and consequently bicycles may have substantial values ranging into the thousands of dollars for professional racing type bicycles.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Unfortunately, as the value of such bicycles has increased, so has the likelihood of theft of such bicycles, which can lead to significant economic loss, insurance claims, damage to professional livelihoods, and even emotional trauma.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Vehicle mounted bicycle carrying racks are known, and are available, in a variety of configurations. Known bicycle carrying racks generally support bicycles in an upright position and engage with the bicycle wheels and/or frame in a variety of ways. Such racks may carry the front and/or rear wheel of the bicycle in a tray, and have an adjustable pivoting arm that also engages with the bicycle frame. Other known racks support the bicycle in an open-top &#x201c;saddle&#x201d; that releasably engages a portion of the bicycle frame so that the bicycle is suspended therefrom. Most bicycle carrying racks further have at least one, and preferably several straps that are used to positionally secure the bicycle to the rack.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The feature that it is lacking from known bicycle carrying racks is an integrated locking system that prevents bicycles carried on the rack from being stolen.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the past, users have attempted to secure bicycles to known bicycle carrying racks using chains, cables or the like that are looped through the bicycle frame, and/or wheels, and around the carrying rack. Unfortunately, such locking cables, chains and the like are necessarily lightweight and must be flexible to be &#x201c;threaded&#x201d; through the various orifices and openings of the bicycle frame and wheels for securement. Correspondingly, because the cables and/or chains are lightweight and flexible, they are also typically relatively easy to cut or otherwise break by a thief who might have access to a bolt cutter, hacksaw, or the like. Known cables, chains and the like can be quickly and rapidly broken/cut by experienced thieves, and before a bicycle owner is aware, the expensive bicycle may be gone and forever lost. This is particularly problematic when a bicycle owner is traveling and needs to stop even briefly, such as to eat, during which time the vehicle carrying the bicycle may be left unattended and out of sight.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Prior efforts to develop locking mechanisms that secure bicycles to bicycle carriers have been made, but such locking mechanisms continue to have drawbacks such as, but not limited to, requiring modification of the bicycle, requiring specific placement of the bicycle on the rack, they are cumbersome, they are expensive, they are difficult to store, they are difficult to operate and they are expensive to manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">What is needed is a locking assembly that is integrated into a bicycle carrying rack that is easy to operate, is difficult for unauthorized people to remove, is easily storable, is easily operable, does not require modification of the bicycle, does not require special attachments, and is suitable for use with nearly any size and configuration of bicycle that might be desired to be carried upon the bicycle rack.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">My invention overcomes various of the aforementioned drawbacks and resolves various of the aforementioned needs by providing a vehicle receiver hitch supported lockable sporting equipment carrier having an integrated locking assembly for prevention of theft of bicycles carried on the rack. My invention is easy to operate, and does not require modification of the bicycle, or any attachments to a bicycle frame. My invention is easily storable within the bicycle rack, and cannot be easily or quickly cut or broken for unauthorized removal of bicycles carried on the rack.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">My invention does not reside in any one of the identified features individually but rather in the synergistic combination of all of its structures, which give rise to the functions necessarily flowing therefrom as hereinafter specified and claimed.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Some or all of the drawbacks and problems explained above, and other drawbacks and problems, may be helped or solved by the invention shown and described herein. My invention may also be used to address other drawbacks and problems not set out herein or which become apparent at a later time. The future may also bring to light unknown benefits which may be in the future appreciated from the novel invention shown and described herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A vehicle receiver hitch supported lockable sporting equipment carrier provides a receiver hitch beam, structurally carrying an upwardly extending vertical beam. A horizontal support beam is structurally carried by the vertical beam, at an end portion opposite the receiver hitch beam. The horizontal support beam defines an axial channel extending therethrough for releasable engagement with a locking bar. The locking bar has one leg that releasably engages with the axial channel defined in the horizontal support beam, and a second leg that releasably engages with a hole defined in the vertical beam, spacedly adjacent the horizontal support beam. A lock hasp hole defined in an end portion of the locking bar provides for engagement of a lock.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In providing such vehicle receiver hitch supported lockable sporting equipment carrier it is:</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">a principal object is to provide a bicycle carrying rack having an integrated locking means.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">a further object to provide such a carrier that is releasably attachable to a vehicle receiver hitch.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">a further object to provide such a carrier that deters theft.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">a further object to provide a carrier that is easy to use, compact, and capable of carrying bicycles of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">a further object to provide such a carrier which includes an integrated locking mechanism that does not require a bicycle to be disassembled to be locked into place.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">a further object to provide such a carrier that does not require modification of the bicycle.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">a further object to provide such a carrier that does not require installation of any apparatus on the bicycle.</p>

<heading id="h-0017" level="1">Overview of the Apparatus</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein, the term &#x201c;forward&#x201d;, its derivatives, and grammatical equivalents refers to that portion of my carrier that is positioned proximate an operator cab of a vehicle having a receiver hitch for supporting the carrier. The term &#x201c;rearward&#x201d;, its derivatives, and grammatical equivalents refers to that portion of my carrier that is positioned distal from the operator cab. The term &#x201c;outer&#x201d;, its derivatives, and grammatical equivalents refers to a driver-side portion or passenger-side portion of a vehicle as opposed to the laterally medial portion of a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">My vehicle receiver hitch supported lockable sporting equipment carrier <b>9</b> generally provides a receiver hitch beam <b>10</b>, a vertical beam <b>20</b>, a horizontal support beam <b>30</b> releasably carrying at least one equipment support <b>50</b>, and a locking bar <b>40</b> that releasably engages with the vertical beam <b>20</b> and horizontal support beam <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The receiver hitch beam <b>10</b> is elongate and has a first end portion <b>11</b> and an opposing second end portion <b>12</b>. A locking pin hole <b>13</b> is defined in the receiver hitch beam <b>10</b> proximate the first end portion <b>11</b> for releasable engagement of a locking pin <b>64</b> to extend therethrough and secure the receiver hitch beam <b>10</b> to a receiver hitch <b>61</b> of a vehicle (not shown). If the receiver hitch beam <b>10</b> is not formed of a solid bar, an axial channel <b>14</b> is defined by the receiver hitch beam <b>10</b> extending from the first end portion <b>11</b> to the second end portion <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The vertical beam <b>20</b> preferably has a peripheral configuration similar to that of the receiver hitch beam <b>10</b>, but may also include other forms such as round, oval and other shapes that are strong as well as aesthetically appealing. The vertical beam <b>20</b> has a first lower end portion <b>21</b> and an opposing second upper end portion <b>22</b> with a medial channel (not shown) extending from the first end portion <b>21</b> to the second end portion <b>22</b>. The first lower end <b>21</b> of the vertical beam <b>20</b> is structurally interconnected with the second end <b>12</b> of the receiver hitch beam <b>10</b> such as by welding so that the vertical beam <b>20</b> extends generally perpendicularly relative to the receiver hitch beam <b>10</b>. It is contemplated however that the receiver hitch beam <b>10</b> and the vertical beam <b>20</b> may also be cast or molded, or otherwise formed as a unitary piece without the need for a seam or joint to interconnect the adjacent end portions thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Support beam hole <b>24</b> is defined in the vertical beam <b>20</b> spacedly adjacent the second upper end <b>22</b>, forming a channel (not shown) extending through the vertical beam <b>20</b> from a front side <b>20</b><i>a </i>to a rear side <b>20</b><i>b</i>. A locking bar hole <b>25</b> is defined in the vertical beam <b>20</b> spacedly adjacent above the support beam hole <b>24</b> more proximate the second upper end <b>22</b>. Similar to the support beam hole <b>24</b>, the locking bar hole <b>25</b> defines a channel (not shown) extending through the vertical beam <b>20</b> from a front side <b>20</b><i>a </i>to a rear side <b>20</b><i>b</i>. Bushing <b>26</b> is carried in the channel (not shown) defined by the locking bar hole <b>25</b> to provide secure engagement with the locking bar <b>40</b> and to reduce metal on metal contact that might cause excessive wear and noise. End cap <b>27</b> is carried at the second end <b>22</b> of the vertical beam <b>20</b> to prevent water, debris and the like from entering the channel (not shown), and also to provide a more aesthetically appealing appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The horizontal support beam <b>30</b> is elongate, has a first end portion <b>31</b> and an opposing second end portion <b>32</b> and defines in axial channel <b>34</b> communicating between the first end portion <b>31</b> and the second end portion <b>32</b>. The horizontal support beam <b>30</b> is structurally interconnected with the vertical beam <b>20</b> and extends through the channel (not shown) defined by the support beam hole <b>24</b> and is structurally secured in place, such as by welding about all immediately adjacent surfaces on both the front side <b>20</b><i>a </i>and the rear side <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the vertical beam <b>20</b>. The horizontal support beam <b>30</b> extends parallel to the receiver hitch beam <b>10</b> in a direction opposite the receiver hitch beam <b>10</b> such that the carrier <b>9</b>, when viewed from a orthographic side view has a squared &#x201c;Z&#x201d; shape. The axial channel <b>34</b> defined by the horizontal support beam <b>30</b> has a first orifice <b>35</b> defining an opening to the axial channel <b>34</b> on the front side <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the vertical beam <b>20</b>, and a second orifice <b>36</b> defining an opening to the axial channel <b>34</b> at the second end portion <b>32</b> of the horizontal support beam <b>30</b> on the rear side <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the vertical beam <b>20</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the horizontal support beam <b>30</b> is formed of stainless steel because of stainless steel's strength, resistance to cutting, durability and resistance to rust, corrosion and the like. It is anticipated however that other materials such as, but not limited to, steel, alloys and composites may likewise be used for the horizontal support beam <b>30</b>. Further the horizontal support beam <b>30</b> is preferably &#x201c;pipe like&#x201d; or cylindrical in configuration having an outer circumferential surface <b>33</b> for adjustably carrying the at least one equipment support <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The at least one equipment support <b>50</b> may have a variety of configurations, but in the preferred embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) includes an elongated base tray <b>51</b> that defines an open top &#x201c;trough&#x201d; such that a portion of a frame <b>63</b> of a bicycle may be carried within the trough which may be orthographical or concave in configuration. A mounting beam sleeve <b>52</b> is structurally interconnected to a bottom portion of the base tray <b>51</b> and provides a means for attaching the at least one equipment support <b>50</b> to the horizontal support beam <b>30</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the mounting beam sleeve <b>52</b> is &#x201c;pipe-like&#x201d; such that the horizontal support beam <b>30</b> may pass through a medial channel <b>56</b> defined by the mounting beam sleeve <b>52</b> so that the mounting beam sleeve <b>52</b> frictionally communicates with the outer circumferential surface <b>33</b> of the horizontal support beam <b>30</b>. Known securing means <b>53</b>, such as, but not limited to, threaded bolts may be carried in radially aligned threaded holes (not shown) defined in the mounting beam sleeve <b>52</b> to frictionally engage with the outer circumferential surface <b>33</b> of the horizontal support beam <b>30</b> to positionally secure the at least one equipment support <b>52</b> on the horizontal support beam <b>30</b> and to prevent undesirable movement of the at least one equipment support <b>50</b> relative to the horizontal support beam <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Known releasable adjustable securing straps <b>54</b>, such as elongate pieces of &#x201c;hook and loop&#x201d; fastener, &#x201c;bungee cords&#x201d; and the like are fastened to the at least equipment support <b>50</b> to positionally secure the bicycle frame <b>63</b> to the at least one equipment support <b>50</b>. In a particularly preferred embodiment, each base tray <b>51</b> of each at least one equipment support <b>50</b> includes an angularly depending leg <b>55</b> at one end portion of the base tray <b>51</b>. The angular leg <b>55</b> is configured to frictionally communicate with a vertical element of the bicycle frame <b>63</b> and be secured thereto with a securing strap <b>54</b> so that the bicycle frame <b>63</b> does not slidably move within the base tray <b>51</b> and does not axially rotate within the base tray <b>51</b> responsive to movement and vibration of the vehicle during use of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The locking bar <b>40</b> has a somewhat horizontal &#x201c;J&#x201d; configuration having a longer first leg <b>43</b>, a shorter second leg <b>44</b> and an offsetting leg <b>45</b> joining the first leg <b>43</b> and the second leg <b>44</b> at proximate end portions thereof so that the second leg <b>44</b> extends parallel to the first leg <b>43</b> and in the same direction. The offsetting leg <b>45</b> need not be straight but may be curvilinear. The first leg <b>43</b>, the offsetting leg <b>45</b> and the second leg <b>44</b> are structurally interconnected at adjacent end portions, such as by welding. In an alternative embodiment, the locking bar <b>40</b> may be bent, or otherwise formed from a unitary piece of material to form the first leg <b>43</b>, the offsetting leg <b>45</b> and the second leg <b>44</b>. A lock hasp hole <b>46</b> is defined in the first leg <b>43</b> proximate first end portion <b>41</b> opposite the offsetting leg <b>45</b> to provide for releasable engagement with a lock (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in Figures, engagement of the locking bar <b>40</b> with the horizontal support beam <b>30</b> and the vertical beam <b>20</b> creates &#x201c;cage&#x201d; about the at least one equipment support <b>50</b> and any bicycles (not shown) carried therein. The first end portion <b>41</b> of the first leg <b>43</b>, opposite the offsetting leg <b>45</b> passes through the locking bar hole <b>25</b> defined in the vertical beam <b>20</b> and the bushing <b>26</b> carried therein, while simultaneously, the second end portion <b>42</b> of the second leg <b>44</b>, opposite the offsetting leg <b>45</b> passes into the second orifice <b>36</b> and engages with the axial channel <b>34</b> defined in the horizontal support beam <b>30</b>. After the first and second legs <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> respectively of the locking bar <b>40</b> are engaged with the locking bar hole <b>25</b> and the axial channel <b>34</b> of the horizontal support beam <b>30</b> and the first end portion <b>41</b> of the first leg <b>43</b> has passed completely through the locking bar hole <b>25</b> defined in the vertical beam <b>20</b> and extends outwardly from the first side <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the vertical beam <b>20</b>, a known lock (not shown) preferably a &#x201c;shoulder-type lock&#x201d; having an approximately &#xbe;&#x2033; opening between its shoulder portions, a commercially available example of which is identified as a TMC 10FL TRIMAX Deluxe Key Coupler Lock manufactured by TRIMAX&#x2122; Corporation of Englewood Colo., USA (similar &#x201c;shoulder-type locks&#x201d; are available from other lock manufacturers as well) is engaged with the also available by other companies lock hasp hole <b>46</b> defined in the first leg <b>43</b> of the locking bar <b>40</b> on a front side <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the vertical beam <b>20</b>. Engagement of the lock (not shown) with the lock hasp hole <b>46</b> prevents the locking bar <b>40</b> from being axially withdrawn from the locking bar hole <b>25</b>. The inability to axially withdraw the locking bar <b>40</b> from the locking bar hole <b>25</b> defined in the vertical beam <b>20</b> maintains engagement of the second leg <b>44</b> with the axial channel <b>34</b> defined in the horizontal support beam <b>30</b>. The inability to remove, or otherwise axially twist the locking bar <b>40</b> maintains the &#x201c;cage&#x201d; surrounding and engaging the bicycle frame <b>63</b> carried on the carrier <b>9</b>. Only by removing the lock (not shown) engaged with the lock hasp hole <b>46</b> may the locking bar <b>40</b> be withdrawn and the bicycles (not shown) be removed from the carrier <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The identified shoulder-type coupler lock is preferred because it has a structural configuration that tightly engages with the locking bar <b>40</b> and lock hasp hole <b>46</b>, and does not allow easy access to the lock hasp by a bolt cutter, or other device that might be used to cut the lock from the carrier. Other coupler locks may likewise be used, but I have found the aforementioned TRIMAX shoulder-type coupler lock to be preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the locking bar <b>40</b> may be stored within the axial channel <b>34</b> of the horizontal support beam <b>30</b> by inserting the first end portion <b>41</b> of the first leg <b>43</b> of the locking bar <b>40</b>, into the first opening orifice <b>35</b> of the axial channel <b>34</b> from a front side <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the vertical beam <b>20</b>, opposite the horizontal support beam <b>30</b>, and simultaneously passing the second end portion <b>42</b> of the second leg <b>44</b> into and through the locking bar hole <b>25</b> on the front side <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the vertical beam <b>20</b> and thereafter securing a lock (not shown) in the lock hasp hole <b>46</b> defined in the first leg <b>43</b>. Such secure storage of the locking bar <b>40</b> will prevent theft of the locking bar <b>40</b> and also prevents any rattling and otherwise disturbing noises that may be generated by the locking bar <b>40</b> when bicycles are not stored on the carrier <b>9</b> and the vehicle (not shown) is operated.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="1">Construction and Materials of the Apparatus</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The receiver hitch beam <b>10</b> and the vertical beam <b>20</b> are preferably formed of steel box beams of strong rigid material such as, but not limited to, steel, stainless steel, aluminum, aluminum alloys, composites, and the like. Although the receiver hitch beam <b>10</b> is necessarily of a box beam configuration to engage with the receiver hitch <b>61</b>, the vertical beam <b>20</b> need not have a box beam configuration and it is anticipated that other configurations, such as round, oval, and orthogonal shapes may also be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The locking bar <b>40</b> is preferably formed from hardened steel, stainless steel or other metal alloys that are difficult to cut. Preferably the locking bar <b>40</b> is formed from solid bar stock.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The horizontal support beam <b>30</b> is preferably formed of stainless steel because of the material's strength, durability, hardness, resistance to cutting and bending and resistance to corrosion such as rust and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Having described the structure of my vehicle receiver hitch supported lockable sporting equipment carrier, its operation may be understood.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The carrier <b>9</b> is oriented so that the first end portion <b>11</b> of the receiver hitch beam <b>10</b> may be axially inserted into a channel (not shown) defined by a receiver hitch <b>61</b> carried by a vehicle (not shown). The first end portion <b>11</b> of the receiver hitch beam <b>10</b> is thereupon axially inserted into the receiver hitch channel (not shown). The locking pin hole <b>13</b> is aligned with locking pin holes (not shown) defined in the receiver hitch <b>61</b> and a locking pin <b>64</b> is inserted therethrough to positionally secure the carrier <b>9</b> relative to the receiver hitch <b>61</b> and vehicle (not shown). If desired, the locking pin <b>64</b> may be lockable to prevent unauthorized removal.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The locking bar <b>40</b> is removed from engagement with the locking bar hole <b>25</b> defined in the vertical beam <b>20</b> and from the axial channel <b>34</b> defined by the horizontal support beam <b>30</b> by axially withdrawing the locking bar <b>40</b>, relative to the horizontal support beam <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">At least one equipment support <b>50</b> is positioned on the horizontal support beam <b>30</b>, by passing the mounting beam sleeve <b>52</b> of the equipment support <b>50</b> over and about the circumferential surface <b>33</b> of the horizontal support beam <b>30</b>. Friction fittings <b>53</b> are tightened to positionally secure the mounting beam sleeve <b>52</b> and attached base tray <b>51</b> to the horizontal support beam <b>30</b>. The orientation of the equipment support <b>50</b> may be adjusted as necessary depending upon the configuration of the bicycle frame <b>63</b>. Once the orientation of the base tray <b>51</b> has been determined, the friction fittings <b>53</b> should be securely tightened so that the equipment support <b>50</b> does not rotate or move relative to the horizontal support beam <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The securing straps <b>54</b> are loosened and a bicycle is placed within the base tray <b>51</b> so that the bicycle frame <b>63</b> rests within the trough and the bicycle depends therefrom. The bicycle frame <b>63</b> should be moved elongately relative to the base tray <b>51</b> so that the angular leg <b>55</b> of the equipment support <b>50</b> frictionally communicates with a vertically extending portion of the bicycle frame <b>62</b>, such as a bicycle seat support. The securing straps <b>54</b> are thereafter secured about the bicycle frame <b>63</b> to positionally maintain the bicycle frame <b>63</b> within the base tray <b>51</b> and frictionally against the angular leg <b>55</b> to prevent any movement or rotation of the bicycle frame <b>63</b> relative to the equipment support <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">If more than one bicycle is to be fastened to the carrier <b>9</b>, the process, as noted above, is repeated for the second and any subsequent bicycle.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The locking bar <b>40</b> is installed by orienting the locking bar <b>40</b> such that the first leg <b>43</b> is horizontal relative to the ground and the first leg is positioned vertically above the second leg <b>44</b>, and the offsetting leg <b>45</b> is distal from the vertical beam <b>20</b>. The first end portion <b>41</b> of the first leg <b>43</b> is inserted into the locking bar hole <b>25</b>. Once the first end portion <b>41</b> of the first leg <b>43</b> has entered into the locking bar hole <b>25</b> the locking bar <b>40</b> may be rotated axially about the first leg <b>43</b> to align the second leg <b>44</b> with the second orifice <b>36</b> to the axial channel <b>34</b> defined by the horizontal support beam <b>30</b>. Once the second end portion <b>42</b> of the second leg <b>44</b> is axially aligned with the second orifice <b>36</b> to the axial channel <b>34</b>, the locking bar <b>40</b> is moved axially toward the vertical beam <b>20</b> so that the second leg <b>44</b> of the locking beam <b>40</b> enters into and engages with the axial channel <b>34</b> defined by the horizontal support beam <b>30</b>. A lock (not shown) is thereafter engaged with the lock hasp hole <b>46</b> defined in the first end portion <b>41</b> of the first leg <b>43</b> of the locking bar <b>40</b>, on the front side <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the vertical beam <b>20</b> opposite the horizontal support beam <b>30</b> and the bicycles.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the bicycles are to be removed from the carrier <b>9</b>, the lock (not shown) engaged with the lock hasp hole <b>46</b> defined in the first end portion <b>41</b> of the first leg <b>43</b> is disengaged, such as with a key, and removed from the lock hasp hole <b>46</b>. Thereafter, the locking bar <b>40</b> may be axially withdrawn from the locking bar hole <b>25</b> such that the locking bar <b>40</b> is disengaged from the carrier <b>9</b>, and the bicycles may be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">To store the locking bar <b>40</b>, such as when the carrier <b>9</b> is not in use, the locking bar <b>40</b> is oriented such that the first leg <b>43</b> and the second leg <b>44</b> are horizontal relative to the ground with the second leg <b>44</b> vertically above the first leg <b>43</b>. The first end portion <b>41</b> of the first leg <b>43</b> is aligned with the first orifice <b>35</b> to the axial channel <b>34</b> on a front side <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the vertical beam <b>20</b>, and is inserted therein. The second end portion <b>42</b> of the second leg <b>44</b> is aligned with the locking bar hole <b>25</b> on a front side <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the vertical beam <b>20</b>, and the second leg is thereafter passed into and through the locking bar hole <b>25</b> so that the second end portion <b>42</b> of the second leg <b>44</b> passes through the vertical beam <b>20</b> and extends outwardly from a rear side <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the vertical beam <b>20</b> proximate the horizontal support beam <b>30</b>. Thereafter, a lock (not shown) is engaged with the lock hasp hole <b>46</b> which secures the locking bar <b>40</b> in place and prevents theft or loss thereof.</p>
