<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system for integrated power combiners is disclosed and may include receiving optical signals in input optical waveguides and phase-modulating the signals to configure a phase offset between signals received at a first optical coupler, where the first optical coupler may generate output signals having substantially equal optical powers. Output signals of the first optical coupler may be phase-modulated to configure a phase offset between signals received at a second optical coupler, which may generate an output signal having an optical power of essentially zero and a second output signal having a maximized optical power. Optical signals received by the input optical waveguides may be generated utilizing a polarization-splitting grating coupler to enable polarization-insensitive combining of optical signals. Optical power may be monitored using optical detectors. The monitoring of optical power may be used to determine a desired phase offset between the signals received at the first optical coupler.</p>

<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Certain embodiments of the invention relate to signal processing. More specifically, certain embodiments of the invention relate to a method and system for integrated power combiners.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As data networks scale to meet ever-increasing bandwidth requirements, the shortcomings of copper data channels are becoming apparent. Signal attenuation and crosstalk due to radiated electromagnetic energy are the main impediments encountered by designers of such systems. They can be mitigated to some extent with equalization, coding, and shielding, but these techniques require considerable power, complexity, and cable bulk penalties while offering only modest improvements in reach and very limited scalability. Free of such channel limitations, optical communication has been recognized as the successor to copper links.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Optical communication systems have been widely adopted for applications ranging from internet backbone, local area networks, data centers, supercomputing, to high-definition video. Due to superior bandwidth and low loss, optical fibers are the medium of choice for transporting high-speed binary data.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further limitations and disadvantages of conventional and traditional approaches will become apparent to one of skill in the art, through comparison of such systems with the present invention as set forth in the remainder of the present application with reference to the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A system and/or method for integrated power combiners, substantially as shown in and/or described in connection with at least one of the figures, as set forth more completely in the claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Certain aspects of the invention may be found in a system for integrated power combiners. Exemplary aspects of the invention may comprise a chip comprising an optical power combiner in a photonic circuit, where the optical power combiner comprises input optical waveguides, optical couplers, and output optical waveguides. Optical signals may be received in each of the input optical waveguides and phase-modulated to configure a phase offset between signals received at a first optical coupler, wherein the first optical coupler may generate output signals with substantially equal optical powers. One or both output signals of the first optical coupler may be phase-modulated to configure a phase offset between signals received at a second optical coupler. The second optical coupler generates an output signal in a first of the output optical waveguides having an optical power of essentially zero and an output signal in a second of the output optical waveguides having a maximized optical power. The optical couplers may comprise, for example, directional couplers, and the chip may comprise, for example, a CMOS chip. Optical signals received by the input optical waveguides may be generated utilizing a polarization-splitting grating coupler, wherein the polarization splitting grating coupler enables polarization-insensitive combining of optical signals utilizing the optical power combiner. Optical power in waveguides coupling the optical couplers may be monitored using optical detectors. The monitoring of optical power may be used to determine a desired phase offset between the signals received at the first optical coupler, and optical signals may be communicated to the optical detectors utilizing optical taps in the coupling waveguides.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a block diagram of a photonically enabled CMOS chip comprising integrated power combiners, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, there is shown optoelectronic devices on a CMOS chip <b>130</b> comprising optical modulators <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>D, photodiodes <b>111</b>A-<b>111</b>D, monitor photodiodes <b>113</b>A-<b>113</b>H, and optical devices comprising taps <b>103</b>A-<b>103</b>K, optical terminations <b>115</b>A-<b>115</b>D, and grating couplers <b>117</b>A-<b>117</b>H. There are also shown electrical devices and circuits comprising amplifiers <b>107</b>A-<b>107</b>D, analog and digital control circuits <b>109</b>, and control sections <b>112</b>A-<b>112</b>D. The amplifiers <b>107</b>A-<b>107</b>D may comprise transimpedance and limiting amplifiers (TIA/LAs), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Optical signals are communicated between optical and optoelectronic devices via optical waveguides <b>110</b> fabricated in the CMOS chip <b>130</b>. Single-mode or multi-mode waveguides may be used in photonic integrated circuits. Single-mode operation enables direct connection to optical signal processing and networking elements. The term &#x201c;single-mode&#x201d; may be used for waveguides that support a single mode for each of the two polarizations, transverse-electric (TE) and transverse-magnetic (TM), or for waveguides that are truly single mode and only support one mode whose polarization is TE, which comprises an electric field parallel to the substrate supporting the waveguides. Two typical waveguide cross-sections that are utilized comprise strip waveguides and rib waveguides. Strip waveguides typically comprise a rectangular cross-section, whereas rib waveguides comprise a rib section on top of a waveguide slab.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The optical modulators <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>D comprise Mach-Zehnder or ring modulators, for example, and enable the modulation of the continuous-wave (CW) laser input signal. The optical modulators <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>D comprise high-speed and low-speed phase modulation sections and are controlled by the control sections <b>112</b>A-<b>112</b>D. The high-speed phase modulation section of the optical modulators <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>D may modulate a CW light source signal with a data signal. The low-speed phase modulation section of the optical modulators <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>D may compensate for slowly varying phase factors such as those induced by mismatch between the waveguides, waveguide temperature, or waveguide stress and is referred to as the passive phase, or the passive biasing of the MZI.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The phase modulators may have a dual role: to compensate for the passive biasing of the MZI and to apply the additional phase modulation used to modulate the light intensity at the output port of the MZI according to a data stream. The former phase tuning and the latter phase modulation may be applied by separate, specialized devices, since the former is a low speed, slowly varying contribution, while the latter is typically a high speed signal. These devices are then respectively referred to as the LSPM and the HSPM. Examples for LSPM are thermal phase modulators (TPM), where a waveguide portion is locally heated up to modify the index of refraction of its constituting materials, or forward biased PIN junction phase modulators (PINPM) where current injection into the PIN junction modifies the carrier density, and thus the index of refraction of the semiconductor material. An example of an HSPM is a reversed biased PIN junction, where the index of refraction is also modulated via the carrier density, but which allows much faster operation, albeit at a lower phase modulation efficiency per waveguide length.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The outputs of the modulators <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>D may be optically coupled via the waveguides <b>110</b> to the grating couplers <b>117</b>E-<b>117</b>H. The taps <b>103</b>D-<b>103</b>K comprise four-port optical couplers, for example, and are utilized to sample the optical signals generated by the optical modulators <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>D, with the sampled signals being measured by the monitor photodiodes <b>113</b>A-<b>113</b>H. The unused branches of the taps <b>103</b>D-<b>103</b>K are terminated by optical terminations <b>115</b>A-<b>115</b>D to avoid back reflections of unwanted signals.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The grating couplers <b>117</b>A-<b>117</b>H comprise optical gratings that enable coupling of light into and out of the CMOS chip <b>130</b>. The grating couplers <b>117</b>A-<b>117</b>D may be utilized to couple light received from optical fibers into the CMOS chip <b>130</b>, and the grating couplers <b>117</b>E-<b>117</b>H may be utilized to couple light from the CMOS chip <b>130</b> into optical fibers. The grating couplers <b>117</b>A-<b>117</b>H may comprise single polarization grating couplers (SPGC) and/or polarization splitting grating couplers (PSGC). In instances where a PSGC is utilized, two input, or output, waveguides may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The optical fibers may be epoxied, for example, to the CMOS chip, and may be aligned at an angle from normal to the surface of the CMOS chip <b>130</b> to optimize coupling efficiency. In an embodiment of the invention, the optical fibers may comprise single-mode fiber (SMF) and/or polarization-maintaining fiber (PMF).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In another exemplary embodiment, optical signals may be communicated directly into the surface of the CMOS chip <b>130</b> without optical fibers by directing a light source on an optical coupling device in the chip, such as the light source interface <b>135</b> and/or the optical fiber interface <b>139</b>. This may be accomplished with directed laser sources and/or optical sources on another chip flip-chip bonded to the CMOS chip <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The photodiodes <b>111</b>A-<b>111</b>D may convert optical signals received from the grating couplers <b>117</b>A-<b>117</b>D into electrical signals that are communicated to the amplifiers <b>107</b>A-<b>107</b>D for processing. In another embodiment of the invention, the photodiodes <b>111</b>A-<b>111</b>D may comprise high-speed heterojunction phototransistors, for example, and may comprise germanium (Ge) in the collector and base regions for absorption in the 1.3-1.6 &#x3bc;m optical wavelength range, and may be integrated on a CMOS silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The analog and digital control circuits <b>109</b> may control gain levels or other parameters in the operation of the amplifiers <b>107</b>A-<b>107</b>D, which may then communicate electrical signals off the CMOS chip <b>130</b>. The control sections <b>112</b>A-<b>112</b>D comprise electronic circuitry that enable modulation of the CW laser signal received from the splitters <b>103</b>A-<b>103</b>C. The optical modulators <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>D may require high-speed electrical signals to modulate the refractive index in respective branches of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), for example. In an embodiment of the invention, the control sections <b>112</b>A-<b>112</b>D may include sink and/or source driver electronics that may enable a bidirectional link utilizing a single laser.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In operation, the CMOS chip <b>130</b> may be operable to transmit and/or receive and process optical signals. The grating couplers <b>117</b>A-<b>117</b>D may be operable to receive optical signals from optical fibers coupled to the chip <b>130</b> and may convert the optical mode of the fiber into the much smaller mode of a Si waveguide fabricated on the CMOS SOI wafer. The grating couplers <b>117</b>A-<b>117</b>D may comprise a single-polarization or a polarization-splitting type: in the first case, only a specific polarization is coupled to a single Si waveguide, while in the second case, two orthogonal polarizations are split into two output waveguides.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Integrated photonics platforms allow the full functionality of an optical transceiver to be integrated on a single chip, the CMOS chip <b>130</b>, for example. A transceiver chip comprise opto-electronic circuits that create and process the optical/electrical signals on the transmitter (Tx) and the receiver (Rx) sides, as well as optical interfaces that couple the optical signal to and from one or more fiber. The signal processing functionality may comprise modulating the optical carrier, detecting the optical signal, splitting or combining data streams, and multiplexing or demultiplexing data on carriers with different wavelengths.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The light source may be external to the chip or may be integrated with the chip in a hybrid scheme. It is often advantageous to have an external continuous-wave (CW) light source, because this architecture allows heat sinking and temperature control of the source separately from the transceiver chip <b>130</b>. An external light source may also be connected to the transceiver chip <b>130</b> via a fiber interface.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An integrated transceiver may comprise at least three optical interfaces, including a transmitter input port to interface to the CW light source, labeled as CW Laser In <b>101</b>; a transmitter output port to interface to the fiber carrying the optical signal, labeled Optical Signals Out; and a receiver input port to interface to the fiber carrying the optical signal, labeled Optical Signals In.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Waveguide photodetectors may be incorporated in integrated optics platforms, where several components are integrated together on a single receiver chip, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. In this platform, light couplers, such as the optical couplers <b>117</b>A-<b>117</b>D, couple the optical signal from the fiber into optical waveguides <b>110</b>. The optical signal subsequently enters the waveguide detectors <b>111</b>A-<b>111</b>D, where it is converted to an electrical signal. In some embodiments, the coupler may comprise a grating coupler, in which case the fiber is oriented in a near normal configuration to the chip <b>130</b> surface.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In instances where the fiber medium carries the signal in a single optical mode, the receiver subsystem on the chip, comprising the light coupler, the waveguide, and the waveguide detector, may be designed to support a single mode. Because the single-mode fiber mode has two polarization states, the term &#x201c;single-mode waveguide&#x201d; is used both for waveguides that support a single mode for each of the two polarizations (TE and TM) or for waveguides that only support one mode whose polarization is TE, with the electric field parallel to the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The fibers may be either single-mode fibers (SMFs), polarization-maintaining fibers (PMFs) or some other fiber type. To facilitate efficient optical signal processing, the waveguides carrying the signal on the transceiver chip <b>130</b> may support one mode with a single polarization. In contrast, the optical mode in SMFs has two orthogonal polarizations. Since the CW light source has a well-defined polarization, one option is to employ PMFs in order to retain a single polarization throughout the system. However, PMFs are costly and more difficult to align accurately than SMFs. For this reason, SMFs may be used in an optical interconnect, thereby requiring input ports to accept signals in arbitrary polarizations. A polarization splitting grating coupler (PSGC) may be used to generate two optical modes from a received input optical signal. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, an optical power combiner may be utilized to efficiently combine optical signals of unknown phase and intensity generated by the PSGC.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the integrated power may enable locating the CW laser source remotely, with the optical source signal communicated to the CMOS chip <b>130</b> via optical fiber, as opposed to mounting a laser in the laser module <b>147</b> directly over a grating coupler.</p>

The directional couplers may comprise a multi-stage directional coupler comprising a plurality of directional couplers cascaded in series. The coupling waveguides <b>517</b> may be operable to communicate optical signals between the couplers <b>505</b>A and <b>505</b>B and the phase modulators <b>503</b>A and <b>503</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The phase and the intensity in the two output waveguides emanating from a PSGC is unknown since it depends on the polarization state in the fiber, so the light from the waveguides may not be combined passively, such as physically joining the waveguides side-by-side.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a block diagram of an exemplary optical power combiner with phase modulators in each waveguide stage, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there is shown an optical power combiner <b>600</b> comprising input waveguides <b>601</b>A and <b>601</b>B, phase modulators <b>603</b>A and <b>603</b>B, optical couplers <b>605</b>A and <b>605</b>B, coupling waveguides <b>617</b>, and output waveguides <b>607</b>A and <b>607</b>B. The optical couplers <b>605</b>A and <b>605</b>B may be directional couplers, or multi-mode interference couplers, for example, and may exhibit a tapping ratio of approximately 50%, for example. The optical power combiner <b>600</b> may, for example, be substantially similar to the optical power combiner <b>500</b> but with phase modulators in each waveguide stage. The coupling waveguides <b>617</b> may be operable to communicate optical signals between the couplers <b>605</b>A and <b>605</b>B and the phase modulators <b>603</b>A-<b>603</b>D.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The optical power combiner <b>600</b> may be controlled, for instance, by using power monitors that tap some portion of the light off from both waveguides into detectors to monitor the signals, as illustrated further with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The phase modulators <b>603</b>A and <b>603</b>B may be configured so that the power detected in each path following the coupler <b>605</b>A is approximately equal. The phase modulators <b>603</b>C and <b>603</b>D may then be configured by maximizing the power in the desired output waveguide <b>607</b>A or <b>607</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In another embodiment of the invention, the optical power combiner <b>600</b> may comprise a plurality of stages, with each stage comprising pairs of phase modulators/couplers. This may enable a larger capacity to correct for unknown polarization fluctuations and uneven power splitting in the optical couplers.</p>

The power detectors <b>711</b>A and <b>171</b>B may comprise photodetectors, for example, that may be operable to detect the magnitude of optical signals received from the taps <b>709</b>A and <b>709</b>B.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">that is, the powers in the output waveguides <b>807</b>A and <b>807</b>B are thus equal. As in the case of the power combiners <b>600</b> and <b>700</b>, the optical power equalizer <b>800</b> may be augmented with an additional phase modulator in the alternate input waveguide, a control system with taps and monitors, and control electronics.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a block diagram of a polarization-insensitive combiner, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, there is shown a polarization-insensitive combiner <b>900</b> comprising an input fiber <b>901</b>, a polarization-splitting grating coupler <b>915</b>, phase modulators <b>903</b>A and <b>903</b>B, optical couplers <b>905</b>A and <b>905</b>B, coupling waveguides <b>917</b>, and output waveguides <b>907</b>A and <b>907</b>B. The coupling waveguides <b>917</b> may be operable to communicate optical signals between the couplers <b>905</b>A and <b>905</b>B, the polarization splitting grating coupler <b>915</b>, and the phase modulators <b>903</b>A and <b>903</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the polarization-insensitive combiner <b>900</b> combines light from an arbitrary polarization state in the fiber <b>901</b> into a single waveguide on the transceiver chip, either output waveguide <b>907</b>A and <b>907</b>B depending on the control of the phase modulators <b>903</b>A and <b>903</b>B, thereby reducing the complexity of other opto-electronic circuits on the chip.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The polarization-splitting grating coupler <b>915</b> accepts light from the input fiber <b>901</b>. Light with an arbitrary polarization is redirected into the two output waveguides of the polarization-splitting grating coupler <b>915</b>, where the two signals can have an arbitrary phase and amplitude relationship. Using the combiner described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> following the polarization-splitting grating coupler <b>915</b>, the power is combined into a single output waveguide, either the waveguide <b>907</b>A or <b>907</b>B. The polarization-splitting grating coupler <b>915</b> may be replaced with any device having the functionality of a polarization splitter.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Controlling the phase modulators <b>903</b>A and <b>903</b>B may be achieved by maximizing the signal in the output waveguide, <b>907</b>A or <b>907</b>B, or minimizing the signal in the alternate waveguide. As in the case of the power combiner, the polarization-insensitive combiner <b>900</b> may be combined with an additional phase modulator in the alternate waveguides, a control system with taps and monitors, and control electronics. Furthermore, utilizing the polarization-insensitive combiner <b>900</b> at the transmitter input port allows connecting the CW light source to the transceiver chip using a single-mode fiber instead of a polarization-maintaining fiber, and on the receiver side, the polarization-insensitive combiner <b>900</b> used as the input port obviates the need for duplicating the signal processing circuits on the receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a block diagram of a polarization controller, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, there is shown a polarization controller <b>1000</b> comprising an input fiber <b>1001</b>, a polarization-splitting grating coupler <b>1015</b>, phase modulators <b>1003</b>A and <b>1003</b>B, optical couplers <b>1005</b>A and <b>1005</b>B, coupling waveguides <b>1017</b>, and an output waveguide <b>1007</b>. The coupling waveguides <b>1017</b> may be operable to communicate optical signals between the couplers <b>1005</b>A and <b>1005</b>B, the polarization splitting grating coupler <b>1015</b>, and the phase modulators <b>1003</b>A and <b>1003</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The polarization controller <b>1000</b> may substantially comprise the polarization-insensitive combiner <b>900</b> operating in reverse, such that it may be used to launch light into a fiber or waveguide in any desired polarization state. The input waveguide <b>1007</b> receives the optical signal coming from the rest of the opto-electronic circuit on the chip. By adjusting the two phase modulators <b>1003</b>A and <b>1003</b>B, an arbitrary polarization state may be generated in the output fiber <b>1001</b>. As in the case of the power combiners, the polarization controller <b>1000</b> may be combined with an additional phase modulator in the alternate waveguides, a control system with taps and monitors, and control electronics.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In another embodiment of the invention, the optical polarization controller <b>1000</b> may comprise a plurality of stages, with each stage comprising pairs of phase modulators/couplers. This may enable a larger capacity to correct for unknown polarization fluctuations and uneven power splitting in the optical couplers.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a block diagram of a polarization-insensitive splitter, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, there is shown a polarization controller <b>1100</b> comprising an input fiber <b>1101</b>, a polarization-splitting grating coupler <b>1115</b>, a phase modulator <b>1103</b>, an optical coupler <b>1105</b>, coupling waveguides <b>1117</b>, and output waveguides <b>1107</b>A and <b>1107</b>B. The coupling waveguides <b>1117</b> may be operable to communicate optical signals between the coupler <b>1105</b>, the polarization splitting grating coupler <b>1115</b>, and the phase modulator <b>1103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In multi-channel parallel transceiver architectures, power from the light source is typically split between several channels. For a two-channel system, the CW light coupled onto the chip is split evenly between the two channels before it enters the modulators. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the first stage of the polarization-insensitive combiner <b>1100</b> may be utilized to achieve this functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">As described with respect to the power combiners, the phase modulator <b>803</b> may be adjusted so that the powers in the output waveguides <b>1107</b>A and <b>1107</b>B are substantially equal for an arbitrary input polarization of light in the fiber. In addition, as in the case of the power combiner, the polarization-insensitive combiner <b>1100</b> may be combined with an additional phase modulator in the alternate waveguide, a control system with taps and monitors, and control electronics.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In another embodiment of the invention, the polarization-insensitive combiner <b>1100</b> may also be used in a transmitter with more than two channels. For instance, in a four-channel device, the polarization insensitive combiner and splitter may be followed by a passive splitter to further subdivide the incoming CW light into four, with each pair of outputs being controlled to output equal powers via phase modulation adjustments. And in yet another embodiment of the invention, the polarization-insensitive combiner <b>1100</b> may also be used in the receiver of quadrature demodulation systems where light is split evenly between two waveguides after it is received from a fiber.</p>
