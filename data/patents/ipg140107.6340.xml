<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates generally to a media file distribution system and method, and more particularly, to a system and methodology that provides end-to-end management of distribution of a media asset.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The task of distributing media files from network content providers to recipient media front-end customers, such as cable providers, and the like (collectively called &#x201c;recipient sites&#x201d; herein), has become a complex process. This is mainly due to competing interests in file formats, transmission protocols, processing requirements, program guide entry format, and various other parameters configured according to different standards as amongst the various content and service providers involved in the distribution process. Accordingly, inordinate amounts of time are now spent converting formats in order for content providers, distributors, and the recipient site customers to manipulate and modify media files throughout the distribution process in order to comply with their diverse system requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The typical media file is a media/digital file for use in video playback, gaming, or any other digital medium. Such a file is sent over satellite, the Internet, or other network, to those involved in distribution and final presentation to the public from the front end or to the recipient site customers. A data control file arrives with the media file which data file must be constantly modified with each conversion to a new system. Current systems typically transmit the control file in one of three ways. The first is to target a unique metadata control file to each receiving site, thereby requiring N number of files for N sites. The second way is to send one generalized file to all receiving sites and then have a site-specific transformation occur at each site dictated by information stored at each site that is triggered by the general information in the control file. A third way to is to send one control file to all receiving sites and then to require each site to process the one format in that control file to be used, but this approach precludes any site specificity. In each of these approaches limitations are necessarily imposed on, for example, the amount and types of different properties that can be applied to an ingested media file, and its distribution characteristics. Further, multiple systems are required, increasing the working time and likelihood of errors, as well as causing synchronization issues. For example, these approaches can be characterized by the frequent failure of in-bound value readers to pass data that is expected by site-specific transform mechanisms. Users in these media distribution system are then forced to manually adjust all of the media assets within the schedule accordingly, while continuing to monitor any additional changes that might be introduced by any of the entities that play a role in, or that otherwise involved in the overall media distribution system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In summary, no current system performs end-to-end automated ingestion and monitoring of media assets.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Briefly, and in general terms, the claimed invention resolves the aforementioned and other problems by providing a media file distribution data system and method. A single media file is used for distribution to two or more recipient sites. A first recipient site has first parameter requirements for processing the media file, and a second recipient site has second parameter requirements for processing the media file that are different from the first parameter requirements. A first set of parameters is included in the media file that meets the first parameter requirements. Further, a second set of parameters is included in the media file that meets the second parameter requirements. In this regard, the first set of parameters is for use during distribution to the first recipient site, and the second set of parameters is for use during distribution to the second recipient site.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with another aspect of a system and method for automated processing of a media file for distribution. In the distribution system and method, a media file is received for distribution. The media file has an asset type, and is validated according to one or more requirements according to the asset type. As a result of validating, one or more errors are produced. These errors are corrected by applying a rules application to the media file. The media file is then distributed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with another aspect of a system and method for automated processing of a media file for distribution to a recipient site. A media file is provided for distribution. The multi-media file is processed to produce data parameters for distribution. A receiving status of the recipient site is checked. One or more of the data parameters are changed according to the receiving status of the recipient site. For example, according to one embodiment, the data parameters are changed according to a set or rules defined in a contract with the recipient site. The media file is then distributed to the recipient site according to the data parameters. Further, an interface is provided so as to allow an operator of the recipient site to view status information regarding distribution of the media file.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with another aspect of a preferred embodiment, the claimed invention is a system and method for optimizing distribution of a media file to a plurality of recipient sites. A receive status of a first recipient site is checked, thereby producing a first status check result. A receive status of a second recipient site is checked, thereby producing a second status check result. Based on the first status check result and the second status check result, a rules engine is applied to determine a priority for distribution to the first recipient site respective of the second recipient site. The media file is then distributed to the first recipient site and the second recipient site according to the determined priority.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with another aspect of a preferred embodiment, the claimed invention is a system and method for providing connectivity in a media file distribution system. The system includes a data store, a portion of which is for storing a media file received from a content provider. A database in the data store contains editable parameters for distribution to the recipient site. An interface to the database allows the content provider to edit the parameters. The interface further allows the recipient site to edit the parameters. A distribution &#x201c;sub system&#x201d; is configured for distributing the media file according to the parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with another aspect of a preferred embodiment, the claimed invention is a system and method for providing interactive program guide entry for a media file. A distribution hub stores a media file received from a content provider for distribution to a recipient site. An interface to the distribution hub allows editing of program guide data for the media file. The interface stores the program guide data to the media file. The interface further allows the content provider to view the program guide data for the media file. In one embodiment, the interface further allows the content provider to edit the program guide data, and to set parameters regarding editing of the program guide data by the recipient site.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with another aspect of a preferred embodiment, the claimed invention is a system and method for providing a multi-port catcher. The system includes a computer, a data store, and a network connection for connecting the computer to a network. In one aspect of this embodiment, a partition application is executed on the computer to partition the computer into multiple partitions. A catcher application executes in each partition. Each catcher application is capable of receiving a separate media file over the network connection, simultaneously. Each media file is stored in the data store. The system may use a plurality of catcher applications, wherein, for example, a first partition executes a first catcher application, and a second partition executes a second catcher application. Therefore, the first catcher application can use a different protocol than the second catcher application. In this sense, the partition application is configured to divide processing of a processor of the computer into virtual computers, such that each of the media files are received by a partition executing in one of the virtual computers.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, one of the partitions is configured as a content provider itself, such that one or more of the media files can be provided internally from the data store into the catcher without using a separate computer to provide the one or more media files to the catcher. In this or other embodiments, one of the partitions is further configured as a gateway computer to provide gateway processing for each of the other partitions.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with another aspect of a preferred embodiment, the claimed invention is a system and method for administrating a contract for distribution of a media file. A media file is received from a content provider, after which, contract parameter data is entered into the media file according to a contract between the content provider and a recipient site. Metadata is calculated for the media file based on the contract parameter data. The media file is then distributed to the recipient site. In one embodiment, by way of example, and not by limitation, the contract data includes price limitations that the recipient site can charge for viewing of the media file. As another example, and not by limitation, the contract data includes time limitations defining limitations regarding a time that the recipient site can present the media file.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals denote like or corresponding parts throughout the drawings and, more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-12</figref>, there is shown one embodiment of a media file distribution system in accordance with the claimed invention. Specifically, the claimed invention provides an asset management and delivery system for the distribution of digital files and data. The system has two major functions, with sub-functions within each. The system first serves as a fully automated management system for a company involved in video/file distribution, such as in video on demand (VOD) or other digital file industries. The system can ingest, prepare, schedule, transmit, track and report on any aspect of the business chain. Secondly, it also serves as a product for both content providers and recipient sites to be able to view, manage and run their entire content offering remotely from anywhere through the internet.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">There are three typical users for the system. One is any company or individual distributing digital media and associated information. They would typically use the system to automate distribution. Another user is a content provider in the digital media space. This entity can use the system to enter assets, track them at their destination, and receive reports on them. Another typical user is a receiving client or customer who can use the system to view and alter their assets, and schedule, monitor or change their receiving equipment setup or architecture. With each &#x201c;sub module&#x201d; described as follows, the usefulness of the claimed system will become apparent to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment, the claimed invention has the ability to ingest media files and data, prepare them for transmission across the media industry, localize all the applicable data by customer and track, and reconcile the distribution of that data, all within the same system.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the structure of the system <b>100</b> includes a series of components and functions. The first component is for asset ingestion into the system. Digital files and associated data are entered into the system in a variety of ways such as through standard file transfer protocol (FTP) or satellite transmission over a satellite link such as an outgoing satellite link <b>190</b> used for distribution. This data is then scanned for compliance to formats, quality, and expected parameter values, process block <b>150</b>. The expected parameter values that are specific to each content provider are stored in provider tables <b>170</b>, wherein the system compares the stored provider specific expected parameter values to those received with each media asset. Media package specific expected parameters are stored in package tables <b>504</b>, wherein the system further compares those package specific expected parameters to the parameter values received with each media asset. To the extent that any parameters need to be added or are missing, the system calculates those parameter values based on data stored in metadata tables <b>516</b>. Such calculated metadata may be archived into an archive table <b>176</b> for later review, or backup.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The digital files are then transformed into customer-specific formats, a process that begins at process block <b>152</b>. In a package determination process, the metadata of the media file is processed and added to the file. The system <b>100</b> has the unique ability to be ingestion-format agnostic, meaning that, however the content provider would like to enter files into the system, it can recognize the interface type automatically, and perform the appropriate protocol to ingest the file, process block <b>154</b>. The data is then queued, process block <b>156</b>, and scheduled for transmission over any medium (e.g. over the satellite link <b>190</b>, the Internet, and such), and prepared for that transmission. Before distribution, reporting information regarding each file to be transmitted is stored in transformed asset tables <b>159</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The actual distribution is then performed, process block <b>158</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> transmission of the media files <b>190</b> occurs via satellite <b>190</b> through a communication server <b>160</b>, to docking stations <b>186</b> at the recipient site head ends. After distribution, the media files are tracked, reconciled, and reported on, through a network management system (NMS) <b>188</b>. This comprehensive approach enables any one area of the system <b>100</b> to affect properties and functionality of any or all of the other components, and to optimize the entire end-to-end performance of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The system <b>100</b> enables users to author metadata (the control and information file for digital files in the video on demand environment) for video assets and export them for use. In one embodiment, the metadata affects the transmission of the media assets from content providers to recipient sites, such as multiple system operators (MSOs) receiving video-on-demand content. The system also performs gateway functionality, which in the context of one embodiment, includes aggregation of files from multiple transmission systems through one point of entry. This comprehensive control gives the system the unique capability of allowing any and all formerly disparate or disconnected functions of the distribution chain to interact with each other, thereby optimizing all functions and capabilities of the entire network and allowing file handling based on data from the entire distribution system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one sense, the system <b>100</b> functions as an automated file recipient system for content distributors to aggregate data and digital media files. These media files are ingested into the system <b>100</b> through an automated ingest subsystem, processing block <b>104</b>. Once received the media files are manipulated and scheduled for distribution to the recipient sites or customers of the content providers, such as local cable companies and the like. The system <b>100</b> also allows those same content providers to author the parameter data for their media files directly through a provider remote interface sever (PRI) <b>120</b>. In one embodiment, the parameter data is edited directly into the system or provided pre-formed into a folder on the network in order to be automatically ingested with the media file. Once entered, this parameter data is immediately transformed into data specific to the content recipient sites that will receive it later.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In another sense, the system <b>100</b> provides the ability for all the customers to view the media file and status data through the Internet at all points in the distribution chain, using an affiliate remote interface server (ARI) <b>122</b>. The customers can log into the system over the web through the ARI <b>122</b>, and view relevant media file data, not only in the original form in which it was entered, but also in the form after transformation in the system. For example, with respect to program guide data, parameter data can be viewed in a form, as it will appear when recipients display it to their cable or media viewers.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one example, a content provider logs into the system to view the properties of their media file that are provided to a recipient, for example, a cable MSO. These properties include the price for viewing the media file from the affiliate, times or available times for viewing the media file, overrides to certain values found in the control metadata, such as provider or distributor information, and financial information, such as revenue splits. The providers can also view the interface the content recipients display to their viewers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an example screen shot from PRI <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The media recipients can log in through the ARI <b>122</b>, and can also review content available in the system. Through the ARI <b>122</b>, media recipients can sign up to receive content, thereby added the media recipient to distribution lists for media files. The recipients can also view the media file content before making decision on which media files to receive. An example screen from the ARI <b>122</b> used to perform these functions is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, an example scenario with respect to ingestion and processing of a media file follows. At a network connection <b>106</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a file first arrives at an ingestion server <b>108</b> without any manual intervention. The network connection <b>106</b> preferably comprises any high speed internet connection, such as a T1, T2 or high-end DSL connection. The ingestion server <b>108</b> reads the file's parameters, which are entered by the content provider, and the type of file is determined.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">After initially receiving the media file, in one embodiment, a media file manager <b>512</b> manages processing of the file. For example, the media manager <b>512</b> can determine that the parameters of a media file require it to move immediately to the front of a satellite distribution queue, process block <b>156</b>. The parameters read are a part of the corresponding metadata received with the file from the content provider. Certain fields are present in that data, such as the content tier, which tells the system the file type, which defines processing rules that are applied to the file in process block <b>154</b>. In this step, parameters related to one or more contracts between the recipient and the content provider are added to the aggregate file, as described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-12</figref>. The contract parameters may be determined from contract data in financial/contract tables <b>172</b>. At that time, financial reports regarding the file are calculated and stored in a financial reporting module <b>174</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Since, in this example, the parameters indicate that immediate processing is necessary, the file is then moved across an internal system <b>100</b>, transmitted immediately, and reported on immediately so that all the recipient sites have it as quickly as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In another example, a media file that arrives late automatically triggers a change in any previously scheduled transmission date within its parameters. This change flows through the entire system where parameters for that media file are kept. The system changes the availability date for that media file within its associated metadata. That change affects any financial projections, which are also automatically figured from the same data.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Further in another example, a change in receiving status/capability of one of the remote recipient sites triggers a change in the expected transmission schedule should that recipient site be part of an upcoming scheduled distribution. This status affects the transmission order and timeline, and the changes populate back through the system. For example, should a number of recipient sites be unable to receive the media file at the time they are intended to receive transmission from the distribution, the system automatically changes the schedule for distribution according to one or more set of rules. The schedule may be changed to the next immediate distribution, or a distribution that occurs the next hour or later to allow those sites change to a favorable receiving status. With this feature of automated transmission, time updating has the effect of optimizing the use of transmission making the system more efficient.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">If there is an automatic parameter change, such as in the examples regarding time of transmission described above, other subsystems in the claimed system, such as a contract management subsystem, determine rules for proceeding and adjust data surrounding the media file accordingly. For example, the contract management rules might require the media file to be sent to a recipient site regardless of the receiving status of the recipient site. Alternatively, a rule may define the latest date that a media file may be sent. In that case, similarly, if the latest send-date indicates that the media file cannot be delayed any longer, the media file is required to be sent regardless of the receiving status of the target recipient site in the distribution. Content providers viewing data in the system see these changes in real time and related report data is also changed applicably.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Changes can also be made manually. If parameters for a media file are changed by one of the content providers or recipient sites through the PRI <b>120</b> or the ARI <b>122</b>, the changes can be made anywhere in the distribution chain, including post transmission, because all of the subsystems are integrated. If distribution for the media file has already occurred, an updated media file recipient sites remote locations. This means that the content provider can change the availability dates for an individual media file by logging onto the web, pulling up the data for that particular media file, changing the availability dates, and the system will change the availability dates not only within the system <b>100</b> itself, but also at all at the file's destinations. The system sends updated copies of the media file if necessary (over satellite, internet etc.) to perform the updates. Users at the recipient sites can also change data surrounding that asset and the same functions will apply. The system also has rules that allow the content providers to change certain data such as availability windows for the media file, but the recipient sites are allowed to change other data that is applicable to their specific systems, such as price. The identification of which entities are allowed to change which parameter fields can be stored as additional parameters in the media file itself.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">This end-to-end visibility and system interoperability enables the system to affect any asset at any part of the distribution and management chain. The claimed system is the only asset management system with this scope and combination of functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">One of the functions of the system <b>100</b> includes interactive program guide (IPG) metadata authoring. Some prior systems enable users to author IPG metadata, but only the claimed system <b>100</b> enables entities to see exactly what that IPG metadata will look like at the eventual content recipient sites system immediately. In addition, the recipient site can see what their IPG content looks like on their own system even before the media file arrives. This is because the system takes the content provider's data and transforms it into recipient site-specific data immediately upon ingestion in process blocks <b>150</b>-<b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one preferred embodiment, the system includes a multicast asset data packaging subsystem and method, which is part of the package determination process <b>152</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a single media file <b>400</b> is used for distribution to two or more recipient sites. A first recipient site has first parameter requirements for processing the media file <b>400</b>, and a second recipient site has second parameter requirements for processing the media file <b>400</b> that are different from the first parameter requirements. A first set of parameters <b>404</b> is included in the media file that meets the first parameter requirements. Further, a second set of parameters <b>408</b> is included in the media file <b>400</b> that meets the second parameter requirements. In this regard, the first set of parameters <b>404</b> are for use during distribution to the first recipient site, and the second set of parameters <b>408</b> are for use during distribution to the second recipient site. Similarly, a third set of parameters <b>412</b> is included in the file to meet the parameter requirements of a third recipient site. Each of the first <b>404</b>, second <b>408</b> and third <b>412</b> sets of parameters are each identified by customer identifiers <b>402</b>, <b>406</b> and <b>410</b> respectively in the media file <b>400</b>. The media file <b>400</b> includes a main body portion, wherein the actual media file content <b>450</b> is stored for eventual presentation in a recipient site viewing system.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In this sense, the system <b>100</b> has the ability to superset (combine multiple media files into one larger multicast file encompassing all the data of the disparate media files) customized metadata for a recipient site, as well as delivery and interface parameters into a single media file <b>400</b>. To multicast means using a single transmission of a digital file to multiple reception points simultaneously. The claimed system allows a multicast channel to be used in a more efficient manner, and to centralize coordination of all remote recipient site requirements. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the system also allows a single docking station <b>186</b> to offload files to a discrete list of destinations without having to send the media file <b>400</b> to all of those destinations.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">This structure of the media file <b>400</b> allows for use of a method of distribution whereby the same file is sent to all applicable receiving sites at the same time. In one embodiment, the media file <b>400</b> is a media or digital file for use in video playback, gaming or any other digital file. This file <b>400</b> is sent over a satellite link (<b>190</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the Internet, or the like, from the central system <b>100</b> to a local server. It arrives on that server and is moved to a server for a receiving customer when a data control file arrives for the media file <b>400</b>. The data parameters and/or files required by each site are built into one aggregate media file <b>400</b>. Each section of that file <b>400</b> is targeted for a specific receive site, thereby keeping the localizing functionality, but requiring only one media file <b>400</b> to be sent over the multicast. The receiving site's equipment need know only the site's unique customer identifier <b>402</b>, <b>406</b> or <b>410</b> in order to extract the proper parameter data set for its use.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In this since, the data within the media file <b>400</b> is customizable by recipient site. For example, the price of the media file <b>400</b> or menu location being used by the on-screen guide can be recipient site-specific for each receiving recipient customer site. Further, the media file <b>400</b> itself can appear to have multiple formats (XML, iTV, or any other widely accepted digital format), even though the specific format of the file as used by a recipient site is part of the larger aggregate of the file <b>400</b>, thereby enabling interaction with any format of receiving site.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The media file <b>400</b> also contains, for each recipient site as part of the parameters <b>404</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>412</b>, interface and delivery specifications unique to each recipient site. Examples include the specific IP address for each recipient site's video server, the interface protocol required at that site (ADI, WINDOWS&#xae;, FTP), the version of metadata file required at that particular site (XML, iTV), and how the media file <b>400</b> should be processed after it is transferred from the central system <b>100</b> to the receiving customer (e.g., delete immediately, stay on the system server for 24 hours etc.) as indicated by the parameters <b>404</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>412</b>. This information tells the recipient sites how to react to, and act on, each file <b>400</b> it is receiving individually. This enables recipients to be unrestricted in their interactive behavior since the site itself no longer requires parameters to be set within it, but rather can adopt asset-specific parameters each time a file <b>400</b> arrives because of the control information contained within that file <b>400</b> by virtue of the parameters <b>404</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>412</b>. This enables functions such as prioritizing files, wherein a media file <b>400</b> can be prioritized so that it jumps ahead in the sequence of transfer to the server it will reside on if it is a time-sensitive title. Or, the system enables a site to change the delivery address of its video on demand (VOD) server without having to stop the system <b>100</b> from offloading while it is reconfigured, since the parameter information is in each title as it arrives. This parameter information <b>404</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>412</b> is contained in the header of each data file <b>400</b>, and is populated by the system each time a file <b>400</b> is built for distribution. This enables a receiving server to receive located at a site-specific control information on a file-by-file basis without that information having to be stored in the recipients data file, which, in some cases would violate industry standards. The header is stripped off the file before storage in the file to the recipient site's system.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">This aggregation of the site-specific media data and delivery properties also has the effect of making a change at the centralized asset management system instantaneously applicable to any, or all, remote receiving and distribution sites without having to configure files for each site individually, or at the recipient site equipment itself.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one embodiment, software is used to implement the asset data packaging subsystem to create the media file <b>400</b>. With reference back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the steps performed by the software and the flow of data through the system components are illustrated. At process block <b>104</b> generalized metadata control file is ingested into the system for each media file <b>400</b> that the system is expected to distribute to customers. This control file contains information specific to the media file <b>400</b> itself and, as such, is not specific to any recipient customer needs. At process block <b>150</b> this control file is transmitted by the system and checked against expected values that the media file <b>400</b> is allowed to have (e.g., ESPN would not be allowed to enter into the system titles with an &#x201c;X&#x201d; rating), and the values are all normalized, that is, transformed into values the system can recognize and can key other functions off of. At process block <b>152</b>, the media file <b>400</b> is then run through a series of transformations, one for every customer recipient site it will be transmitted to. The parameters are stored as site-specific data for each of those customers in the media file <b>400</b>. At process block <b>154</b>, by way of example, and not by way of limitation, these transformations include changing any provider-specific information, such as a product type, into a value desired by the recipient, applying the recipient site's correct price and royalty information, applying the correct content category, and transforming the raw data itself into the type of file each recipient site requires as each of their servers may be built on different operating systems.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When transmission occurs, the finalized information for each recipient site is aggregated into one file <b>400</b> containing the data and applicable file structure for every site to which it will be transmitted. The media file <b>400</b> is built as a contiguous series of these site-specific control files, or sets of parameters <b>404</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>412</b>, each in the recipient's own site-specific format, containing site-specific control information and control data. At process block <b>158</b> this file <b>400</b> is subsequently queued, process block <b>156</b>, and transmitted to each recipient. At each recipient site, the file <b>400</b> is searched for the applicable site-specific section(s). For each recipient site, the relevant section is extracted and stripped of any encompassing transmission-only control data portions. This leaves only the relevant file information in the proper format for each specific site, ready to be processed.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this process, the remote site devices at the recipient sites need only know their assigned customer identifiers <b>402</b>, <b>406</b>, <b>410</b> in order to search the aggregate file for the recipient's relevant section and to extract the right parameters they will use to process the media file <b>400</b>. This allows the control data for every distributed device to be modified and controlled at the centralized system, eliminating the need for data to be kept on remote servers or for extensive configuration changes to occur before transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one embodiment, the claimed invention is a system and method for automated validation of a media file <b>400</b> for distribution. A media file <b>400</b> having an asset type is received for distribution. It is validated according to one or more requirements for the asset type. As a result of the validation process, one or more errors typically are produced. These errors are corrected by applying a rules application to the media file. The media file <b>400</b> is then distributed.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in one embodiment, processing and validation includes polling (process block <b>104</b>), parsing, validating, normalizing, rules application, error checking (process block <b>150</b>), package determination (process block <b>152</b>), site-specific data transformation (process block <b>156</b>), scheduling (process block <b>156</b>), transmission (process block <b>158</b>), and finally, reconciliation and tracking of the media file <b>400</b>. In one embodiment, the system <b>100</b> receives the media files <b>400</b> by polling. Polling is the automated receipt and scanning of content into the system. The system constantly signals all points on its network to determine if a media file has been input to any of them. If any media files <b>400</b> are found for input, the system downloads them, at process block <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Parsing is the automated determination of the file type for each media file <b>400</b> coming into the system, and the application of the proper procedures to that media file based on the file type. Validation is the determination of whether the incoming parameter data values and asset types match the expected incoming parameter data values and asset types based on certain criteria such as the inputting party or file format. The system also checks for file-specific required constructs in the incoming data such as allowable lengths, time formats (24 hours vs. 12 hours) and ID structures such as Cablelabs requirements of 20-digit ID values.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Normalization means taking the validated incoming data and transforming it into system-specific formats and values so the data can be acted upon further by the system <b>100</b>. For example, date transformations occur for the recipient sites to provide a baseline from which to transform the media file <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A rules application processes the media file <b>400</b> through a complex rules engine that is specific to the system <b>100</b> that enables the system <b>100</b> to set parameters and to format the media file <b>400</b> as necessary for further distribution to receiving customers. As an example of this rules application process, if a specific set of data contains specific values in certain fields, the accompanying file is priced at a certain level at some recipient sites but not at others. If a media file <b>400</b> enters the system priced at $2.99 instead of, $3.99 from a particular movie studio, the system determines that the media file <b>400</b> is a &#x201c;special&#x201d; title for example, a higher standard price such as and therefore changes the data set it applies to the media file for the recipient sites. Some of the receiving sites might elect to make any media file available the standard price via their cable system, but others might decide to follow the lead of the studio and price the title at the special price.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In another example, a rule can be used to define that, if a certain content provider refuses to populate certain fields within the metadata, such as the content package description, the system uses other mandatory fields, such as the provider name and price, to analyze the media file, for example, divine that the package must be a specific package from a certain provider. The system <b>100</b> then has the ability to run normal receiving site transformations on the media file <b>400</b> for distribution. In summary, the rules engine applies intelligent rules to the data once it has been validated and normalized as the first part of ingestion.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the process of error checking, the system <b>100</b> determines whether the incoming media file <b>400</b> is free of errors and unexpected values, and therefore whether the media file is ready to be approved for processing.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the process of package determination, at process block <b>152</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each media file <b>400</b> is assigned to a specific content package based on parameters in the media file's metadata. This assigned package determines the distribution list for that media file <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The process of site-specific data transformation, a process block <b>154</b>, transforms the media file <b>400</b> into data requested by each recipient site in order to be applicable to their system-specific hardware, software, marketing wishes, and such.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in one embodiment, the claimed invention is a system and method for automated determination of priority in processing a media file <b>400</b> for distribution to a recipient site. A media file <b>400</b> is received for distribution, at process block <b>140</b>. The media file <b>400</b> is processed to produce data parameters for distribution, process block <b>150</b>. As part of the processing step <b>150</b>, a receiving status of the recipient site is checked. One or more of the data parameters are changed according to the receiving status of the recipient site. For example, according to one embodiment, the data parameters are changed according to a set or rules defined in a contract with the recipient site. The media file <b>400</b> is then distributed to the recipient site according to the data parameters. Further, an interface is provided so as to allow the recipient site personnel to view status information regarding distribution of the media file <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one embodiment, the claimed invention is a system and method for optimizing distribution of a media file <b>400</b> to a plurality of recipient sites. A receive status of a first recipient site is checked, thereby producing a first status check result. A receive status of a second recipient site is checked, thereby producing a second status check result. Based on the first check result and the second check result, a rules engine (process block <b>154</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is applied to determine a priority for distribution to the first recipient site relative to the second recipient site. The media file <b>400</b> is then distributed to the first recipient site and the second recipient site according to the determined priority.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The system <b>100</b> is the first asset management system to prioritize, reorganize and intelligently manipulate a multicast pitch, which is a single transmission of a media file <b>400</b> to multiple recipient sites simultaneously. The system transmits media files <b>400</b> over a satellite or Internet protocol data network based on a schedule. The schedule is derived based on when the need of the media file <b>400</b> is to be transmitted to the recipient sites. This transmission is a multicast transmission to a pre-determined combination of destinations, each with varying ability to receive media files <b>400</b> based on the equipment status at each recipient site. One unique feature of the system <b>100</b> is its ability to optimize distribution efficiency by accounting for these status changes across its network and then reconciling those status changes with intelligent rules.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">For example, if a recipient site in a distribution list for a specific multicast transmission of a media file <b>400</b> is not functioning at the time transmission is scheduled for that media file, the system <b>100</b> applies intelligent rules to determine whether that transmission requires alteration. In one embodiment, one of those rules defines a minimum percentage of recipient sites that must have a &#x201c;good&#x201d; receive status before allowing transmission of the media file. The system's automated decision-making process takes into account whether a non-functional recipient site has not received the media file <b>400</b>. The media file <b>400</b> can be retransmitted to that recipient site later. Alternatively, the system may delay the entire transmission for a set period of time. These decisions are based on rules derived from individual recipient sites (e.g., ability to receive files at that moment) and asset properties (e.g., time left before the specific asset is required to be transmitted to its customer base), as well as other relevant states (e.g., transmission speed, quality of the channel).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In one embodiment, another circumstance that causes a status change to the media file <b>400</b> is the manual alteration of the transmission schedule. The system <b>100</b> determines whether the change will have an undesired effect on another transmission or file status for a different media file <b>400</b>. Additionally, the system can predict when future transmission problems may occur, by calculating the performance of network components (e.g., bandwidth, speed, current transmission load), or anticipating upcoming requirements that may cause transmission failures. If a problem is predicted, the system adjusts the schedule accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a transmission specific flow diagram is shown that illustrates the data flow in performing prioritization and transmission of the media files <b>400</b>. Some of the components in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with respect to the overall system. The transmission flow begins with the site-specific metadata transformer <b>500</b> passing data to the queue scheduler <b>502</b>. The queue scheduler <b>502</b> applies scheduling rules to each incoming media file <b>400</b> based on rules located in both the package tables <b>504</b> and site tables <b>506</b>. These rules include a date range for pitch, a potential time range, priority, channel requirements, and such. Once the scheduler has the pitching parameters for an individual file <b>400</b>, it passes a reference to that asset to a queue table, which will store it in a preliminary pitch order. This table is also viewable through the ARI <b>122</b> and PRI <b>120</b>, wherein users <b>560</b> can enter manual overrides, reprioritizations and re-pitches. This table is periodically scanned by the transmission controller <b>158</b>. The transmission controller <b>158</b> uses an offline queue <b>510</b> to instruct a media file manager <b>512</b> when to begin fetching media files from a media file data store <b>514</b>, and to route them to a pitch drive. The controller <b>158</b> then calls site-specific metadata tables <b>516</b> to aggregate metadata into the media files using a media file creator module <b>520</b>. When the parameters are properly packaged in the media file <b>400</b> for transmission, the final file distribution list is sent to the multicast transmission subsystem at process block <b>522</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The transmission subsystem is constantly sending and receiving status data across its network. While the system <b>100</b> is aggregating the network &#x201c;health&#x201d; information, it is applying what it finds to the list of media files <b>400</b> it has in its distribution transmission queue <b>510</b>. Each media file <b>400</b> to be distributed has site-specific parameters <b>404</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>412</b> that need to be taken into account, such as the earliest or latest it can be sent in order to meet its usability requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In another example, if the system <b>100</b> determines that a certain percentage of the receiving devices for a certain media file <b>400</b> are not on-line at the derived transmission time, the system applies that knowledge against a rules system. The system then determines if the media file <b>400</b> still has time to be delayed. It takes that information and looks at the next media file <b>400</b> in the transmission queue. If the distribution group of recipients for that media file is 100% online, it will transmit a different media file <b>400</b> instead, saving the problem media file <b>400</b> until such time as its distribution group is back on line for receiving. Alternatively, the file may need to be transmitted to whatever recipient in the distribution group is capable of capturing it due to timing constraints. This intelligence, combined with the ability to manually adjust the queue <b>156</b>, gives the system the unique ability to maximize the efficiency of its distribution bandwidth. There is a finite amount of content that can be sent in any timeframe, and the ability to transmit only when the highest percentage of targeted recipient sites can accept the media file <b>400</b> minimizes the need to retransmit files and maximizes the finite bandwidth available to the system.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in another embodiment, the claimed invention is a system and method for providing connectivity in a media file distribution system <b>100</b>. The system includes a data store <b>720</b>, a portion of which is for storing a media file <b>400</b> received from a content provider <b>702</b>. A database in the data store <b>720</b> contains editable parameters for distribution of the recipient site. The PRI <b>120</b> provides an interface to the database and allows the content provider <b>702</b> to edit the site-specific parameters <b>404</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>412</b>. The ARI <b>122</b> further allows the recipient site to edit the parameters. The distribution subsystem is configured for distributing the media file <b>400</b> according to the site-specific parameters, <b>404</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>412</b>. In one embodiment, the distribution subsystem includes connections to the Internet <b>10</b> and/or to a satellite communications link <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The system allows customers at either usage end&#x2014;i.e., receiving sites providers <b>702</b> and&#x2014;the unique ability to view, edit and assign parameters <b>404</b>, <b>408</b> <b>412</b> to a media files <b>400</b> in either their own or the other's system. The claimed system <b>100</b> enables both content providers <b>702</b> and recipient sites to gain information relevant to their product and make relevant changes to their media files <b>400</b> within a single system. The system is implemented by receiving edits and acting on the actual source media file <b>400</b> itself.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In one example, if a content provider <b>702</b> wants to assign an approval for a certain recipient site to acquire its programming, a content provider <b>702</b> can do so remotely through the PRI <b>120</b>. If the recipient site signs up for that content, which can also be done remotely through the ARI <b>122</b>, the system <b>100</b> automatically requests parameters for assigning to the file for the recipient site (such as price, on-screen guide placement category, provider value), and it completes the transaction without any manual intervention. The content providers <b>702</b> supply information about the content, such as the parameter values with which each file will arrive (suggested price, suggested rating, and such). The receiving site can assign its desired site-specific parameters <b>404</b>, <b>408</b> <b>412</b> to the file <b>400</b> as well through the ARI <b>122</b>. The content provider <b>702</b> can display the parameter information and view exactly how the content is being offered to that particular receiving site's customers through the PRI <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Another example screen shot of the provider interface into the system <b>100</b>, the PRI <b>120</b>, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In the screen shot of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the provider is shown a list of available media packages for media files <b>400</b> stored in the data store <b>720</b>. Another example screen shot from the ARI <b>122</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In this screen, the recipient customer can enter pricing information, package name information, a product description, transmission priority, and rating information for the package, which are customizations that can be viewed, edited, and/or validated by the content provider <b>702</b> in the ARI <b>122</b> in a similar screen. In this way, because both content providers and recipient sites have access to data within the system applicable to each other, they are able to view and change the data for customization to their own systems. Content providers <b>702</b> are able to authorize a recipient site's ordering of a package containing the content provider's media file <b>400</b>, and the system eliminates the need for manual assignment of that recipient site into the transmission distribution list for the media file <b>400</b>. Given that a preferred embodiment of the ARI <b>122</b> is web-based, and runs in a standard browser window, the recipient sites are able to view and edit the metadata associated with the media file <b>400</b> over the Internet, which allows them to set the data without having to create their own separate system to do so.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In another feature of the system, when a content provider <b>702</b> submits content into the system (i.e., the content provider <b>702</b> sends a media file along with the controlling metadata file with its appropriate asset-specific information), the media file <b>400</b> is checked against expected properties and approved for ingestion into the system, as described above. These properties and values are then, through a series of steps, modified to the individual requirements of each individual recipient site wishing to receive that content, as described above. Those site-specific values are then assigned to that recipient site within the central database in the data store <b>720</b>, and displayed to the customer prior to transmission. The recipient site has the ability to change any values prior to transmission through the ARI <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In one embodiment, the site-specific parameters <b>404</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>412</b> follow certain expected criteria and value ranges. Automated assignment of at least some of those values is triggered by the expected input values and assignment of others is triggered by the expected outbound values for the site-specific parameters <b>404</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>412</b> of the media file <b>400</b>. The system <b>100</b> allows the recipient sites to see the inbound media files <b>400</b> in order to transform it from <b>100</b> any way they see fit. The system also allows the inputting customers, i.e., the content providers <b>702</b>, to see the results of their data being transformed by the recipient sites. Since both sets of data reside within a single data store <b>720</b>, it is possible to display both sets to users at either end of the distribution chain. This gives both content providers <b>702</b> and recipient sites each more visibility into what the other is doing with their half of the distribution chain. It also gives them more control. A content provider <b>702</b> can assign contract values or on-screen display values to a particular video asset in a media file and restrict the recipient sites to which the media file is made available from changing those values. The content providers can then see the end result by looking at the actual data within the system. They can also authorize or de-authorize specific recipient sites within the system for receiving an media file <b>400</b> in the first place, simply by logging into the system and assigning parameters to their content, such as which recipients can or cannot receive particular media files <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Recipient sites can see the incoming values the content provider <b>702</b> makes available with the content providers assets and then the recipient sites can set up transformations to those assets prior to or after transmission to its own equipment. The recipient sites can stop specific media files from coming to their system if the media files for those assets contain certain data types (such as those with an &#x201c;X&#x201d; rating, and the like.). A recipient site can request certain media files if they have not already been authorized for them, and they can track the input delivery timeframes to see whether a media file will be transmitted as expected. This ability to act on the actual data inputted by the content providers means the system is the only place participating content providers and recipient sites need to view, enter and edit the parameter data, and it gives them the ability to do so at any point in time along the media file <b>400</b> asset lifecycle.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In another embodiment, the claimed invention is a system and method for providing interactive program guide entry for a media file <b>400</b>. A distribution hub (data store <b>720</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) stores a media file <b>400</b> received from a content provider <b>702</b> for distribution to a recipient site. An interface to the distribution hub (ARI <b>122</b>) allows editing of program guide data for the media file. The interface stores the program guide data as site-specific parameters <b>404</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>412</b> to the media file <b>400</b>. The interface further allows the content provider to view the program guide data for the media file <b>400</b>. In one embodiment, the interface further allows the content provider <b>702</b>, through the PRI <b>120</b>, to edit the program guide data, and to set parameters regarding editing of the program guide data by the recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>, the system has web-browser based graphical user interface (GUI) functionality. Further built in to this GUI functionality is the ability to allow entities (i.e., either content providers or recipient sites) to easily manipulate their interactive program guide (IPG), or on-screen TV set navigation guide. The interface allows the recipient to structure and map incoming media files <b>400</b> to their interface.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">For example, in one embodiment, when a viewer on a recipient site's network enters a video-on-demand (VOD) section of the recipient site's television IPG, there is a hierarchical menu through which to navigate via the remote control organizing all of the video files by category. The recipient site (e.g., cable company or telephone company.) maps every asset it receives on its video-on-demand VOD servers to an IPG menu location prior to the asset's arrival within its system, and the data files accompanying each digital file preferably contain this information. The claimed system graphically links the content provider <b>702</b> and recipient site's IPG. This enables the recipient site to do the manually intensive mapping process on an easily manipulated graphic user interface, available in the ARI <b>122</b>. Through the same interface, the system also provides the ability to link incoming content providers' menu data to IPG menu.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">A media file <b>400</b> sent by the system to a recipient has a field in the site-specific parameter <b>404</b>, which carries the hierarchical menu data that defines the destination on the recipient site's IPG. This IPG might be displayed, for example, on a television, set-top box, web page, phone or any other electronic system. The media files <b>400</b> being input into system by the content provider <b>702</b> contain a generalized value in this field, used more as a characteristic of the asset contained in the media file than an expected display value. This generalized value is transformed into a specific value for each recipient site to use in processing the media file <b>400</b> which, in one embodiment, comprises taking any expected potential incoming menu value and performing a site-specific transformation (per recipient site) on it, based on previously entered information about the recipient site's IPG. Current systems do this by taking a text menu string of incoming data and transforming it into an outgoing text string. This requires repeated entry (manual or automated depending on the systems) of the strings per each incoming type and for each recipient site. This is no longer required when using the claimed system.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, example embodiments of IPG editing screens that can be presented from the ARI <b>122</b> are shown. A graphical menu builder provides easy IPG entry into the IPG parameters <b>404</b> of the media file <b>400</b>. Recipient sites have the ability to enter, map, move, replace, delete and populate menu locations through this easily usable interactive GUI. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates the screen shown after selection of the &#x201c;Outdoor Life Network&#x201d; entry in the screen show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in another embodiment, the claimed invention is a system and method for providing a multi-port catcher <b>146</b>. The system includes a computer <b>108</b>, a data store <b>514</b> (or <b>720</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), and a network connection <b>106</b> for connecting the computer to a network. In one aspect of this embodiment, a partition application is executed on the computer <b>146</b> to partition the computer into multiple partitions. A catcher application <b>146</b> (a remote receiving computer that receives and rebuilds the transmitted files) executes in each partition. Each catcher application <b>146</b> is capable of receiving a separate media file <b>400</b> over the network connection, simultaneously. Each media file <b>400</b> is stored in the data store <b>514</b>. The system may use a plurality of catcher applications <b>146</b>, wherein, for example, a first partition executes a first catcher application <b>146</b>, and a second partition executes a second catcher application <b>146</b>. Therefore, the first catcher application <b>146</b> can use a different protocol than the second catcher application <b>146</b>. In this sense, the partition application is configured to divide processing of a processor of the computer into virtual computers, such that each of the media files <b>400</b> is received by a partition executing on one of the virtual computers.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In one embodiment, one of the partitions is configured as a content provider itself, such that one or more of the media files <b>400</b> can be provided internally from the data store into the catcher <b>146</b> without using a separate computer <b>108</b> to provide the one or more media files <b>400</b> to the catcher <b>146</b>. In this or other embodiments, one of the partitions is further configured as a gateway computer to provide gateway processing, such as SMTP <b>144</b>, FTP <b>148</b>, and/or encoding/offloading functions <b>149</b>, for each of the other partitions.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In one embodiment, the catcher <b>146</b> is implemented as a file reception server <b>800</b> located at a recipient customer location or cable head end, executing catcher partitions <b>146</b><i>a </i>and <b>146</b><i>b</i>. The system <b>100</b> allows one catcher <b>146</b> to receive multiple asset reception streams/transmissions from multiple distributors, all organized and reported on from the centralized database in the data store <b>720</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In current digital video distribution networks, a &#x201c;catcher&#x201d; has one reception path that validates and offloads the received files onto the destination server for the received files (the recipient sites equipment). The partitions <b>146</b><i>a </i>and <b>146</b><i>b </i>on the catcher <b>146</b> enable multiple, unique, exclusive reception paths for multiple transmission systems to deliver media files <b>400</b> to it. The media files <b>400</b> are treated uniquely based on their origination point, but the data is entered into the central data store <b>720</b> (by way of the catcher sending it back to the central system), giving one point of reference to the recipient site. This is unique because previously, any recipient site that required content delivered from multiple sources required multiple catchers (one per source), and a separate physical gateway to manage the multiple offloads into one destination video server. The catcher <b>146</b> of the presently claimed system is capable of not only receiving multiple inbound transmissions from different sources on the same hardware platform, but it is also capable of performing the gateway traffic management function, thereby consolidating previously disparate functions into one. The catcher <b>146</b> also includes the ability to ingest a local media file <b>400</b> without the need for it to be transmitted from a remote destination.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In order for the catcher to perform these functions, a software application executes internally in the computer to partition a single computer into multiple receiving points <b>146</b><i>a </i>and <b>146</b><i>b</i>. Each partition has the ability to execute industry standard file-movement protocols within the same computer <b>108</b>. This allows the catcher <b>146</b> to receive multiple streams from different satellite receivers, from locally introduced content over an IP network, or from another catcher <b>147</b> physically attached to the catcher <b>146</b>. The media files <b>400</b> are offloaded from the catcher <b>146</b> through one point, eliminating the need for the recipient site to put a separate gateway on the network. The media files <b>400</b> are aggregated into the centralized data store <b>720</b>, thereby allowing the recipient site to perform data manipulation and reporting from one system regardless of the origination point of the transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In one embodiment, each catcher <b>146</b><i>a</i>, <b>146</b><i>b </i>is implemented in software. This software scans both internal folders in catcher <b>146</b> and external folders on the network to which the catcher <b>146</b> is attached. These files are brought into a staging area/folder in the catcher <b>146</b>. The metadata associated with those files (which arrives with the files) is sent back through the Internet to the centralized data store <b>720</b>. With reference back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the metadata is then scanned for compliance, process block <b>150</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which includes analyzing the media file <b>400</b> to determine the identity of the content provider <b>702</b>, and normalizing the site specific parameters <b>404</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>412</b> into a standard set of values the recipient site has requested. The parameters <b>404</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>412</b> are stored into the multicast structure, and the data is re-sent to the catcher <b>146</b>. The system then moves the submitted digital file <b>400</b> off of the central data store <b>720</b> onto the recipient site's video server. Should a media file <b>400</b> that is not allowed or expected arrive on the system catcher <b>146</b> from an outside source, the file is quarantined on the catcher <b>146</b> and not moved to the central data store <b>720</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The centralization in the system allows the recipient site to view all of its digital file parameter and media data in one central place, and also allows it to use that same system to update media files <b>400</b> across the entire set of sites it owns from one place, regardless of whether or not those media files originated from the central data store <b>720</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In another embodiment, the claimed invention is a system and method for administrating a contract for distribution of a media file <b>400</b>. A media file <b>400</b> is received from a content provider <b>702</b>, after which, contract parameter data is entered into the media file <b>400</b> according to a contract between the content provider and a recipient site. Metadata is calculated for the media file <b>400</b> based on the contract parameter data, which is stored in the site-specific parameters <b>404</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>412</b> of the media file <b>400</b>. The media file <b>400</b> is then distributed to the recipient site. In one embodiment, by way of example, and not by limitation, the site-specific parameters <b>404</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>412</b> include price limitations for the price that the recipient site can charge viewers for viewing of the media file <b>400</b>. As another example, and not by limitation, the contract parameter data <b>404</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>412</b> include time limitations defining limitations regarding a time that the recipient site can present the media file <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The contract management system enables functions for the administration of a contract (between any or all of content providers, distributors, recipient sites, studios or other applicable parties) with respect to a media file <b>400</b>. By way of example, and not by limitation, these functions include a contract to derive N number of unique, site-specific financial parameters for use in multiple places within the system, and the unique use of contract entity building blocks (such as provider, receiver or distributor element) to determine financial fulfillment and processing.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, in one embodiment, at step <b>1100</b>, one entity has the option of managing contracts in one of two different ways, either by using package properties or by using site properties of the site-specific parameters <b>404</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>412</b>. Next, at step <b>1102</b>, a choice is presented to the user for selecting the level not selected in step <b>1100</b> (i.e., if the option for package properties was selected, the site properties are selected). With respect to package properties, the user can view the hierarchy of the package recipient sites sorted by MSO, and the recipient sites they each own. The recipient site of content provider <b>702</b> can then select any of these groups (the entire set of package recipient sites or any number of MSO's and/or sites) for contract creation or editing. The level to be applied is selected, which includes by package, MSO, or recipient site, at step <b>1104</b>. If the selected level doesn't have a contract already created, step <b>1106</b>, the system <b>100</b> offers the opportunity to create the contract or contracts, at step <b>1108</b>. If a recipient site group is selected and applied in bulk by using MSO or package editing, and some of the recipient sites do not yet have a site contract, then one will be created for those that do not already have one, at step <b>1110</b>. Then all recipient sites under the contract parameters are updated to reflect the choice of contract to use for the sites, at step <b>1112</b>. Otherwise, if the user chose not to create a contract when there was no contract in place for a package, MSO or recipient site, then those sites that are left without contracts are marked with an error condition in the system, step at <b>1114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In one embodiment, if additional recipient sites are added to the package, they do not automatically inherit the contract level choice made in bulk earlier by selecting MSO or Package for contract creation or editing.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In one example using the system, the user can view all packages that exist, and the packages to which a recipient site belongs. If a new package for a recipient site is selected, the user is taken to a contract application level selection screen, where the user can chose contract editing by package, MSO, or recipient site. The user can also select a package for which the recipient site is already a member, and update contract parameters. As explained above, if the newly chosen level doesn't yet have a contract created, the user is offered the choice to create the contract.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In one embodiment, after contract creation, parameter data reflecting the contract is stored in the package tables of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. When a media file <b>400</b> that is subject to the a contract is processed through the system <b>100</b>, during the package determination process <b>152</b>, the package tables are read and the appropriate parameters are inserted into the site specific parameters <b>404</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>412</b> into the media file <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, when choosing a contract level (through site properties) the system <b>100</b> shows all three potential levels, the package level <b>1200</b>, the MSO level <b>1202</b>, and the recipient site level <b>1204</b>, whether or not a contract is available on those levels. When the contract level is selected, the system displays an indicator showing whether a contract exists at that level. If a contract is created by the system, initially, a contract template <b>1206</b> is used to form the contract, after which, the contract is modifiable.</p>
