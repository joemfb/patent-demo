<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a leaf chain, particularly to a leaf chain for machinery with a high loading transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, chains are applied to transmit dynamics. With practical applied occasions, various chains with divergent types and structures are designed. For example, the leaf chain is usually applied to the occasion that requires a high driving force, such as the machinery for transmission or for hanging weighty objects.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a conventional leaf chain <b>1</b> substantially comprises a plurality of links <b>11</b> strung together. Each of the links <b>11</b> includes two aligned rollers <b>12</b>, at least one first inner plate <b>13</b> pivotally disposed on the rollers <b>12</b> (four first inner plates set of lines are adopted in the illustration), a second inner plate <b>14</b> provided between any two of the first inner plates <b>13</b>, and two outer plates <b>15</b> respectively fixed to the rollers <b>12</b> and positioned at external sides of the first inner plate <b>14</b>. Wherein, a plurality of first and second apertures <b>131</b>, <b>141</b> respectively defined on the first and the second inner plates <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> would be penetrated by the rollers <b>12</b>. Concurrently, a lubricant <b>2</b> is added within an interstice formed by each roller <b>12</b> and apertures <b>131</b>, <b>141</b> to attain the lubricating efficiency, thereby preventing the rollers <b>12</b> and the apertures <b>131</b>, <b>141</b> from abrasion and rustiness in time of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, some drawbacks exist in the conventional leaf chain <b>1</b> as follows:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">1. The lubricant <b>2</b> spreads within the interstice between the first and the second apertures <b>131</b>, <b>141</b> and the roller <b>12</b>; namely, the lubricant <b>2</b> utilizes an inherent adhesion force thereof to fill with the interstice. However, when the leaf chain <b>1</b> is applied, components contained therein are subjected to a reciprocal abrasion, thereby resulting in a soaring temperature of the lubricant <b>2</b> to decline the adhesion force thereof. Concurrently, since the first inner plate <b>13</b>, the second inner plate <b>14</b>, and the outer plate <b>15</b> adopt a loose engagement, the lubricant <b>2</b> might be undesirably released out of the interstice. As a result, the lubricating efficiency adapted to the leaf chain <b>1</b> is poor, which however influences the integral transmission stability of the leaf chain <b>1</b> and increases the abrasion rate between the rollers <b>12</b>, the first and the second inner plates <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> to accordingly reduce the service life of the same.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">2. Since the first inner plate <b>13</b> would be commonly built to a tolerance to the dimension of the aperture <b>131</b> in time of manufacturing, the contacting surface between the first inner plate <b>13</b> and the roller <b>12</b> would be somewhat uneven that unfavorably incurs a slackened engagement. Thus, when the leaf chain is operated, such slackened engagement thereof is easily subjected to collision and abrasion. A worse situation would be even brought out after the leakage of the lubricant <b>2</b>.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0009">3. A fixed engagement is merely applied between the rollers <b>12</b> and the outer plate <b>15</b>. That is, the first and the second apertures <b>131</b>, <b>141</b> of the first and the second inner plates <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> and the rollers <b>12</b> are in a pivotal engagement. Herein, if the leaf chain <b>1</b> is applied to a high-loading operation, the rollers <b>12</b> would become rotated since a twisting force applied on the roller <b>12</b> is larger than the engaging force formed on the outer plate <b>15</b> and the rollers <b>12</b>. As a result, an undesirable abrasion would be caused between the roller <b>12</b> and the outer plate <b>15</b>, thence affecting the service life of the same.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0010">Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide a leaf chain, which facilitates to prevent the lubricant contained therein from leakage, thereby conducing to a preferable lubricating efficiency and thence extending a serve life of the leaf chain.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0011">The leaf chain in accordance with the present invention mainly comprises a plurality of links connected together, each of which includes two aligned rollers, at least one first inner plate provided with apertures to pivotally receive the rollers, and two outer plates fixed to the respective rollers and respectively positioned at external sides of the first inner plate. Wherein, two spacers are respectively disposed at both peripheries of the aperture on the first inner plate and annularly disposed on the rollers so as to block a leakage of a lubricant distributed over an interstice formed between each roller and each aperture. Therefore, the inner plates and the rollers preferably avert from abrasion and rustiness, and the using life of the leaf chain could be prolonged.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0021">Before the present invention is described in greater detail, it should be noted that the like elements are denoted by the similar reference numerals throughout the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, a leaf chain <b>3</b> of a first preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a plurality of links <b>31</b> connected together, each of which includes two aligned rollers <b>32</b>, at least one first inner plate <b>33</b> pivotally disposed on the rollers <b>32</b>, and two outer plates <b>34</b> fixed to the respective rollers <b>32</b> and positioned at the external surfaces of the first inner plate <b>33</b>. Wherein, a plurality of first apertures <b>331</b> defined on the first inner plate <b>33</b> that pivotally joints the roller <b>32</b> would be penetrated by the rollers <b>32</b>. Moreover, a lubricant <b>4</b> is added within an interstice formed between each roller <b>32</b> and each aperture <b>331</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0023">Continuing with the aforementioned, a spacer <b>35</b> is disposed between the outer plate <b>34</b> and the first inner plate <b>33</b> as well as annularly disposed on each of the rollers <b>32</b>. Wherein, the material of the spacer <b>35</b> could adopt an elastic material, e.g. rubber, so that the spacer <b>35</b> could cover and seal the periphery of the aperture <b>331</b> for preventing the lubricant <b>4</b> contained therein from leaking. Moreover, when the first inner plate <b>33</b> adopts a plurality, a second inner plate <b>36</b> correspondingly disposed to the outer plates <b>34</b> is further disposed between any two of the first inner plates <b>33</b>. Wherein, the second inner plates <b>36</b> have second apertures <b>361</b> including peripheries thereof densely engaged with the rollers <b>32</b>. As it should be, the number of the first inner plate <b>33</b> could be alternatively adjusted according to the practical application. For example, the first inner plates <b>33</b> set two abreast may be adopted by a second preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, or the first inner plates <b>33</b> set four abreast may also be adopted by a third preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Herein the four first inner plates <b>33</b> are described as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, while operating the leaf chain <b>3</b>, the spacer <b>35</b> prevents the outer plate <b>34</b>, the first and the second inner plates <b>33</b>, <b>36</b> from a direct abrasion. Moreover, a periphery of the aperture <b>331</b> of the first inner plate <b>33</b> would be firmly sealed, and the lubricant <b>4</b> would not ooze from the interstice formed between the first inner plate <b>33</b> and the roller <b>32</b>. Therefore, the components contained in the leaf chain <b>3</b> would possess a preferable lubricating efficiency for providing a more stable transmission, and the first inner plate <b>33</b> as well as the roller <b>32</b> would not be subjected to wear during the operation. Moreover, since the second inner plate <b>36</b> densely engages with the roller <b>32</b>, a connective force originally provided merely by the outer plates <b>34</b> and the rollers <b>32</b> would now be enhanced. As a result, the roller <b>32</b> would not be forcedly rotated on the outer plate <b>34</b> while the loading is high, and both of the outer plate <b>34</b> and the roller <b>32</b> would not be worn away, so that the using life of the leaf chain <b>3</b> could be extended.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention comprising alike elements as those of the third preferred embodiment are herein omitted. Wherein, a sleeve <b>37</b> is disposed on each of the rollers <b>32</b> and penetrated by the first apertures <b>331</b>. Wherein, the sleeve <b>37</b> is formed by die-casting with powder metallurgy and oil; whereby, the sleeve <b>37</b> would preferably possess the lubricating performance. As it should be, the sleeve <b>37</b> could be alternatively treated by a carburization and heat treatment to reinforce the hardness thereof, so that the sleeve <b>37</b> could be averted from the abrasion well. By means of the cooperation of the lubricant (not shown) and the sleeve <b>37</b>, a contacting surface of the first inner plate <b>33</b> abutting on the roller <b>32</b> could be smooth to decrease the relationship of the mutual abrading. Therefore, the serving life of the leaf chain <b>3</b> is also prolonged.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a fifth preferred embodiment of the present invention comprising alike elements as those of the third preferred embodiment are herein omitted. Wherein, two indentations <b>332</b> are respectively defined on the borders of the aperture <b>331</b> on the first inner plate <b>33</b> for placing the spacer <b>35</b> therein. Further referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a cross-section of the spacer <b>35</b> shows a cambered face <b>351</b> and a plane face <b>352</b> formed oppositely. Preferably, the plane face <b>352</b> is placed against the indentation <b>332</b>, and the cambered face <b>351</b> is placed against the outer plate <b>34</b>. Alternatively, the indentation <b>332</b> could be defined on the outer plate <b>34</b>, while the cambered face <b>351</b> is placed against the first inner plate <b>33</b>. Briefly, the plane face <b>352</b> would keep propping against the indentation <b>332</b>. Herein this embodiment, the indentation <b>332</b> is defined on the first inner plate <b>33</b>. By means of the indentation <b>332</b>, the first inner plate <b>33</b> would not directly rub against the outer plate <b>34</b>, so that the leaf chain <b>3</b> would not displace from its original position. Moreover, since the cambered face <b>351</b> is designed by an arc, a contact area between the spacer <b>35</b> and the outer plate <b>34</b> could be decreased to prevent a twisting force directly acting on the spacer <b>35</b> while both of the first inner plate <b>33</b> and the outer plate <b>34</b> are twisted. As a result, the spacer <b>35</b> would not facilely sustain deformation to affect the sealing efficiency thereof, and the lubricant <b>4</b> received within the first inner plate <b>33</b> and the roller <b>32</b> could be well preserved for attaining a preferable lubricating capability.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0027">To sum up, the present invention takes advantages of a spacer being respectively provided at the apertures on the first inner plate included by each link. Firmly covering the apertures, the spacer impedes the friction from the first inner plate against the outer plate, and a lubricant within the inner plate and the roller could be well preserved to be excluded from a leakage during the operation. Therefore, a preferable lubricating efficiency is achieved, and a serious worn-out condition is lessened to favorably extend the serving life of the leaf chain.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0028">While we have shown and described the embodiment in accordance with the present invention, it should be clear to those skilled in the art that further embodiments may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
