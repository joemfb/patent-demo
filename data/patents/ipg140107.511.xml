Brake mechanism <b>27</b> is located beneath the head end of patient support <b>10</b> and brake mechanism <b>28</b> is located in the middle of subframe <b>14</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, brake mechanisms <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> prevent patient support <b>10</b> from rolling on castors <b>26</b> by lowering brake pads <b>32</b> and <b>50</b> to contact the floor. Brake mechanism <b>27</b> includes crossmember <b>29</b>, actuators <b>36</b>, links <b>30</b> and <b>38</b>, springs <b>34</b>, couplers <b>40</b>, and brake pads <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Actuators <b>36</b> provide the power and force necessary to raise and lower brake mechanism <b>27</b>. Actuators <b>36</b> have expandable lengths to adjust the angular position of links <b>30</b> and <b>38</b> relative to crossmember <b>29</b> so that brake pads <b>32</b> can be raised and lowered. Each of actuators <b>36</b> may be a conventional hydraulic cylinder having respective cylinder bodies, cylinder rods, and pumps to supply fluid pressure to extend and/or retract the cylinder rods relative to the cylinder bodies.

Links <b>38</b> are pivotally coupled on a lower end to couplers <b>40</b> by fasteners <b>35</b>. Links <b>38</b> are pivotally coupled on an upper end to crossmember <b>29</b> by fasteners <b>46</b>.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">To lower brake pads <b>32</b> to contact the floor, a caregiver actuates a controller that controls actuators <b>36</b>. The controller may be actuated by depressing a button located on the siderail, an endboard, or a pendant controller. As actuators <b>36</b> extend, links <b>38</b> pivot about fasteners <b>46</b> in a downward direction. As links <b>38</b> move downward, couplers <b>40</b> which pivot about fasteners <b>35</b> are moved downward also. Coupler <b>40</b> moves links <b>30</b> downward also. Links <b>30</b> and <b>38</b> form a four-bar linkage and are substantially parallel to each other so that coupler <b>40</b> maintains a position parallel to the floor through the full range of motion of coupler <b>40</b>. Links <b>30</b> and <b>38</b> are coupled along a vertical axis an equal vertical distance apart from one another on each end. For example, if the vertical distance between fasteners <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> on crossmember <b>29</b> is three inches, the vertical distance between fasteners <b>33</b> and <b>35</b> on coupler <b>40</b> is also three inches. Brake pad <b>32</b> which is coupled to the bottom side of coupler <b>40</b> is also parallel to the floor. Brake pad <b>32</b> must contact the floor with sufficient force to prevent patient support <b>10</b> from rolling on castors <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">To release brake mechanism <b>27</b>, i.e., return brake pads <b>32</b> to their retracted position, actuators <b>36</b> are illustratively activated to move from their extended positions to their retracted positions.

Brake pads <b>32</b> are returned to the retracted position by removing the pressure or extending force from actuators <b>36</b>. When the pressure or power to actuators <b>36</b> is discontinued springs <b>34</b> return couplers <b>40</b> to the retracted position.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In one embodiment of the present invention, there are three brake assemblies. In addition to brake mechanism <b>27</b> which includes two brake assemblies, subframe <b>14</b> also includes brake mechanism <b>28</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>. Brake mechanisms <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> are illustratively interconnected to provide simultaneous braking of bed <b>10</b>. Brake mechanism <b>28</b> is situated longitudinally within subframe <b>14</b> compared to the horizontal positioning of brake mechanism <b>27</b> within subframe <b>14</b>. Brake mechanism <b>28</b> includes similar components and functions similarly to brake mechanism <b>27</b>. Actuator <b>62</b>, which has an extendable length, is pivotally coupled on one end to subframe <b>14</b> by fastener <b>68</b> and pivotally coupled on the other end by fastener <b>60</b> to link <b>58</b>. Link <b>58</b> is pivotally coupled on a lower end to coupler <b>52</b> with fastener <b>55</b> and pivotally coupled on an upper end to support <b>70</b> with fastener <b>64</b>. Link <b>54</b> is also pivotally coupled on a lower end to coupler <b>52</b> and pivotally coupled on an upper end to support <b>70</b>. Actuator <b>62</b> is pivotally coupled by fastener <b>60</b> to link <b>58</b> between its upper and lower ends. Spring <b>56</b> is coupled to fastener <b>68</b> on one end and coupler <b>52</b> by fastener <b>53</b> on the opposing end. Brake pad <b>50</b> is coupled to coupler <b>70</b> and configured to engage the floor. Together, cross member <b>29</b>, links <b>54</b> and <b>58</b>, and coupler <b>52</b> form a conventional four-bar linkage.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">To lower brake pad <b>50</b> to the floor, actuator <b>62</b> is extended to force link <b>58</b> in a downward direction.

Links <b>58</b> and <b>54</b> are coupled along a vertical axis an equal vertical distance apart from one another on each end. For example, if the vertical distance between fasteners <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> on support <b>70</b> is three inches, the vertical distance between fasteners <b>55</b> and <b>53</b> on coupler <b>52</b> is also three inches. Actuator <b>62</b> exerts sufficient force on link <b>58</b> to prevent patient support <b>10</b> from rolling on castors <b>26</b> when brake mechanism <b>28</b> is used in conjunction with brake mechanism <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">To retract brake pad <b>50</b> from the floor, actuator <b>62</b> ceases supplying the extending force which provides the downward force applied by brake pad <b>50</b>. In the one embodiment, where the actuator is a hydraulic cylinder, the fluid pressure supplied to the cylinder must be discontinued to allow brake pad <b>50</b> to retract. When actuator <b>62</b> is deactivated spring <b>56</b>, which is biased to retract coupler <b>52</b> from the floor, will provide sufficient force to raise coupler <b>52</b> to a retracted position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, actuator <b>62</b> could also include an electric motor and gear system or any other suitable device as discussed above.</p>

As actuators <b>508</b> simultaneously retract frame <b>12</b>, frame channels <b>512</b> slide on plates <b>520</b> and frame <b>12</b> rolls on wheels <b>26</b> toward the foot end of patient support <b>10</b> until the actuators <b>508</b> are fully retracted.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44-46</figref>, bed <b>10</b> can be configured so that back section <b>242</b> and head section <b>240</b> lie in a substantially flat position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, or an inclined position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>, or any position in between. Back section <b>242</b> is pivotally coupled to deck frame <b>554</b> by hinge <b>548</b>. Back section <b>242</b> is raised to an inclined position as arm <b>550</b> is pivoted from a substantially horizontal position to a substantially vertical position and moves down the back side of back section <b>242</b>. When back section <b>242</b> is in the substantially flat position, back section <b>242</b> is supported by frame deck <b>554</b>, and arm <b>550</b> lies below back section <b>242</b> in a substantially flat position. Actuator <b>556</b> provides the power and force necessary to raise arm <b>550</b>. Actuator <b>556</b> has an expandable length to extend or raise arm <b>550</b> from a substantially flat position to a substantially perpendicular position. In one embodiment, actuator <b>556</b> is a conventional hydraulic cylinder having a respective cylinder body, a cylinder rod, and a pump to supply fluid pressure to extend the cylinder rod relative to the cylinder body. The cylinder body of actuator <b>556</b> is pivotally coupled to frame deck <b>554</b>. The cylinder rod of actuator <b>556</b> is pivotally coupled to arm <b>550</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Roller <b>558</b> is illustratively coupled to the end of arm <b>550</b>. Roller <b>558</b> is coupled in a manner such that it rotates freely about an axis. Roller <b>558</b> is positioned to contact the back side of back section <b>242</b>. When actuator <b>556</b> is extended, arm <b>550</b> is raised, and roller <b>558</b> forces back section <b>242</b> to pivot upward on hinge <b>548</b> as roller <b>558</b> rolls up the back side of back section <b>242</b>. Back section <b>242</b> is lowered by discontinuing the extending force or relieving the pressure of actuator <b>556</b> which will allow the cylinder rod of actuator <b>556</b> to retract. As back section <b>242</b> declines arm <b>550</b> is forced into a horizontal position and the cylinder rod is forced back into the cylinder of actuator <b>556</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, back section <b>242</b> includes opening <b>561</b>. Opening <b>561</b> is covered by plate <b>560</b> which removably couples to back section <b>242</b>. Plate <b>560</b> can be removed to allow access to internal bed components for maintenance. In an alternative embodiment of the present disclosure back section <b>242</b> is continuous and does not contain opening <b>561</b> or plate <b>560</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42-44</figref>, patient support <b>10</b> includes head section <b>240</b>, which is pivotally coupled to back section <b>242</b>. Head section <b>240</b> is pivotally coupled to back section <b>242</b> by hinge <b>616</b>. Head section <b>240</b> can be pivoted and secured about hinge <b>616</b> in a variety of orientations as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45-48</figref>. Head section <b>240</b> can be positioned and secured parallel to back section <b>242</b> or inclined or declined relative to back section <b>242</b>. Head section <b>240</b> includes panel <b>600</b>, cylinders <b>602</b>, MECHLOCK braking mechanism <b>604</b>, cables <b>608</b> and <b>612</b>, release handles <b>606</b>, coupler <b>614</b>, and slotted plate <b>616</b>. Handles <b>606</b> are pivotally coupled to the back side of head section <b>240</b> on each side of head section <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Handles <b>606</b> are positioned so that the user can place his or her fingers behind one side of head section <b>240</b> and squeeze handle <b>606</b> towards the outside edge of panel <b>600</b> to move head section <b>240</b> relative to back section <b>242</b>. Cables <b>612</b> are rigidly coupled to panel <b>600</b> on one end and coupler <b>616</b> on the other end. Cables <b>612</b> include a hard outer cover which encloses a &#x201c;choke&#x201d; wire that can be moved relative to the cover. The moveable wire enclosed in cables <b>612</b> is coupled to handles <b>606</b> on one end and slotted plate <b>616</b> on the other end. Cables <b>608</b> are rigidly coupled on one end to coupler <b>614</b> and rigidly coupled on the other end to cylinders <b>602</b>. Cables <b>608</b> are very similar to cables <b>612</b> and include a hard outer cover and an enclosed wire moveable relative to the cover. The moveable wire within cables <b>612</b> is coupled on one end to slotted plate <b>616</b> and MECHLOCK braking mechanism <b>604</b> on the other end.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Coupler <b>614</b> is rigidly coupled to the back side of panel <b>600</b> and includes slotted plate <b>616</b>. Slotted plate <b>616</b> is pivotally coupled to coupler <b>614</b>. Cylinders <b>602</b> are pivotally coupled on one end to the back side of panel <b>600</b> and pivotally on the opposing end to tabs <b>610</b> of back section <b>242</b>. MECHLOCK brakes <b>604</b> are coupled to each cylinder <b>602</b>. MECHLOCK brakes <b>604</b> are biased to grip or secure the cylinder rods of cylinders <b>602</b>. When MECHLOCK brakes <b>604</b> are actuated the bias is overcome and the cylinder rods of cylinders <b>602</b> can by moved freely until the actuator is released and the bias is reapplied to grip the cylinder rods in their then-current position.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">To adjust the angle of head section <b>240</b> relative to back section <b>242</b>, the user must first actuate one of handles <b>606</b> on either side of panel <b>600</b>. As one of handles <b>606</b> is pulled towards the outside edge of panel <b>600</b>, the wire in cable <b>612</b>, which is coupled on the opposing end to slotted plate <b>616</b> of coupler <b>614</b>, is retracted. As the wire of cable <b>612</b> is retracted, slotted plate <b>616</b> which is in a default position is pivoted to a second position. When slotted plate <b>616</b> is moved to the second position, slotted plate <b>616</b> pulls or extends wires in cables <b>608</b> which are coupled to MECHLOCK brakes <b>604</b> on cylinders <b>602</b>. When the wires in cables <b>608</b> are retracted, MECHLOCK brakes <b>604</b> are actuated and the bias which holds the cylinder rods of cylinders <b>602</b> in place is overcome. Cylinders <b>602</b> can be extended or retracted freely so head section <b>240</b> can be moved to the desired position. To fix head section <b>240</b> in the desired position, the user positions panel <b>600</b> to the desired angular position and releases handle <b>606</b>. When handle <b>606</b> is released, the bias in MECHLOCK brakes <b>604</b> is reapplied so that the brakes <b>604</b> grip the cylinder rods of cylinders <b>602</b> in their current positions. The bias in MECHLOCK brakes <b>604</b> also pull or retract the wires in cables <b>608</b> which returns slotted plate <b>616</b> to the default position from the second position. When slotted plate <b>616</b> returns to the default position, the wires in cables <b>612</b> pull the actuated handles <b>606</b> back into their original positions. Coupler <b>614</b> and slotted plate <b>616</b> are configured so that when either handle <b>606</b> is actuated slotted plate <b>616</b> will actuate both MECHLOCK brakes <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49-50</figref>, mattress <b>16</b> of patient support <b>10</b> is configured to accommodate the dimension adjusting sections of patient support <b>10</b>. Mattress <b>16</b> includes an upper cover <b>700</b>, an inflatable section <b>704</b>, a middle section <b>706</b>, a base section <b>710</b>, a first extension <b>716</b>, a second extension <b>714</b>, and a lower cover <b>712</b>. Inflatable section <b>704</b> is configured to fit within recess <b>705</b> of middle section <b>706</b>. Inflatable section <b>704</b> is illustratively comprised of multiple inflatable bladders. In one embodiment, the inflatable bladders are connected to a controlled gas supply. Recessed portion <b>705</b> is also configured to allow a patient's posterior side to be supported by inflatable section <b>704</b> while the patient's lateral portions are supported by the non-recessed surfaces of middle section <b>706</b>. Middle section <b>706</b> and base section <b>710</b> are generally formed from foam-like material and include a plurality of vertical openings <b>708</b>. Base <b>710</b> supports middle section <b>706</b> and also includes a plurality of vertical openings <b>708</b>. Extensions <b>714</b> and <b>716</b> in mattress <b>16</b> are included to aid patient ingress and egress into patient support <b>10</b>, specifically when patient support <b>10</b> is configured in the chair position. Bottom cover <b>712</b> is configured to couple to cover <b>700</b> to enclose base section <b>710</b>, middle section <b>708</b>, and inflatable section <b>704</b>. Cover <b>700</b> and bottom cover <b>712</b> may include a fastener such as a zipper to couple together.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Vertical openings <b>708</b>, best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>, are configured to collapse when force is applied in a horizontal direction. For example, if mattress <b>16</b> is placed on patient support <b>10</b>, siderails <b>22</b> can squeeze mattress <b>16</b> when the width of deck <b>24</b> is being made narrower. Vertical openings <b>708</b> collapse when siderails <b>22</b> retract. Extensions <b>714</b> and <b>716</b> also include vertical openings <b>708</b>. When foot section <b>252</b> is fully extended, extensions <b>714</b> and <b>716</b> fill the extended portion of foot section <b>252</b>. If foot section <b>252</b> is retracted, vertical openings <b>708</b> are collapsed as footboard <b>18</b> compresses extensions <b>714</b> and <b>716</b>.</p>
