<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a communication device, a communication control method and a communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A new communication method for enhancing the communication speed of radio communication with use of high-frequency electromagnetic waves called millimeter waves is currently under development. The wavelength of millimeter waves is 10 mm to 1 mm and the frequency of millimeter waves is 30 GHz to 300 GHz, and assignment of a channel in units of GHz is feasible in a 60-GHz band or the like, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally, millimeter waves have characteristics that they propagate more straightly and are attenuated by reflection more significantly compared to microwaves. Therefore, a radio communication path in millimeter-wave communication are mainly formed with direct waves or reflected waves reflected once or so. Millimeter waves also have characteristics that a free space propagation loss is large (an electric wave attainment distance is short). Therefore, while radio communication using millimeter waves has an advantage that space division can be performed easier than the case of using microwaves, there is an aspect that a communication distance is short.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to compensate for such a weakness of millimeter waves and make use of high-speed radio communication using millimeter waves in a larger variety of scenes, one approach is to add a directionality to antennas of transmitting and receiving devices and aim a transmitting beam and a receiving beam in the direction where a device at the other end of communication is located to thereby lengthen a communication distance. The directionality of a beam can be controlled by mounting a plurality of antennas on transmitting and receiving devices and assigning different weights to the respective antennas, for example. Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2000-307494, for example, discloses a technique of performing radio communication with millimeter waves after exchanging a control signal through a communication medium such as sound waves, infrared rays, light or the like and learning an optimum antenna directionality.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the technique of learning an optimum antenna directionality firstly changes an antenna directionality at the transmitting end each time transmitting and receiving one packet and secondary determines an optimum directionality at the receiving end according to a result of the received packet. In this case, it is necessary to transmit and receive the same number of packets as the number of beam patterns, which increases the time for learning and may cause degradation of the throughput.</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view showing an overview of a communication system <b>1</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the communication system <b>1</b> includes a communication device <b>100</b> and a communication device <b>200</b>. In this embodiment, the communication device <b>100</b> transmits a given signal, which is described later, to the communication device <b>200</b> and starts communication with the communication device <b>200</b>. The communication device <b>200</b> receives a signal transmitted from the communication device <b>100</b> and starts communication with the communication device <b>100</b>. Therefore, in this specification, the communication device <b>100</b> is referred to as a device at the transmitting end or a transmitting device, and the communication device <b>200</b> is referred to as a device at the receiving end or a receiving device, in some cases.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0066">The communication devices <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> can perform radio communication with each other in accordance with first and second communication methods. The first communication method is a communication method using electromagnetic waves such as microwaves, for example, that propagate less straightly and are attenuated by reflection less significantly compared to the above-described millimeter waves. The first communication method may be a communication method based on wireless LAN (Local Area Network) standards such as IEEE802.11a/b/g, for example. Thus, when performing radio communication in accordance with the first communication method, the communication devices <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> can communicate with each other without considering the directionality of a transmitting beam and a receiving beam. On the other hand, the second communication method is a communication method using electromagnetic waves that propagate straightly and are attenuated by reflection significantly, which are typified by the above-described millimeter waves. The second communication method may be a communication method based on VHT (Very High Throughput) standards using a 60-GHz band, for example. Thus, when performing radio communication in accordance with the second communication method, it is preferred that the communication devices <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> transmit and receive radio signals by pointing a transmitting beam and a receiving beam at the device at the other end of communication.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0067">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the communication device <b>100</b> includes an antenna <b>110</b> for transmitting and receiving radio signals in accordance with the first communication method and a plurality of antennas <b>160</b><i>a </i>to <b>160</b><i>n </i>for transmitting and receiving radio signals in accordance with the second communication method. The communication device <b>200</b> includes an antenna <b>210</b> for transmitting and receiving radio signals in accordance with the first communication method and a plurality of antennas <b>260</b><i>a </i>to <b>260</b><i>n </i>for transmitting and receiving radio signals in accordance with the second communication method. The communication devices <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> can perform so-called MIMO (Multi-Input Multi-Output) communication in accordance with the second communication method by using the plurality of antennas <b>160</b><i>a </i>to <b>160</b><i>n </i>and the plurality of antennas <b>260</b><i>a </i>to <b>260</b><i>n</i>. By adjusting weights assigned to signals transmitted and received through the respective antennas, the directionality of transmitting and receiving beams at the time of radio communication in accordance with the second communication method is controlled. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a transmitting beam Bt is directed from the communication device <b>100</b> toward the communication device <b>200</b>, for example. Further, a receiving beam Br is directed from the communication device <b>200</b> toward the communication device <b>100</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0068">The communication devices <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> may be a PC (Personal Computer), a terminal device such as a cellular phone terminal, a portable information terminal, a music player or a game terminal or a household electrical appliance such as a television set, for example. Further, the communication devices <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> may be network equipment such as a broadband router or a wireless access point. Furthermore, the communication devices <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> may be a radio communication module incorporated into such equipment, for example.</p>

According to the present embodiment, the reception start time point of the beam reference signal that is transmitted in accordance with the second communication method (e.g. using millimeter waves etc.) is determined based on the instruction signal transmitted in accordance with the first communication method (e.g. using microwaves or the like etc.). The beam reference signal is transmitted and received at the timing when the data portion omitted in the instruction signal is originally supposed to be received. Then, a parameter value for specifying an optimum beam pattern is determined based on the beam reference signal. It is thereby possible to learn optimum directionalities of transmitting and receiving beams used for radio communication in accordance with the second communication method during a time period in which one packet (e.g. RTS, CTS etc.) can be transmitted and received. Further, in this embodiment, a signal in accordance with the first communication method and a signal in accordance with the second communication method are not simultaneously transmitted, the possibility of an error caused by that signal processing in accordance with different communication methods is performed at the same time is avoided.</p>

Next, subsequent to the header portion of RTS, BTF conforming to the first communication method is transmitted from the first radio communication unit <b>320</b> of the communication device <b>500</b>. The BTF corresponds to the above-described beam reference signal.

Note that the CTS transmitted from the communication device <b>600</b> to the communication device <b>500</b> may also serve as the above-described instruction signal.

<p id="p-0170" num="0184">The first to third embodiments of the present invention are described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 21</figref>. In each embodiment, the reception start time point of the beam reference signal transmitted according to the first or second communication method is determined based on the instruction signal transmitted in accordance with the first communication method. Reception of the beam reference signal is started at the timing when the data portion omitted in the instruction signal is originally supposed to be received. Then, a parameter value for specifying an optimum beam pattern is determined based on the beam reference signal. It is thereby possible to learn optimum directionalities of transmitting and receiving beams used for radio communication in accordance with the second communication method during a time period in which one packet can be transmitted and received. Further, because a part of the circuit used for transmission and reception processing can be shared between the first and second communication methods, it is possible to suppress an increase in circuit scale and reduce manufacturing costs or reduce the device size, as in the second embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0185">It should be noted that, although a configuration of a device at the transmitting end and a configuration of a device at the receiving end are described separately for convenience of description, a communication device which has both functions of the transmitting end and the receiving end may be configured as a matter of course.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0186">Further, in this specification, the case of determining a beam pattern with a maximum received power as an optimum beam pattern in a device at the receiving end is described. Alternatively, however, a plurality of beam patterns with high received powers may be determined as candidates of a beam pattern to be used. Radio communication using millimeter waves can be thereby performed by the combined use of a plurality of beam patterns, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0187">Although preferred embodiments of the present invention are described in detail above with reference to the drawings, the present invention is not limited thereto.
