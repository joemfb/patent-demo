<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to integrated systems testing, and more particularly to integrated hard disk drive systems testing.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A system such as a hard disk drive (HDD) may include one or more chips and/or other components (chips/components) that are attached to a printed circuit board (PCB). Each of the chips/components on the PCB may interface with one or more other chips/components. The chips on the PCB may also interface with other chips and/or other components that are located off of the PCB. In addition, the chips/components on the PCB may also communicate with a host.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The PCB is designed to provide interconnections between the chips/components. As the number of chips/components and interconnections therebetween increases, the complexity of interconnecting traces on the PCB also usually increases. In some PCBs, multiple interconnect layers are required. For example, four layers are commonly required.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">After assembling the chips and/or other components on the PCB, a probe card may be used to test connectivity therebetween. Typically, vias are formed in the PCB to allow the probe card to perform testing from a back side of the PCB. However, the vias increase the cost of manufacturing the PCB. After testing connectivity, the system is booted and firmware testing is performed. The results of the firmware testing are analyzed. If the system passes the testing, the PCB can be assembled on a HDD with a relatively high reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To reduce the cost of manufacturing the PCB, the size of the PCB, the number of vias, and/or the number of interconnect layers must be reduced. The cost cutting design changes must be accomplished without decreasing reliability or reducing functionality.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A hard disk drive system includes an external interface that receives test configuration data, that transmits test result data, and that transmits and receives application data. The hard disk drive system includes a system on chip (SOC) that includes a controller and a read/write channel that communicates with the controller and that includes an integrated system test (IST) module that communicates with the external interface. A memory module communicates with the SOC and includes memory and an IST module. The hard disk drive system includes a spindle/voice coil motor driver module that includes an IST module. At least one of the IST modules is a master IST module that receives the test configuration data and that configures the IST modules for testing at least one of the controller, the read/write channel, and the memory module.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In other features, the testing includes loopback testing. The loopback testing can include test loops having different paths.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In other features, at least one of the IST modules includes a pattern generator that generates a predetermined pattern of test data. At least one of the IST modules can further include a pattern comparator that receives test data from at least one of the controller, read/write channel, and the memory module. The pattern comparator compares the data to the predetermined pattern of test data.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In other features, at least one of the IST modules includes a solder joint testing module. The solder joint testing module can include a pulse generator that applies a predetermined pulse to a pin of the SOC and a receiver that receives a resultant waveform from the pin. The solder joint testing module can include a comparator that compares a parameter of the resultant waveform to at least one predetermined parameter. The comparator can include a digital signal processor (DSP).</p>

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that provide the described functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a hard disk drive system <b>100</b> is shown to include a processor <b>110</b> that performs data and/or control processing. The processor <b>110</b> executes instructions that are stored in a boot ROM <b>108</b>. The processor <b>110</b> can also include an analog-to-digital converter <b>112</b>. A controller <b>114</b> transmits and receives application data with an interface <b>118</b> of a host device <b>120</b> via an interface <b>124</b>. The interface <b>124</b> can be a standard type established by industry. By way of non-limiting example, these types include serializing/deserializing (SERDES) types such as serial advanced technology attachment (SATA), integrated device electronics (IDE), fiber channel (FC), serial attached SCSI (SAS), secure digital input/output (SDIO), universal serial bus (USB), multimedia cards (MMC), high-speed multimedia cards (HS-MMC), advanced technology attachment (ATA), or other interface. The controller <b>114</b> also transmits and receives data, write data and control data to a read/write channel <b>130</b>. The read/write channel sends write data to and receives read data from a preamplifier <b>140</b> that includes one or more write amplifiers <b>142</b> and one or more read amplifiers <b>144</b>. One or more control signal lines <b>145</b> connect the read/write channel <b>130</b> to the preamplifier <b>140</b> in addition to differential read and write channels. In some implementations, the processor <b>110</b>, the controller <b>114</b> and the read/write channel <b>130</b> are implemented as a system on chip (SOC) <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The SOC <b>150</b> is attached to a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>154</b>. A memory module <b>156</b> is used to buffer data during operation, store control data, etc. A power circuit <b>158</b>, which may be an integrated circuit, controls the supply of power to other components of the hard disk drive system <b>100</b>. A spindle/voice coil motor (VCM) driver <b>162</b>, which may be part of an integrated circuit, receives control signals from the controller <b>114</b> and outputs drive signals to a voice coil motor (VCM) <b>164</b> and/or a spindle motor <b>166</b>. One or more decoupling capacitors may be connected to components of the HDD system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the HDD system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown in further detail. Components of the HDD system <b>100</b> are shown to include integrated system testing (IST) modules. Depending upon the configuration and/or interconnection of components within the HDD system and/or the type of testing that is desired, some of the components may include master components and/or slave components.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">For example, the controller <b>114</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is designated a master test component and includes a master IST module <b>200</b>. Since the controller <b>114</b> is connected to all of the remaining components of the HDD system <b>100</b>, the remaining components include slave IST modules. In particular, the processor <b>110</b> includes a slave IST module <b>204</b>, the read/write channel <b>130</b> includes a slave IST module <b>210</b>, the memory <b>154</b> includes a slave IST module <b>214</b>, the power circuit <b>158</b> includes a slave IST module <b>216</b>, the spindle/VCM driver <b>162</b> includes a slave IST module <b>218</b> and the preamplifier <b>140</b> includes a slave IST module <b>220</b>. Skilled artisans will appreciate, however, that there can be more than one master IST module in the system and/or each component may include one or more master and/or slave IST modules as needed. In some configurations, an IST module can be operated by the processor <b>110</b> as master using software in a boot ROM. Such an arrangement allows improved flexibility over a pure hardware arrangement to enhance an algorithm in the boot ROM.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the HDD system <b>100</b> is shown configured to execute several integrated system tests. The HDD system <b>100</b> receives test configuration instructions through the interface <b>124</b>. The HDD system <b>100</b> also sends test results to the host <b>120</b> through the interface <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">An integrated memory module test verifies that the memory module <b>156</b> is functional. The test configuration instructions configure the slave IST module <b>214</b> to enable a pattern generator <b>224</b> and a pattern comparator <b>226</b>. The pattern generator <b>224</b> can be routed through a first-in first-out (FIFO) buffer <b>228</b> included in the slave IST module <b>214</b>. The pattern generator <b>224</b> provides a predetermined bit pattern. A buffer/direct memory access module (DMA) <b>230</b> receives the predetermined bit pattern and writes it to an SDRAM <b>222</b>. The buffer/DMA module <b>230</b> then reads data from the SDRAM <b>222</b> and provides the SDRAM data to the pattern comparator <b>226</b>. The pattern comparator <b>226</b> compares the SDRAM data to the predetermined bit pattern originally provided by the pattern generator <b>224</b>. The slave IST module <b>214</b> concludes that the memory module <b>156</b> is fully functional when the SDRAM data and the predetermined bit patterns are identical.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">An interface/SDRAM test verifies that the interfaces <b>118</b> and <b>124</b> are able to communicate with the memory module <b>156</b>.

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a solder joint testing module <b>250</b> is shown. The solder joint testing module tests the integrity of a solder joint <b>252</b> between an integrated circuit <b>254</b> and an associated PCB trace <b>256</b>. Each of the IST module can include one or more solder joint testing modules <b>250</b>. The test instructions can then individually configure each IST modules to test selected solder joints associated with a particular IST module and its solder joint testing modules <b>250</b>. Each solder joint testing module <b>250</b> includes a pulse generator <b>258</b>, a receiver <b>260</b>, and a comparator <b>262</b>.
