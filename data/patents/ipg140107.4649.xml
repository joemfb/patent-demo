<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An x-ray analysis system with an x-ray source for producing an x-ray excitation beam directed toward an x-ray analysis focal area; and a sample chamber for presenting a fluid sample to the x-ray analysis focal area. The x-ray excitation beam is generated by an x-ray engine and passes through an x-ray transparent barrier on a wall of the chamber, to define an analysis focal area within space defined by the chamber. The fluid sample is presented as a stream supported in the space and streaming through the focal area, using a support structure to guide the sample stream. The chamber's barrier is therefore separated from both the focal area and the sample, resulting in lower corruption of the barrier.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/302,784, filed Feb. 9, 2010, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates in general to apparatus and methods used for x-ray analysis of sample streams. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a sample handling apparatus for presenting a supported sample stream to an x-ray analysis focal area.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">X-ray analysis of samples is a growing area of interest across many industries such as medical, pharmaceutical, and petroleum. The use of x-ray fluorescence, x-ray diffraction, x-ray spectroscopy, x-ray imaging, and other x-ray analysis techniques has led to a profound increase in knowledge in virtually all scientific fields.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,934,359 and 7,072,439, incorporated by reference herein in their entirety and assigned to X-Ray Optical Systems, Inc., the assignee of the present invention, disclose monochromatic wavelength dispersive x-ray fluorescence (MWD XRF) techniques and systems for the analysis of liquid samples. Moreover, commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 7,277,527 (also included by reference in its entirety), entitled &#x201c;Movable Transparent Barrier for X-Ray Analysis of a Pressurized Sample&#x201d; addresses a particular problem inherent in moving sample streams as discussed further below.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is an analytical technique by which a substance is exposed to a beam of x-rays to determine, for example, the presence of certain components. In XRF, at least some of the chemical constituents of the substance exposed to x-rays can absorb x-ray photons and produce characteristic secondary fluorescence. These secondary x-rays are characteristic of the chemical constituents in the substance. Upon appropriate detection and analysis these secondary x-rays can be used to characterize one or more of the chemical constituents. XRF techniques have broad applications in many chemical and material science fields, including industrial, medical, semiconductor chip evaluation, petroleum, and forensics, among others.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As one particular example, these patents disclose techniques for the determination of the level of sulfur in petroleum fuels, and a commercialized analyzer (SINDIE) is now in widespread use for this measurement at petroleum refining, pipeline, and terminal facilities.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">XRF techniques can be used for this application (as discussed above and throughout the above-incorporated patents). The basic technique involves exciting a fuel sample with x-rays and examining the fluorescence emitted. Each element emits a unique spectral signature. A detector then measures the wavelengths of the emitted x-rays, and software can reduce this measured spectrum to a weighted composition of the sulfur in the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">XRF fluid testing can take place off-line, i.e., using a bench-top, laboratory-type instrument to analyze a sample. The material is removed from its source (e.g., for fuel, from a refinery or transportation pipeline) and then simply deposited in a sample chamber; or into a windowed sample cell which is then deposited into a chamber. Off-line, bench-top instruments need not meet any unusual operational/pressure/environmental/size/weight/space/safety constraints, but merely need to provide the requisite measurement precision for a manually-placed sample. Moreover, off-line instruments can be easily maintained between measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In contrast to off-line analysis, on-line analysis provides &#x201c;real-time&#x201d; monitoring of sample composition at various points in the manufacturing process. For example, all fuel products are subject to sulfur level compliance&#x2014;requiring some variant of on-line monitoring during fuel refining and transportation in pipelines. On-line analysis of fuels in a refinery and in pipelines, however, requires consideration of numerous operational issues not generally present in an off-line, laboratory setting. A fully automated fuel sample handling system is required&#x2014;with little or no manual intervention or maintenance. Also, since fluids are usually under pressure in pipelines, any sample handling system must account for pressure differentials. This is especially important since certain portions of XRF x-ray &#x201c;engines&#x201d; (discussed further below) operate in a vacuum. Also, the instrument's electronics require packaging in an explosion-proof housing&#x2014;separate from the sample handling system.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this application, therefore, one of the most critical components is the sample barrier(s) which allow photons of x-rays to excite sulfur atoms in the fluid, and photons emitted from the atoms to be counted at the engine's detector, while at the same time maintaining the vacuum in the x-ray engine and the pressure of the fluid. X-ray stimulation creates sulfur (or other hard element) ionization and adsorption at this interface over time and on certain types of barrier materials&#x2014;leading to undesired sulfur residue and degradation of the barrier's x-ray transparency. More generally, many XRF applications require a barrier to protect the engine from any number of adverse interface effects from the sample material and/or the measurement environment.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The barrier system of above-incorporated U.S. Pat. No. 7,277,527, offered a very important and successful solution to these problems in the form of a moveable barrier advanced at programmable intervals to clean portions of a window roll. This technique, though successful and very functional in the field, has certain drawbacks, including the need to advance rolled, barrier material periodically using a mechanical system of rolls, motors, and controls. This barrier movement technique requires pressure adjustment, and moving parts to effect barrier movement. This barrier movement system itself requires periodic maintenance (and extra costs) to provide its function and also presents a potential failure mode in the system because of its complexity.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">What is required, therefore, is a lower cost and lower maintenance barrier technique and apparatus for an on-line x-ray analysis system, which protects the x-ray engine from adverse sample and environmental effects, while maintaining the integrity transparency of the interface to the sample for accurate measurements without excessive moving parts.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Disclosed herein is a technique for handling a sample as it is analyzed in an x-ray analysis system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a functional block diagram of a typical x-ray system <b>10</b> used for exposing a sample to x-ray radiation to produce fluorescent radiation which can then be detected and analyzed to determine a characteristic of the sample. The system typically includes an x-ray source <b>12</b>, a first x-ray focusing device <b>14</b>, a sample chamber <b>16</b>, a second x-ray focusing device <b>18</b>, and an x-ray detector <b>20</b>. The x-ray source <b>12</b>, for example, an x-ray tube, produces a beam of x-rays <b>22</b>. Though x-rays are used throughout the specification, the invention extends to neutron, particle-beam or gamma ray radiation. Beam <b>22</b> may diffracted or focused by means of one or more x-ray focusing optics <b>14</b> as discussed further below.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The sample under test in sample chamber <b>16</b> may be any desired substance for which a characteristic measurement is desired. If the sample is static (in, for example, an off-line system), the sample is typically located on a relatively flat surface, for example, an x-ray reflective flat surface or an optically-reflective surface. The sample, if a solid, liquid, or gas, may also be contained in a closed container or chamber, for example, a sealed container, having an x-ray transparent aperture through which x-ray beam can pass. The present invention is directed to, in general, low or high viscosity samples in streamable form (e.g., particulate, powders, liquid, gas, or a liquid-based material (e.g. slurry with particulate matter)) required to be moved through a chamber, and which exerts some other potentially disruptive forces or effects within the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">When irradiated by beam <b>24</b>, at least one of the constituents of sample in chamber <b>16</b> is excited in such a fashion that the constituent fluoresces, that is, produces a secondary source of x-rays <b>26</b> due to excitation by x-rays <b>24</b>. Again, since x-ray beam <b>26</b> is typically a diverging beam of x-rays, beam <b>26</b> is focused by means of the second x-ray focusing device <b>18</b>, for example, a device similar to device <b>14</b>, to produce a focused beam of x-rays <b>28</b> directed toward x-ray detector <b>20</b>. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that this and other aspects of the present invention, though described with respect to x-ray fluorescence applications, may also be utilized in x-ray diffraction, particle-beam, neutron or gamma ray applications.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">X-ray detector <b>20</b> may be a proportional counter-type or a semiconductor type x-ray detector (e.g., silicon drift detector), or any other suitable type of x-ray fluorescence detector known to one skilled in the art. Typically, x-ray detector <b>20</b> produces an electrical signal <b>30</b> containing at least some characteristic of the detected x-rays which is forwarded to an analyzer <b>32</b> for analysis, printout, or other display.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an x-ray fluorescence assembly <b>110</b> according to the above-incorporated U.S. Pat. No. 7,072,439, entitled &#x201c;X-Ray Tube and Method and Apparatus for Analyzing Fluid Streams Using X-Rays.&#x201d; This is an example of a sulfur in fuels analysis system, and also employing the principles of monochromatic X-Ray excitation and collection as set forth in the above-incorporated U.S. Pat. No. 6,934,359, entitled &#x201c;Wavelength Dispersive XRF System Using Focusing Optic for Excitation and a Focusing Monochromator for Collection.&#x201d; X-ray fluorescence assembly <b>110</b> (shown with its housing removed) comprises an x-ray source assembly <b>112</b>, a sample chamber assembly <b>116</b> and an x-ray detector assembly <b>120</b>. A curved crystal, monochromating and focusing optic <b>114</b> is shown in the excitation path, along with another curved crystal focusing optic <b>118</b> in the detection path. X-ray source assembly <b>112</b> produces an x-ray beam <b>122</b> which is focused by x-ray focusing optic <b>114</b> to produce a focused beam <b>124</b> on a sample under test in chamber assembly <b>116</b>. The x-ray fluorescence created by the x-ray irradiation of the sample in sample excitation chamber assembly <b>116</b> generates x-ray fluorescent beam <b>126</b>. Beam <b>126</b> is focused by x-ray focusing device <b>118</b> to provide a focused x-ray beam <b>128</b> which is directed to x-ray detector assembly <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In prior art methods of XRF detection, the sample excitation path and detection path are maintained in an inert gas atmosphere, for example, in a helium atmosphere. However, the unavailability of inert gases, especially in remote locations, makes the implementation of these prior art processes inconvenient. In contrast, here the sample excitation path and the detection path may be maintained under vacuum and no inert gas is necessary. For example, the radiation paths of system <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be held under vacuum, for example, at least about 15 torr. The vacuum can be provided by a venturi pump having no moving parts. However, if desired and available, an inert gas such as nitrogen or helium can be introduced and maintained in a housing, for example, under pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The use of a vacuum enclosing the x-ray engine (e.g., source, excitation path, collection path, and detector) leads to certain problems at the sample interface&#x2014;at the respective focal spots of beams <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the engine's interface to the sample chamber <b>116</b> is not directly shown, but may consist of a beryllium or kapton window barrier&#x2014;which is strong and has the requisite x-ray transparency. But, additional levels of transparency are required when the sample chamber and its operational environment present certain operational difficulties as discussed above, especially in on-line systems.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In accordance with the present invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts in schematic view an exemplary MWD XRF x-ray analysis engine <b>200</b> in combination with a sample chamber <b>260</b>. As discussed above, the x-ray analysis engine may involve a focal area (created by excitation and/or detection optics) requiring alignment with the sample in the sample cell. Engine <b>200</b> includes, in one embodiment, an x-ray source <b>210</b> and detector <b>250</b>. X-ray optics <b>220</b> and/or <b>240</b> can be placed in the excitation and/or detection paths of the engine. These optics require a high degree of alignment with the sample focal area to function at the requisite limits of detection discussed above. Such optics include, for example, curved crystal monochromating optics such as those disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,285,506; 6,317,483; and 7,035,374; and/or multilayer optics; and/or polycapillary optics such as those disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,192,869; 5,175,755; 5,497,008; 5,745,547; 5,570,408; and 5,604,353. Optic/source combinations such as those disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,110,506; 7,209,545; and 7,257,193 are also useable. Each of the above-noted patents is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Exemplary curved monochromating optics in the excitation and detection paths are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which is the engine configuration of the SINDIE sulfur analyzer discussed above. However, an optic may only be present in one of these paths, which still requires precise alignment. In one example, an optic of any of the above-described types may only be present in the excitation path, and the detection path would include an energy dispersive detector. This is the common configuration of an energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) system.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Optic <b>220</b> focuses and monochromates the excitation x-rays <b>222</b> from the source <b>210</b> to a focal area <b>280</b> within the sample chamber <b>260</b>. Optic <b>240</b> may also be used to focus the secondary fluorescence x-rays <b>242</b> from the focal area <b>280</b> to the detector <b>250</b>. The excitation x-rays <b>222</b> and fluorescence x-rays <b>242</b> pass through an engine window barrier <b>290</b> (e.g., beryllium) and chamber barrier <b>262</b> to the focal area <b>280</b> within the chamber <b>260</b> and through which a sample flows. &#x201c;Focal area&#x201d; is used broadly herein to connote a sample analysis area to/from which x-rays are directed. In one embodiment, the focal area could be a small focal point with a diameter between 1-2 mm (or smaller) formed by converging excitation and/or fluorescence x-rays.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In accordance with the present invention, the sample is presented into the sample chamber as a sample stream <b>270</b>. The sample stream is supported within the sample chamber and is spaced apart from the chamber's barrier <b>262</b>. The sample chamber could part of a larger flow pipe system, a section of which is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, or could be a relatively confined space as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> below with a sample inlet and outlet. Therefore, the term &#x201c;sample chamber&#x201d; is used broadly herein to connote any type of apparatus within which a sample stream can be defined, near the x-ray engine. The word &#x201c;through&#x201d; is broadly used herein to connote the stream passing directly through the focal area, or proximate thereto, with proximity being adequate enough to create the stimulation and/or fluorescent x-rays as required in a workable x-ray system.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The exemplary embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<i>g </i>can each have the following features, in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention:</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">(1) they each may be implemented inside of an otherwise sealed sample chamber (e.g., chamber <b>260</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and operate to support the sample stream inside chamber, but spaced from the x-ray penetrable barrier <b>262</b> of chamber <b>260</b>;</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">(2) the sample stream <b>270</b> can be supplied to these structures by any one of a number of means, including nozzles, capillary flow, surface tension effects, etc.&#x2014;in one embodiment, a reservoir holding the sample can dispense the sample over the support structure and can be separately replenished with a source of sample therefore de-coupling the sample source from the shape of the support structure;</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">(3) surface tension, including capillary action, of the stream along the surfaces of these support structures can be used to further define and/or maintain the desired form of flow;</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">(4) forces of gravity can be used to further define and/or maintain the desired form of flow;</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">(5) additional stimuli, such as vibrations (inducing additional types of surface tension) and/or heat (for maintaining a consistent viscosity), can be supplied to these structures, to define and/or maintain the desired form of flow;</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">(6) the support structures can be oriented in any direction (e.g., horizontal, vertical, etc.) consistent with the desired form of flow;</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">(7) the chosen position of the support structures should be arranged to allow unimpeded access to the sample stream by the excitation x-rays <b>222</b>, however, in one improved embodiment, the structures themselves could be formed from an x-ray penetrable material, allowing more flexibility in positioning the structures relative to the excitation x-rays <b>222</b>;</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">(8) the structures can be rigid, or can be flexibly mounted to define and/or maintain the desired flow;</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">(9) structural combinations of any of the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<i>g </i>can be used to define and/or maintain the desired flow; and</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">(10) any one (or a combination) of the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<i>g </i>can be used in combination with the techniques of the commonly assigned, co-pending U.S. patent application entitled &#x201c;Sample Module with Sample Stream Spaced from Window, for X-Ray Analysis System&#x201d;, filed Feb. 24, 2009, Ser. No. 12/391,677, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein. In that application a sample stream is suspended using, e.g., pressurized nozzles and/or guiding laminar air flows. Such pressure and/or flows can be used to further define and/or maintain the desired flow, for example, be used before, between, or after, the support structures described herein within the chamber. (In that co-pending application, a flow interface surface allows the sample stream to maintain suspension within chamber using continuous &#x201c;laminar&#x201d; air flow through conduits. The continuous air flow keeps the flow of the sample stream spaced apart from the chamber barrier, and can also be used to purge unwanted fumes or other residue created by the sample (either simultaneous with a streaming sample or off-line). In addition, as a simultaneous or separate technique, the sample stream may also be suspended within the sample chamber by applying pressure to the fluid sample as it enters the chamber. A pressurized sample stream can be used in combination with the air flow from the interface or by itself to achieve its suspended nature while in the sample chamber. This interface surface also allows the sample module to be operated horizontally without compromising the suspended sample stream, i.e., there are no particular orientation requirements of the chamber&#x2014;if the streaming technique is designed correctly.)</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one example of stream embodiments, the stream may be of a diameter of 1-2 mm, which corresponds to the size of the focal point (therefore minimizing the amount of sample in the chamber); and is spaced from the chamber barrier <b>262</b> by about 2-6 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The sample is broadly defined herein as any type of streamable material including particulate, liquid, gas, or a liquid-based material (e.g. slurry with particulate matter). This includes any petroleum-based products. This invention is particularly useful for analytes like sulfur and chlorine that are present in petroleum fuels, including distillates (gasoline or diesel) or low, medium, or high viscosity fuels (at ambient temperature, or heated to control their viscosity). The inventors recognized that window degradation is a particularly serious problem to address for these analytes.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one improved embodiment, applicable to any of the examples discussed above, a separate stream of water, air, or mixture thereof can be used to clean the inside of barrier <b>262</b> from any inadvertent contamination (with or without its own guiding structures, curtains, etc) to prevent interference with the sample which is spaced from the barrier. This is enabled by the spacing between the sample stream and the inside of this barrier. In another improved embodiment, a second, x-ray penetrable barrier can be placed as a protective layer in the chamber near barrier <b>262</b>, enabled by the spacing between the sample stream and the inside of this barrier. This new barrier could be removable, for occasional cleaning of any inadvertent contamination.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The present invention provides more accurate analysis results, as follows: (1) Since the barrier remains clean by use of a supported sample stream, rather than a system involving direct sample/barrier contact, and/or any type of active barrier cleaning/replacement system, there are fewer moving parts which reduces maintenance and cost requirements for the system as well as eliminating a potential cause for system failure. (2) Moreover, having a focal area spaced away from the barrier also reduces the chance for residue build-up as follows: The problems discussed above regarding barrier residue are caused in large part to the x-ray focal area being directly on or near the chamber barrier. This increases the x-ray flux per unit area on the barrier (because of the focusing optics). This increased flux contributed to the rate of residue build-up on the sample barrier. In the present invention (as evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), the chamber barrier <b>262</b> is located in a portion of the x-ray beam <b>222</b>/<b>242</b> which has a lower flux-per-area, and is therefore not as highly stimulated by the x-rays, on a per-unit-area basis. And, if any residue does reside on the barrier, it does not have the same interference effect it would have, if the focal point is on the barrier as in the past. The spaced barrier, even if corrupted, therefore does not interfere with the analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Therefore, the present invention provides at least two simultaneous and important features&#x2014;it provides a sample spaced from the barrier, along with a focal area spaced from the barrier. Together, these effects reduce the level of residue and also the need for barrier cleaning</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Although preferred embodiments have been depicted and described in detail herein, it will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant art that various modifications, additions, substitutions and the like can be made without departing from the spirit of the invention and these are therefore considered to be within the scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.</p>
