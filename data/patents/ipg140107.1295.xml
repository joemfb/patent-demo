<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Several views of a child vehicle seat <b>1</b> in accordance with the present disclosure are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. The child vehicle seat <b>1</b> comprises a seat portion <b>2</b>, a backrest <b>3</b>, a headrest <b>4</b> which is movable with respect to the seat portion <b>2</b> and the backrest <b>3</b>, and a headrest-height controller <b>20</b>. The part of the headrest <b>4</b> the child is resting against is located on a front side of the backrest <b>3</b>. The backrest <b>3</b> is provided with two elongated belt-receiving openings <b>5</b> which are bounded by flanges <b>6</b>. Two vertically extending tracks <b>7</b> are located at each side of each belt-receiving opening <b>5</b>. Each track <b>7</b> is provided with seven recesses <b>8</b>, whereby recesses <b>8</b> of the four tracks <b>7</b> are aligned with each other in horizontal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The headrest-height controller <b>20</b> is provided with two guide elements <b>9</b> being swivelable about a swivel axis <b>10</b> with respect to the headrest <b>4</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Above the guide elements <b>9</b>, as suggested in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</figref>, the headrest-height controller <b>20</b> is provided with first and second slidable blocks <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> and each of the slidable blocks <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> includes flanges <b>11</b> which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</figref> and are slidable along the flanges <b>6</b> at a rear side of the backrest <b>3</b> as suggested in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b>. Each of the slidable blocks <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> is coupled to a companion guide element <b>9</b> for swivelable movement about a common swivel axis <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The headrest-height controller <b>20</b> is also provided with an operating member <b>12</b> that is pivotable about a pivot axis <b>13</b> with respect to the headrest <b>4</b> as suggested in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b>. At a side near the top of the headrest <b>4</b>, the operating member <b>12</b> is provided with a handle <b>14</b>. At a side remote from the handle <b>14</b> and on the other side of the pivot axis <b>13</b>, the operating member <b>12</b> comprises a support <b>15</b> supporting an elongated rod <b>16</b>. The rod <b>16</b> extends through the guide members <b>9</b>, thereby supporting the guide members <b>9</b>. The operating member <b>12</b> is relatively simple so that it is easy to manufacture, to mount, and to operate.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the position of the headrest <b>4</b> and the operating member <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the rod <b>16</b> is located in four aligned recesses <b>8</b> of the four tracks <b>7</b>. The rod <b>16</b> forms a locking member for the headrest <b>4</b>. A spring <b>17</b> is located between the operating member <b>12</b> and the headrest <b>4</b> at a location between the rod <b>16</b> and the pivot axis <b>13</b> as suggested in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b>. By means of the spring <b>17</b>, the rod <b>16</b> is urged by the operating member <b>12</b> towards the recesses <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The child seat <b>1</b> is provided with a five-point safety belt system. Since such a five-point safety belt system is well known by child vehicle seats, only a portion of the shoulder belts <b>18</b> is shown in the figures. The shoulder belts <b>18</b> are being guided by the guide elements <b>9</b> from the rear side of the backrest <b>3</b> through the belt-receiving openings <b>5</b> to the front side of the backrest <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the position of the headrest <b>4</b> and the operating member <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the headrest <b>4</b> is in its highest position whereby the rod <b>16</b> is located in the highest recesses <b>8</b> of the four tracks <b>7</b>. Due to the use of four tracks <b>7</b> and one single rod <b>16</b> which supports the guide elements <b>9</b>, a reliable and good fixation of the guide elements <b>9</b> to the backrest <b>3</b> is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">If a user wants to lower the headrest <b>4</b>, he places his hand on the handle <b>14</b> and pulls the handle <b>14</b> towards the headrest <b>4</b> against the force of the spring <b>17</b>. Due to said movement, the operating member <b>12</b> is being pivoted about the pivot axis <b>13</b> in the direction as indicated by arrow P<b>1</b>, whereby the rod <b>16</b> will be moved out of engagement with the recesses <b>8</b> and the guide elements <b>9</b> will be swiveled in the direction as indicated by arrow P<b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">This position of the headrest <b>4</b> and the operating member <b>12</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>. As is clearly visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the spring <b>17</b> is being compressed.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">While maintaining the operating member <b>12</b> in the position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>, the user can now move the headrest <b>4</b> downwardly in the direction as indicated by arrow P<b>3</b> to adjust the headrest <b>4</b> for a smaller child. Simultaneously with the headrest <b>4</b>, the guide members <b>9</b> and the shoulder belts <b>18</b> will be moved downwardly so that also the shoulder belts <b>18</b> are adjusted to the size of the child.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a position of the headrest <b>4</b> and the operating member <b>12</b> is shown, whereby the rod <b>16</b> is located near the lowest recesses <b>8</b> but out of engagement therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As soon as the headrest <b>4</b> is located at the desired height with respect to the seat part <b>2</b>, the user removes his hand from the handle <b>14</b>. Under influence of the spring force of spring <b>17</b>, the operating member <b>12</b> will be pivoted in a direction indicated by arrow P<b>4</b> being opposite to the direction as indicated by arrow P<b>1</b> and the rod <b>16</b> will be brought into engagement with four aligned recesses <b>8</b> of the four tracks <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a position of the headrest <b>4</b> and the operating member <b>12</b> is shown, whereby the rod <b>16</b> is in engagement with the lowest recesses <b>8</b>. It is also possible to use less or more tracks <b>7</b> or to provide the tracks <b>7</b> with more or less recesses <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In illustrative embodiments, each of first and second shoulder belts <b>18</b>, <b>18</b> is guided by means of a guide element <b>9</b> that is supported for up-and-down movement relative to backrest <b>3</b> by rod <b>16</b> as rod <b>16</b> is moved relative to backrest <b>3</b> by operating member <b>12</b>. By moving rod <b>16</b> from one recess <b>8</b> to another recess <b>8</b>, headrest <b>4</b> will be moved to another vertical position. Since guide elements <b>9</b> are being supported by rod <b>16</b>, guide elements <b>9</b> and therefore both shoulder belts <b>18</b>, <b>18</b> will be adjusted simultaneously with headrest <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In illustrative embodiments, each guide element <b>9</b> is swivelable about a swivel axis <b>10</b> relative to headrest <b>4</b>. Since each guide element <b>9</b> is swivelable with respect to headrest <b>4</b>, each guide element <b>9</b> can be moved with respect to headrest <b>4</b> if rod <b>16</b> is pivoted about pivot axis <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In illustrative embodiments, backrest <b>3</b> is formed to include openings <b>5</b> and each guide element <b>9</b> is aligned with one of openings <b>5</b>. In such a manner, shoulder belts <b>18</b>, <b>18</b> can be guided easily through openings <b>5</b>, <b>5</b> from the back side of backrest <b>3</b> to the front side of backrest <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In illustrative embodiments, along both sides of opening <b>5</b>, a track <b>7</b> formed to include at least two recesses <b>8</b> is provided. By having more than one track <b>7</b> on backrest <b>3</b>, rod <b>16</b> can be engaged in several recesses <b>8</b> at the same time to provide a reliable connection between rod <b>16</b> and backrest <b>3</b>. Illustratively, tracks <b>7</b> extend parallel to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In illustrative embodiments, at least one spring <b>17</b> is arranged to extend between headrest <b>4</b> and operating member <b>12</b> to urge rod <b>16</b> into engagement with one of the recesses <b>8</b>. Due to spring <b>17</b>, rod <b>16</b> will be kept in a recess <b>8</b> and only when a force is applied on rod <b>16</b> which will overcome spring <b>17</b> will rod <b>16</b> be moved out of recess <b>8</b>.</p>
