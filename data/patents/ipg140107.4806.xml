<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) to two Korean Patent Applications entitled &#x201c;Method for Recognizing and Translating Characters in Camera-Based Image&#x201d; filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Jul. 10, 2008 and Jun. 25, 2009 and assigned Ser. Nos. 10-2008-0067098 and 10-2009-0057266, respectively, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to character recognition, and more particularly to a method for recognizing characters included in an image photographed by a camera and translating the recognized characters in connection with a dictionary.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional character recognition usually involves a method in which the contents of a paper document are scanned by a scanner and the form of the scanned contents is then changed to that of a text file or an electronic document. However, a method has recently been proposed for recognizing characters in an image photographed by a portable digital device that includes a small digital camera mounted thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventional scanners are limited to recognizing characters written on paper. On the other hand, a portable digital device, on which a digital camera is mounted, is capable of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using the camera. Namely, a character recognition method using a camera mounted on a portable digital device can recognize characters represented on each of various mediums (e.g., a monument, a road guide signboard, a menu board, and various explanatory notes).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, in using the camera for character recognition, as described above, there is no limitation on characters to be recognized. Accordingly, there may occur a case where it is impossible to recognize characters due to not only the diversity of the characters to be recognized but also external factors (e.g., lighting around the characters to be recognized).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flowchart showing a character recognition method for recognizing characters in a photographed image according to the prior art. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the conventional character recognition method <b>100</b> includes photographing an image including characters by a camera in step S<b>1</b>, processing data of the photographed image in step S<b>2</b>, an interface step S<b>3</b>, normalizing each of the characters in step S<b>4</b>, extracting a feature of each normalized character in step S<b>5</b>, recognizing a character and a word based on the extracted feature of each character in step S<b>6</b>, and providing a translation result in step S<b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">More specifically, step S<b>1</b> includes the characters to be recognized, and obtaining an image representing the subject. Step S<b>2</b> corresponds to converting the photographed image to a gray scale image. The photographed image may be a color image including various colors. However, for character recognition, it is necessary to remove unnecessary colors from the photographed image and convert the photographed image to a gray scale image.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Step S<b>3</b> corresponds to compensating for the photographed image in order to have a form suitable for the character recognition according to both the characteristics of the camera used for photographing the image and an environment where the image has been photographed.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Also, step S<b>4</b> corresponds to converting each character (e.g. a consonant and vowel in Hangeul and each letter in the English alphabet, on a minimum basis) to be recognized, which is included in the photographed image, to a character having the form of a predetermined standard. Step S<b>5</b> corresponds to extracting a feature of each character to be recognized.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Step S<b>6</b> corresponds to recognizing an objective character (i.e., defining a photographed character) based on the feature of each extracted character. Step S<b>7</b> corresponds to combining the recognized characters into words and providing the combination result to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The conventional method further includes a user interface step, in which stored result data of recognized characters from step S<b>6</b> is stored inside of the device, the recognized characters or words are output on a screen device, and then the words selected by a user's selecting means are searched in connection with an electronic DataBase (DB) and are output again on the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the conventional character recognition method described above, particularly, with respect to recognition and dictionary translation of a character image, a user interface capable of recognizing both characters included in a character image and actually recognized characters is cumbersome. During recognition on the entire character image, the recognition ratio is typically low due to restrictive hardware performance and inclusion of various noises, and herein, a user interface also may be cumbersome.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, the present invention has been made to solve the above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior art, and the present invention provides a method for recognizing characters, which improves the accuracy of character recognition, and can recognize various characters and simultaneously, improves the convenience of a user interface, in an apparatus capable of recognizing characters in an image photographed by a camera.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a method for recognizing and translating characters in an image photographed by a camera is provided. The method includes recognizing characters and words included in the photographed image, and translating a word or characters selected by a user based on data in a dictionary, which is associated with the selected word; and providing the recognized characters and words to the user and directing translation of the selected characters or word, which corresponds to a user interface process, wherein recognizing the characters and words includes translating the characters or word selected in the user interface process, and provides the translated characters or word to the user through the user interface process.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, a detailed description of functions known to the public, which is related to the present invention, or a configuration according to the present invention will be omitted to avoid making the subject matter of the present invention unclear.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The present invention provides a method for recognizing characters included in a photographed image. The method for recognizing characters included in the image photographed by a camera according to the present invention includes a character and word recognition and translation step and a user interface step. Herein, the character and word recognition and translation step includes recognizing characters and words included in the photographed image, and translating a word selected by a user based on data in a dictionary, which is connected with the selected word. The user interface step provides, to the user, the characters and words that have been recognized in the character and word recognition and translation step and directs the translation of characters or the word selected by the user. The character and word recognition and translation step includes translating the characters or word selected in the user interface step and providing the translated characters or word to the user through the user interface step.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In describing the method for recognizing characters according to the present invention, the method may be classified into a method in which the entire photographed image is designated as an object of character recognition, and a method in which only a partial range of the photographed image is designated as an object of character recognition. The user interface step as described above includes multiple steps, which are required for provision to the user or the user's selections during the character and word recognition and translation step.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method for recognizing characters according to a first embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> further illustrates an embodiment of the present invention in which an entire photographed image is designated as the object of the character recognition. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the method for recognizing characters in the image photographed by the camera according to the present invention includes the character and word recognition step and the user interface step. Herein, the character and word recognition step includes recognizing characters and words included in the photographed image and comparing each of the recognized words with data in a dictionary, which is connected with each of the recognized words. The user interface step includes providing the characters and words, which have been recognized in the character and word recognition step, to the user, and directing the character and word recognition step according to the user's selection.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The user interface steps include photographing an image in step S<b>201</b>, selecting a recognition range of the photographed image for recognizing characters included in the photographed image in step S<b>202</b>, providing a result of the recognition or translation to the user in steps S<b>203</b> through S<b>205</b>, checking with the user if the user selects characters or a word other than the characters or word that the user have/has selected in step S<b>6</b> and returning to steps S<b>203</b> to S<b>205</b> when the user selects characters or a word, and determining the user desires returning to step S<b>201</b> when the user does not select characters or a word in step S<b>207</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When the user selects the entire photographed image as the object of the character recognition in step S<b>202</b>, the character and word recognition step S<b>209</b> is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The character and word recognition steps include recognizing each of the characters included in the photographed image in step S<b>209</b>, constructing a word from each recognized character, and searching a dictionary for data connected with the constructed word and checking the meaning of the constructed word in the dictionary in step S<b>210</b>, and in step S<b>211</b>, providing the checked word or recognized characters (i.e., a result of completing the recognition or translation) to the user through step S<b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart further illustrating step S<b>209</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the character recognition step S<b>209</b> includes pre-processing for removing the noise of the corresponding character image and binarizing the image in step S<b>410</b>, separating and normalizing individual words in step S<b>420</b>, extracting a feature of each character in step S<b>430</b>; a feature-based character recognizing step S<b>440</b>, in which the extracted feature of each character is compared with data on the previously stored features of characters, and the highest priority information (the most matching result obtained through the comparison with the previously stored data on features of the respective characters) is output, and a post-processing step S<b>450</b> for separating and storing the recognized character recognition results.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart further illustrating step S<b>410</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the pre-processing step S<b>410</b> includes analyzing an input image in step S<b>411</b>, selecting a character region in an image to be analyzed in step S<b>412</b>, determining whether the brightness of each of the character region and a background region included in the image is inverted in step S<b>413</b>, inverting the brightness of each of the character region and the background region, converting data of the character region of the image, which has gone through step <b>413</b> or <b>414</b>, to binary data in step S<b>415</b>, and separating the character region, the data of which has been converted to the binary data, from the image in step S<b>416</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the pre-processing step S<b>410</b>, the image is analyzed by using a histogram, etc., of the image photographed in the user interface step, and distinguishes between the character region and background region. Then, in the pre-processing step S<b>410</b> multiple steps are performed to determine whether each of the character region and background region is inverted based on hue values (e.g., brightness values).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart illustrating the post-processing step S<b>450</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the post-processing step S<b>450</b> includes analyzing the recognition result of a character or a word based on the extracted feature of each character in step S<b>451</b>, distinguishing between a character region and a background region in the photographed image in step S<b>452</b>, removing the background region other than the character region in step S<b>453</b>, and generating, in step S<b>454</b>, information for reporting the completion of step S<b>450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The post-processing step S<b>450</b> is performed in order to correct an error due to incorrect character recognition or noise interference. Accordingly, the post-processing step S<b>450</b> includes determining whether the recognized characters include a non-character, which has been incorrectly recognized as a character, and then corrects the error.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> are illustrative views illustrating implementation examples of the method for recognizing characters according to the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> illustrates an example for implementing the character recognition method in an apparatus including a touch-screen <b>510</b>. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> illustrates an example of the character recognition method according to the present invention, in which the entire photographed image is designated as an object of character recognition. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, both a non-selected character <b>501</b> and a selected character <b>502</b> have already been processed as the object of character recognition. A result of recognizing and translating the selected character <b>502</b> is provided to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Although the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is implemented by using the touch-screen <b>510</b>, a user may alternatively select a particular character or word by using a navigation key <b>520</b>, etc. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> illustrates another example of selecting a partial range <b>601</b> of a photographed image <b>610</b> as an object of the character recognition. A recognition result of a character or word that the user has selected in the selected range <b>601</b> is provided to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7D</figref> are illustrative views showing implementation examples of the method for recognizing characters according to the present invention. The implementation examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7D</figref> are for implementing a range for designating an object of the character recognition or a method for selecting recognized characters and word. Each of the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7D</figref> is implemented by using a touch-screen, and can thus be implemented by using a separate touch pen or a part of the user's body. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows an embodiment in the form of drawing an oblique line <b>701</b> on a word to be selected. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> a user may draw a line <b>702</b> having no predetermined shape around a word to be selected. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, a user may draw a box-shaped line <b>703</b> around a word to be selected. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>, a user may draw an underline <b>704</b> underneath a word to be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A to 9C</figref> are illustrative views of still another example of the method for recognizing characters in a photographed image according to the present invention. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A to 9C</figref>, only a partial range of the photographed image is designated as an object of the character recognition. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref> is still another example of a screen, the entirety of which is used to create the translation result shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to the present invention, a user may selecting a partial range or the entire range of a photographed image. Further, an input means such as a touch-screen or a navigation key may be used in selecting recognized or translated characters and words.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The present invention provides a method of recognizing characters included in a photographed image, constructing a word from a recognized character string, and translating the words. Herein, the method of recognizing characters included in a character image photographed by a camera provides an interface, which is for recognizing/translating characters included in the photographed image and a word including a character string and providing the corresponding location information to a user via a screen, or it can be used for translating a word existing on a user's selected location on the screen in connection with a DB of an electronic dictionary and instinctively providing the result to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method for recognizing and translating characters, according to a second embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method for recognizing and translating characters, according to a third embodiment of the present invention. The second and third embodiments of the present invention are summed up into two characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">First, in a recognition step of a photographed character image, when a user directly selects an area to be character-recognized, the location area information of an individual character-recognized character or word is directly displayed on a screen providing the character image. Then, when the user finally selects a character string of a specific word, to be translated, the corresponding word is translated by using an electronic dictionary built in a portable terminal and the result is instinctively provided to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Second, in some languages having no spacing between words, such as Chinese or Japanese, unlike English, characters included in a photographed image are character-recognized, and are translated by using a DB of a built-in electronic dictionary. For a character string having no spacing between words, there are some techniques for spacing or separating words.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a method for recognizing and translating characters included in a photographed character image, according to a second embodiment of the present invention, is described as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In step S<b>801</b>, a camera character image is photographed and stored by a user. In step S<b>802</b> the user selects an area to be recognized in the photographed image. In step S<b>803</b>, character-recognizing and storing of the recognized characters included in the selected area is performed. In step S<b>804</b>, post-processing of recognized character strings and construction of an electronic dictionary database search candidate words is performed. In step S<b>805</b>, recognized characters and words are provided as selectable items to the user. In step S<b>806</b>, the user selects an object to be translated from among selectable characters or words provided from step S<b>805</b>. In step S<b>807</b>, a search for the selected characters or word is performed. In step S<b>808</b>, verification of the searched characters or word is performed. In step S<b>809</b>, the translation result of the characters or word verified in step S<b>808</b> is provided to the user. In step S<b>810</b>, selection of a connection function reliant to an operation of an electronic dictionary is performed. In step S<b>811</b>, it is determined whether to return to a screen providing the translation result. In step S<b>812</b>, if the method does not return to the screen providing a translation result, another word to be translated is selected. In step S<b>813</b>, another area to be recognized in the character image is selected, if another word to be translated is not selected in step S<b>812</b>; In step S<b>814</b>, it is determined whether to recognize another character image, if another unrecognized area in the character image is not selected in step S<b>813</b>, wherein in step S<b>810</b> for operating the electronic dictionary after step S<b>809</b>, a means with which a user can directly operate the electronic dictionary is provided to the user via the screen, and then when the operating means is selected, the operating state of the electronic dictionary is displayed on the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In step S<b>802</b>, a user directly selects an area to be recognized in a character image provided via a screen included in a portable terminal, or the like, and the location information of the selected area is displayed over the character image provided via the screen so that the user can easily recognize the information via the screen. In step S<b>802</b>, the user can select the area to be recognized by using the drag of a touch screen or a pointing device, such as a mouse.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In step S<b>803</b>, the characters included in the character image displayed on the screen are recognized and the result is stored, so as to store and output individual recognized characters as a type of digital character data. Herein, the characters included in the area in the character image, which is selected by the user, are recognized, thereby increasing the character recognition ratio and reducing the time necessary for recognition.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In step S<b>805</b>, location information of all words including the recognized characters is directly provided over the character image provided via the screen. Herein, the characters and words recognized in step S<b>803</b> are overlapped onto the image displayed on the screen while the screen provides the character image in the state before the recognition. A colorful square wrapping the characters and words recognized in step S<b>803</b> is provided so as to allow the user to select the recognized characters or words. Also, when the user selects a part of the entire character image, the location information on words or characters included in the area selected by the user is provided as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In step S<b>806</b>, the user selects an object to be translated from among selectable characters or words provided from step S<b>805</b>. Herein, from among the words showing their location information on the character image provided via the screen, the user highlights the location information of a word or a character string, located most closely to the location he wants to select, so as to separate the character from other unselected words or character strings. In other words, in step S<b>806</b>, a distance from the middle point between the start point and the end point of a word or a character string, to the location selected by the user is calculated, and thus the location of a word or a character string, located most closely to the location selected by the user, is determined. Also, the location information (the word or character string selected by the user, or a word or character string adjacent to the word or character string selected by the user) is set to have a different color or thickness from unselected words or characters, so that the location of the word or character string, determined to be selected by the user, can be more easily recognized by the user, compared to other neighboring words or character strings.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In step S<b>807</b>, the word or character string at the location selected by the user is set as a search word, and is searched in connection with the DB of the electronic dictionary, and then the result is verified. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method for post-processing a character string and constructing candidate words to be searched in connection with an electronic dictionary DB, according to a second embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, if an object to be applied to step S<b>807</b> is a language having no spaces between words such as Chinese or Japanese, step S<b>807</b> may include character-recognizing the character image and loading all stored data of character strings, filtering out numbers or special characters included in the loaded character strings, comparing the character strings, after the filtering process, with the electronic dictionary, and separating searched words, searching for some words from among the separated words, which are directly selected by the user via the screen, in connection with the electronic dictionary. Step S<b>807</b> includes searching for words including recognized characters, based on the electronic dictionary, and comparing entry words or keywords included in a list of the searched words, with each other, to verify translated contents.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A to 10B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A to 11B</figref> are for illustrating specific examples according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> illustrate an actual photographed and recognized character image, and location information of candidate search words of the electronic dictionary DB, which is overlapped on the character image and is wrapped by a square. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A to 11B</figref> are views for schematically illustrating the processes of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, in which the post-processing on initially recognized individual characters and character strings and the construction of the final candidate search words of the electronic dictionary are sequentially carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> shows the character image displayed on the screen, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> shows the location information of the words constructed through the post-processing of character recognition, which is displayed over the character image. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> shows data of individual characters obtained from character image recognition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> shows the state where the recognized characters are post-processed by using a word database, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> shows the state where the construction of words is completed after the removal of special characters and symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In step S<b>809</b>, for the electronic dictionary database search word at the location selected by the user, on the character image displayed on the screen, a dictionary entry word or a keyword searched from the electronic dictionary database, and corresponding meanings are directly provided to the user. Herein, the translation results are provided in a semi-transparent type allowing other image information to be shown to the user. Further, if the search result overlaps a previous search result, the search result is provided to the user via the screen in such a manner that it does not overlap the previous search result.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The method for recognizing and translating a character image, according to the present embodiment, is largely divided into constructing the display of the screen in such a manner that the user can selectively select an area to be recognized, displaying relative location information of the recognized corresponding character string or words the recognized character image displayed on the screen device, from among character-recognized result data information, in such a manner that the user can easily distinguish the information from the previous information, and selecting a word from among the distinguished words by the user, searching the electronic dictionary for the selected word, and instinctively providing the result of the translation to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A to 9C</figref> illustrate a configuration of entire recognition data stored after recognition of a character image. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A to 9C</figref> sequentially show, as a result of the character image recognition, individually recognized characters, individual words including the individual characters, the structure of individual character strings including the individual words, and a block including the character strings. In general, in a case of English character recognition, for a character string having spaces between individual words, the spaces between the words are also recognized, and thus in the output result, the user can directly recognize individual words. However, the character image recognition of some languages with a character string having no spaces between words, such as Chinese or Japanese, further requires a step of separating individual words (which will be further described later). In solving the above described problem, the following methods are used.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In a first method, individual characters of the character image are recognized, and then for a sentence of a character string written in the corresponding country's language, words of individual meaning components are separated (a morpheme analysis method).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In a second method, individual characters are recognized, and then for a sentence of the recognized character strings, individual words are separated by separately using a large-scale word list database of a corresponding language. However, the above described methods further require the use of large-scale information, a cellular phone memory and a Central Processing Unit (CPU), thereby severely restricting the application of the methods to current portable terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The pre-processing step S<b>410</b> in performing the character recognition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, includes processing the corresponding image in such a manner that even when the color of a character in a character image, to be recognized, is lighter than the background color of the character, the character can be recognized. In the above described step, although there may be differences between the kinds of character recognizers, a character recognizer may directly include the above described steps in its structure.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A to 12C</figref> are views illustrating an example of a character image processed according to a method of selecting an electronic dictionary data search word by the user, according to an embodiment of the present invention. When the user selects the location as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, from among candidate search words among showing their corresponding locations search on the screen, the corresponding candidate search word is selected as a search word while being provided to the user as result information from search translation in connection with the electronic dictionary database. Various techniques are used to easily distinguish the selected search words from other neighboring candidate search words. In such techniques, when the user does not directly select the location area of a corresponding word in selecting a search word from among candidate search words, the location (e.g., the square in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>) of a candidate search word most adjacent to the user's selected location area on the screen is automatically calculated as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>, and is selectably shown.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A to 13D</figref> are views illustrating a character image according to methods for providing location information of a selected word to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a verification method for determining whether a search word selected by the user matches the searched electronic dictionary keyword or entry word. The verifying method is performed during the process of providing the result of the electronic dictionary search translation via the screen, for further verifying whether the user's selected search word and the corresponding electronic dictionary search result information (a dictionary entry word or keyword) match each other. When there is a possibility that the output result of the electronic dictionary, on a search word recognized and selected from the original character image, is wrong, the verifying method as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> allows the user to instinctively verify the wrong result. Especially, since the search function may operate differently according to various kinds of electronic dictionaries, a user (who does not know the corresponding language) may not know whether the provided information is accurate. However, through the verification method as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, it is possible to solve the above described problem.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the verification method for determining whether a search word selected by the user matches the searched electronic dictionary keyword or entry word includes performing a comparison between a search word (i.e., an entry word that is queried for searching electronic dictionary DB) and a keyword (i.e., a searched result word in the dictionary DB) with each character, in step S<b>81</b>. In step S<b>82</b>, it is determined whether a search word corresponds to a keyword. In step S<b>83</b>, if the search word and keyword correspond, result verification completion information is transmitted In step S<b>84</b>, if the search word and keyword do not correspond, result verification failure information is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A to 15D</figref> illustrate an example of a screen display of an electronic dictionary database search result of a search word selected by the user, which illustrates a method of displaying the result of the entire or partial area of the character image, on the screen. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref> show screens displaying electronic dictionary database search results of the search word selected by the user, in which the screens provide the result of recognition of the entire or partial area of the character image. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, a dictionary keyword (or an entry word, <b>802</b>) searched from the electronic dictionary database is displayed with a semitransparent window, and the searched result <b>803</b> of the above mentioned dictionary keyword <b>802</b>, with an additional semitransparent window, is also provided to the user. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> shows the screen when the user selected only a part area <b>804</b> of the character image. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15C and 15D</figref> show screens displaying electronic dictionary DB search results of the search word selected by the user, in which in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref> the result is displayed on the lower area of the screen, and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15D</figref>, the result is displayed on the upper area of the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method for recognizing and translating a character image, according to a third embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a method for recognizing and translating a character image photographed by a camera attached to a portable terminal, and providing the result, according to a second embodiment of the present invention, includes the following steps. In step S<b>21</b>, a photographed image is stored and displayed on a screen. Step S<b>22</b> includes providing the character image photographed by the camera to the user via the screen in such a manner that he can select the image. Step S<b>23</b> includes recognizing characters included in an area to be recognized in the character image selected by the user in step S<b>22</b>, and storing the recognized individual characters. Step S<b>24</b> includes selecting an area to be translated on the character image provided via the screen. Step S<b>25</b> includes post-processing a character string included in the area selected in step S<b>24</b>, constructing candidate search words from individual characters included in the post-processed character string, and selecting a search word from among the candidate search words. Step S<b>26</b> includes providing a result searched from an electronic dictionary database, which corresponds to the search word selected in step S<b>25</b>, to the user. Step S<b>27</b> includes selectively operating or ending the electronic dictionary built in the portable terminal by the user. Steps S<b>28</b> to S<b>31</b> are similar to steps S<b>811</b> to S<b>814</b>, respectively, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In step S<b>22</b>, the user directly selects a character image area to be recognized, from the character image displayed on the screen device, and the selected area is stored and displayed on the character image on the screen device in such a manner that the user can easily recognize the area. In step S<b>23</b>, for the character image area corresponding to the area displayed on the screen, the characters included in the character image are recognized, and information on the character strings resulting from the character image recognition is stored to output or store the recognized individual characters as a digital character data type. In step S<b>24</b>, the location information of the user's selected to-be-translated area on the character image displayed on the screen device is stored, and one character string, which is located closest to the corresponding location information and exists in a location including the previously recognized/stored character information, is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In step S<b>25</b>, the one character string selected in step S<b>24</b> is post-processed to filter out numbers or special characters, except for characters, included in the character string, and then for the post-processed character string, candidate search words for searching an electronic dictionary database are constructed by using the individual characters included in the character string. Then, from among the searched candidate search words, a final electronic dictionary database search word is selected. In step S<b>26</b>, on the character image displayed on the screen, definition information of a dictionary entry word or keyword of a result searched from the electronic dictionary database, corresponding to the selected electronic dictionary database search word, is directly provided, and in step S<b>27</b>, the selected electronic dictionary database search word is used as an electronic dictionary entry word or keyword so that the user selectively operates or ends the electronic dictionary built in the portable terminal. This method according to an embodiment of the present invention may provide an effective method of translation in connection with an electronic dictionary of Chinese and Japanese words, and also, in some languages having no spaces between meaning words (for example, Korean compound nouns), the electronic dictionary-based translation result of individual meaning words of the corresponding compound noun word may be provided to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In this embodiment according to the present invention, it is possible to distinguish a search word to be actually translated by directly using the information from the electronic dictionary database built into the portable terminal, or other similar devices, and to obtain an accurate translation result by searching for the user's finally selected word in connection with the electronic dictionary database.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a flow chart illustrating step S<b>25</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. Step S<b>25</b> can be performed according to two kinds of methods. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> corresponds to a first one of the two methods.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Step S<b>25</b> includes setting, after the post-processing of a character string (whose location is selected by the user), a maximum character string length searchable from the electronic dictionary database, and constructing an electronic dictionary database candidate search character string including characters of the number of the maximum character string length, the characters starting from the left of the character corresponding to the user's selected location, in steps (d-<b>1</b>) (steps S<b>41</b>-S<b>44</b>); searching for the electronic dictionary database candidate search character string as a word, in connection with the electronic dictionary database, and determining whether or not the search result exists in the electronic dictionary database, in step (d-<b>2</b>) (steps S<b>45</b>-S<b>46</b>); updating, if the candidate search character string does not exist in the electronic dictionary database, the electronic dictionary database candidate search character string by changing the length of the candidate character string, and the characters included in the string, in step (d-<b>3</b>) (step S<b>47</b>); and searching for the updated electronic dictionary database candidate search character string, assumed to be a word, in connection with the electronic dictionary database, completing an electronic dictionary database search selection when there is an electronic dictionary database search result for the word-assumed character string, and providing the corresponding search result via the screen, in step (d-<b>4</b>) (step S<b>48</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Step (d-<b>1</b>) includes calling out a recognition character string including the character located most closely to the user's selected location on the screen in step S<b>41</b>, removing numbers and special characters from the recognized character string in step S<b>42</b>, setting the maximum character string length to construct a first word for an electronic dictionary database search in step S<b>43</b>, and constructing an electronic dictionary database candidate search character string corresponding to the set maximum character string length in step S<b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Step (d-<b>2</b>) includes searching for the candidate search character string, assuming it is a word, from the electronic dictionary database in step S<b>45</b>, and determining whether the searched word exists in the electronic dictionary database in step S<b>46</b>. After steps S<b>45</b> to S<b>47</b> are repeatedly performed, the information about the completion of the selection of the electronic dictionary database search word is transmitted, in step S<b>48</b>.</p>

The method as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is different from the method as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, in that it uses, instead of the location of the user's selected specific individual character, the entire corresponding character string including the location information of the individual character. In other words, for the entire corresponding character string including the location of the user's selected character, words constituting the corresponding character string are separated by using the information on a dictionary entry word or keyword of electronic dictionary database built in the portable terminal, and from the separated words, a word including the individual character of the user's first selected location area is selected as an electronic dictionary search word. Specifically, the method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> includes calling out a recognition character string including the character located most closely to the user's selected location on the screen, in step S<b>51</b>, removing numbers and special characters from the recognized character string in step S<b>52</b>, labeling the first to last of the character string based on an entry word searched from the electronic dictionary database, in step S<b>53</b>, constructing consecutive words by constructing the same-value labeled characters as one word in step S<b>54</b>, and selecting, from among the consecutive words, a word including the user's selected location information as a final electronic dictionary database search word, and transmitting completion information, in step S<b>55</b>.</p>
