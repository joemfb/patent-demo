<heading id="h-0001" level="1">PRIORITY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on and claims the benefit of priority from European Patent Application EP08153051.1 filed Mar. 20, 2008.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Applications deployed in a production environment must coexist in a common runtime environment, which is the operating system in which they have been installed. However, the installation of a new application typically damages an existing environment. As a result, already-tested applications can potentially conflict. Thus, greater IT resources are required to validate a production environment every time a new product is installed thereto or patched.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This may be addressed by using virtualization technology at the operating system level, e.g. VMWare. There are currently a number of products available like IBM Progressive Deployment System (PDS) (http://web.opensource.ibm.com/www/pds/) that use an application virtualization approach. Under this approach, while deployed applications share operating system and hardware settings with other applications, they also run in a virtual environment, working on their own private virtual files, directories and registries that define the application environment.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments of the invention include computer program products and systems for detecting a software application in a virtualization environment. In one embodiment of the invention, the system comprises computer program instructions for: storing the software application in a first repository; storing an identifier from an identifying component in a second repository, wherein the software application comprises the identifying component; providing a copy of the second repository to one or more recipient computers to form local identifier repositories; selecting one or more of the recipient computers; and extracting the identifier of the software application from the one or more local identifier repositories of the one or more selected recipient computers.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another embodiment of the invention, a system for detecting the installation of the software application in a virtualization environment is disclosed. The system for detecting the installation of the software application in a virtualized environment comprises computer program instructions for: storing the software application in a first repository; storing an identifier from an identifying component in a second repository, wherein the software application comprises the identifying component; providing a copy of the second repository to one or more recipient computers to form local identifier repositories; selecting one or more of the recipient computers; extracting the identifier of the software application from the one or more local identifier repositories of the one or more selected recipient computers; interrogating the one or more selected recipient computers to ascertain whether the one or more selected recipient computers contains a matching copy of the identifier; and determining if the software application is installed on one or more selected recipient computers, in the event that a matching copy of the identifier is found on the one or more selected recipient computers.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The extraction of the identifier of the software application, interrogation of the one or more selected computers, and the determination that the software product is installed on one or more selected recipient computer further comprises execution of these steps by an agent in the selected recipient computer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment of the invention, the system comprises computer program instructions for executing: the preceding steps of dividing the application into a plurality of application components; providing an identifying component for the application; and storing the application components and the identifying component in the first repository.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another embodiment of the invention, a system for detecting the usage of the software application in the virtualization environment is disclosed. The system for detecting the usage of the software application in the virtualization environment further comprises computer program instructions for: storing the software application in a first repository; storing an identifier from an identifying component in a second repository, wherein the software application comprises the identifying component; providing a copy of the second repository to one or more recipient computers to form local identifier repositories; selecting one or more of the recipient computers; extracting the identifier of the software application from the one or more local identifier repositories of the one or more selected recipient computers; interrogating a list of the processes currently running on the one or more selected recipient computers to ascertain whether the list comprises a matching copy of the identifier; and deciding that the one or more selected recipient computers is currently using the software application, in the event a matching copy is found.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The embodiments of the invention allow license tools to detect the installation of software that is not physically installed on a machine when an Application Virtualization Environments is used. Similarly, the embodiments of the invention allow license tools to detect the use of the software. In one embodiment of the invention, a new kind of signature, namely a virtual installation signature, may be defined. The virtual installation signature may be optionally used by a license tool to report installations performed in Application Virtualization Environments in a different way because the business meaning and cost of a virtualized installation is different from a regular one.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Implementations of the invention discussed above may include a system, and a computer program product. Another embodiment of the invention provides a service deployed in a data processing system.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">At present, a usage signature is used to determine if an application is running on a target machine and an installation signature is used to determine if the product is simply installed on the target machine. However, products that create Application Virtualization Environments do not register an installed application in operating system registries (i.e. through registry keys): and do not execute any kind of explicit installation action (i.e. launching an installer) that would track the product installation. This behavior prevents a classic, not-instrumented license tool from identifying installed software. Similarly, the products that create Application Virtualization Environments do not necessarily run an application executable file name and size in the manner it would in a normal environment. This behavior prevents a classic, not-instrumented license tool from identifying the software that is running on a machine.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Embodiments of the invention use elements of an Application Virtualization Environment to detect the installation and use of software. For the sake of example, an embodiment of the invention is described with reference to the IBM Progressive Deployment System (PDS). However, it will be appreciated that the embodiments of the invention may apply to other Application Virtualization Environments.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Using the above-mentioned IBM Progressive Deployment System (PDS), an embodiment of the invention is based on the IBM Tivoli License Compliance Manager architecture. As before, the IBM Tivoli License Compliance Manager is used only for the purposes of example. In particular, it will be understood that the embodiments of the invention are in no way limited to the IBM Tivoli License Manager. Instead, it will be understood that embodiments of the invention may apply to any license manager tool. The IBM Tivoli License Manager is a license tool that provides software inventory, use metering, and license allocation services on distributed platforms. All these functions base their recognition of software applications or products installed or, in use, on the information defined in a software catalog.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in one embodiment of the invention, a network employing a license manager <b>10</b> may have a three-tiered architecture comprising an administration center <b>12</b>, run-time servers <b>14</b> and target computers <b>16</b>. The administration center <b>12</b> may contain one or more catalogs, listing installation details (i.e. registry keys) and usage signatures (i.e. executable files). In use, copies of the catalogs may be downloaded to target computers <b>16</b> (to form local copies of the catalog(s)). Each target computer <b>16</b> may comprise at least one agent which detects software installation and use by matching the software with the details in the local copy of the catalog.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In Application Virtualization Environments, an application may be packaged into one or more packages (&#x201c;Assets&#x201d; in PDS). Each package contains a plurality of pieces (&#x201c;Shards&#x201d; in PDS) of the application, wherein an individual piece is known as a dice. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in one embodiment of the invention, individual dice may be retained in a shard repository <b>22</b>. Thus, in use, a user may create packages from the application dices stored in the repository. Each package also contains a main dice, which may contain relevant information about the product it represents and about the other dice, (in PDS, when the shards are stored in a &#x201c;shard repository&#x201d;, the main dice is called a &#x201c;root metashard&#x201d;). To ensure that the main dice uniquely identifies its application over all the other packaged applications, the main dice is a file whose name is an identifying signature.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, progressive download is a process in which the dices are downloaded one by one to a target computer <b>16</b>, according to the requirements of the relevant application. However, the main dice is the first to be downloaded to the target computer <b>16</b>. The main dice may be then stored locally on the recipient target computer <b>16</b> as a file whose name is that of the main dice itself. In most Application Virtualization Environments (like PDS), the executable file, once in execution, may be viewed as a process by other applications running as native applications (in PDS the name of the process is pds-&#x3c;name-of-the-exe-file&#x3e;).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment of the invention, the identifying signature of a main dice, present on a target computer <b>16</b> when a software application is deployed and executed therein, may be used to detect the installation of the application. In this embodiment of the invention, the identifying signature may be added to the catalog in the administration center <b>12</b>, as a new type of signature to identify &#x201c;virtualized installations&#x201d;. This so-called virtual installation signature flags that an application is virtually installed on a target machine and running therein. Thus, when a virtualized application is executed on a target machine for the first time, (and the main dice is downloaded and saved therein as a file), an agent in the recipient target machine may be able to discover this file in the target machine's file system and match it with a corresponding entry in the local copy of the catalog to detect the virtualized installation.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to one embodiment of the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in use, a first user <b>18</b> (e.g. systems administrator) may use (for example) a PDS preparer <b>20</b> to convert two (for example) applications (App<b>1</b>. App<b>2</b>) to two packages (Asset<b>1</b>, Asset<b>2</b>). The packages and associated main dice (Digest<b>1</b>, Digest<b>2</b>) for each application (App<b>1</b>, App<b>2</b>) are stored in the repository <b>22</b>. A server catalog (e.g. a TLCM catalog manager) is provided with two new entries, one for each dice, representing the products being monitored. At periodic intervals, copies of the catalog (and associated copies <b>26</b> of the main dice (Digest<b>1</b>, Digest<b>2</b>)) may be copied to potential target computers (not shown) for the applications.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In use, a second user's <b>28</b> browser (in a target machine) may be directed to the repository <b>22</b>, and the second user <b>28</b> may be shown a list <b>30</b> of all the available applications. When the user selects a particular application, the relevant dices are downloaded (e.g. through a PDS deliverer) to the target machine. When a minimal necessary set of dices have been downloaded to the target machine, the application may be then be run thereon. In one embodiment of the invention, an agent <b>32</b> on the target machine may perform, for example, a TLCM software scan of the target machine. During this scan, the agent <b>32</b> may compare the locally stored copy of the main dice with the local copy of identifying signatures in the catalog downloaded from the server catalog <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">One embodiment of the invention may also provide two mechanisms for detecting the use of software in an Application Virtualization Environment. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in one embodiment a virtualized application through a native process may be detected, in which the preferred embodiment looks at the active processes running on the target computer <b>34</b> (i.e. an agent on a target computer <b>34</b> obtains a list of active processes) to look for an application whose name matches that of the main dice (in the local [runtime] copy <b>40</b> of the master catalog <b>42</b>). In doing so, this approach may use a special logic to remove the effect of virtual environment modifications (i.e. cutting away &#x201c;pds-&#x201d; in PDS and retrieving the name of the original file).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another embodiment, the application of interest is instrumented. In other words, the application is modified by the vendor to advise the license manager when the application is starting. Thus, thus the license manager does not need to check the process list to determine whether the application is running.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Exemplary systems and computer program products for detecting the installation and usage of applications in a virtualized environment are described with reference to the accompanying drawings. The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention.
