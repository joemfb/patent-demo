<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is directed to a coupling assembly for use in connecting a supply conduit to a supply source. The invention is particularly directed to an anti-mismatch coupling assembly and medical air tube connection system for coupling an air supply tube to an air supply manifold to prevent incorrect connection of the supply tube to the required supply source.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Numerous types of couplings have been constructed for coupling a supply conduit to a supply source of a fluid such as a gas or liquid. Many of these couplings are provided with quick disconnect coupling members to enable efficient connection and disconnect from the source.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One example of a fluid supply is commonly used in hospitals and other medical facilities. The supply generally includes a manifold with several outlets for supplying air, oxygen, anesthesia, or other gases. A manifold is often provided in the hospital room which includes at least an oxygen and air supply. The oxygen and air supply typically include a coupling to enable quick and easy coupling of a supply tube to the air or oxygen source to feed air and/or oxygen to the patient through a mask or tube.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One example of a manifold or panel containing a plurality of fluid supplies enables the fluid supply to be connected to different devices. For example, pressure lines from a particular machine can be connected to the manifold and connected to the supply by a quick connect coupling. The coupling mechanism can often include a flow meter or measuring device for measuring the fluid pressure and flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Care must be taken when connecting a supply conduit to the fluid supply to ensure that the conduit is connected to the correct supply. The supply connections are typically identical so that the feed tube can inadvertently be connected to the incorrect supply. Although the supplies are labeled, errors often occur. There are many instances when the correct fluid is essential to the operation of the equipment or the safety of the patient. For example, in the hospital setting, it is important to ensure the supply of gas being fed to the patient is correctly connected to either the oxygen supply or the air supply as needed. Failure to connect the supply to the proper outlet can result in damage to the instrument or injury to the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various solutions have been provided to reduce the risk of incorrectly connecting the supply conduit to the outlet. Examples of various solutions have included color codes, labels and non-interchangeable quick connectors.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One example of a quick connect system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,170,667 to Szohatsky. The connection system includes a coupling having male and female members that are compatible to enable connection with each other. The system is a non-interchangeable coupling system where the female member includes an external sleeve having a groove that cooperates with the male member. The system also includes a quick connect coupling having a female member with a grooved sleeve mounted externally where the male member includes an external sleeve having a flange mating with the groove sleeve of the female member.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 4,696,326 to Sturgis discloses an anti-mismatch system for use in fluid conduits where a pair of fluid conduits include matching first and second conduits. The anti-mismatch system prevents the inadvertent connection of mismatched fluid conduits to the source. The anti-mismatch fittings are configured for inter-engagement only with one another and not with anti-mismatch fittings of a different set, thereby enabling connection only of the matching fluid conduits. The fittings are constructed having different axial lengths to prevent mismatch of the couplings to the incorrect fluid supply.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat. No. 4,619,640 to Potolsky et al. discloses a blood transfer connection assembly having a male and female connector. The connectors are constructed to prevent inadvertent connection to an incorrect blood type source. The male connector can include a key or prongs that mate with a corresponding recess in the female connector to ensure proper connection.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 5,971,972 to Rosenbaum discloses an intravenous infusion system having different connectors for connecting to a particular source. The different connectors prevent mismatch connection to prevent connecting to the improper blood source.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Various other coupling mechanisms have been developed which have a specific shape or dimension to mate with the appropriate coupling member. Examples of such devices are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,459,177 to Deuschle, U.S. Pat. No. 4,344,455 to Norton et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,582,166 to Lee, U.S. Pat. No. 5,787,879 to Gibson, U.S. Pat. No. 6,508,807 to Peters, U.S. Pat. No. 6,488,026 to Lauer, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,722,207 to Korkor.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">While the prior coupling systems have generally been successful for the intended use, there is a continuing need in the industry for an improved coupling system to prevent mismatch of fluid supplies.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention is directed to a medical air tubing connection and coupling assembly that prevents mismatch coupling of the supply conduit to the fluid source. The invention is particularly directed to an anti-mismatch coupling system that prevents inadvertent connection of a medical device to the improper supply.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The connector assembly of the present invention can be connected to a standard supply outlet without modification of the outlet. In one embodiment of the invention, the connector assembly of the invention includes an adapter permanently connected to the air supply outlet of a manifold or panel containing a plurality of outlets. A coupling member of a medical device is compatible only with the adapter on the fluid supply and is not compatible with the standard outlet of the manifold or panel. A second supply tube includes a coupling member that is compatible with the standard outlet and is not compatible with the coupling member of the invention. In a preferred embodiment, the adapter is fixed to the air supply in a manner that the adapter is tamper resistant and cannot be removed without damaging the adapter and the fluid supply.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The coupling member of the invention is an adapter that can be coupled directly to the outlet of the fluid supply of a manifold having a plurality of different fluid supply outlets. The adapter is preferably coupled to a fluid outlet to retrofit the existing fluid outlet and is fixed thereto to prevent removal. In one embodiment, the adapter is threaded onto the fluid outlet and is intended to be fixed to the fluid outlet by a locking member such as a set screw. The adapter has an inlet end connected to the supply outlet and an outlet end for connecting to the supply conduit. The outlet end has a shape and/or dimension that is different from the outlet of the manifold. A feed tube has a connector integrally formed therewith that is compatible with the adapter for coupling with the adapter where the coupling is not compatible with the outlet of the manifold. The feed tube has a second end integrally formed with a medical device such as a nebulizer. The second supply conduit is compatible with the outlet of the manifold but is not compatible with the outlet end of the adapter.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Accordingly, one aspect of the invention is to provide a coupling system that allows easy connection to the supply while preventing inadvertent mismatching of the connections.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another aspect of the invention is to provide a coupling where only compatible male and female members can be connected.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another aspect of the invention is to provide an anti-mismatch coupling system including an adapter that is permanently fixed to an air supply outlet of a supply manifold.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Another aspect of the invention is to provide a convenient and inexpensive anti-mismatch system that can be used to retrofit an existing supply manifold.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">These and other aspects of the invention are basically attained by providing a fluid distribution system comprising a first fluid supply for supply air and having an outlet with a first coupling end, a second fluid supply having an outlet with a second coupling end, and an adapter having a first end with a coupling end that is fixed to the first coupling end of the air supply. The first adapter has a second end with a second coupling end that is incompatible with the first coupling end and the second coupling end. A second adapter is coupled to one of the second fluid supply and has an outlet end with an outwardly facing gripping surface. A first feed assembly has a first connector that is compatible with the second coupling end of the adapter and incompatible with the second coupling end of the second fluid supply. The first feed line is fixed at the first end to the first connector and at a second end to a medical device such as a nebulizer. A second feed line has a second connector that is compatible with the second coupling end of the second fluid supply and is incompatible with the second coupling end of the adapter.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The various aspects of the invention are also attained by providing a fluid distribution system for supplying air and oxygen, comprising a first fluid supply having a first coupling end for supply air, a second fluid supply having a second coupling end for supplying oxygen, and a first adapter coupled to the first coupling ends. The adapter has an axial passage and outlet end with an axial recess defining a coupling member. A first feed assembly has a first connector connected to a first feed line. The first connector has a coupling end that can be removably coupled to the adapter and cannot be coupled to the second coupling member. A nebulizer is fixed to a second end of the first feed line.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The present invention is directed to an air tubing connection and fluid distribution system that prevents improper connection to a fluid source. The invention is particularly directed to a fluid distribution system that prevents mismatching of coupling members to reduce or eliminate the risk of inadvertently connecting a feed line to an incorrect fluid supply.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The fluid distribution system of the invention is suitable for use with a supply manifold or panel having a plurality of supply outlets that are able to supply a fluid and particularly a gas such as air and oxygen. The distribution system of the invention is suitable for use with a variety of fluids including liquids and gases. In the illustrated embodiment, the fluid distribution system is disclosed in connection with a supply of air and oxygen. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the gases are oxygen and/or air that are typically supplied in a hospital or other medical facility. The fluid distribution system of the invention prevents the inadvertent connection of the oxygen supply to an air feed line and prevents connection of the air supply to an oxygen feed line.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A typical supply system commonly used in hospitals and medical facilities is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The supply system <b>10</b> includes a panel <b>12</b> with a plurality of outlets having a flow meter <b>14</b> connected to each outlet. A coupling nipple <b>16</b> is connected to each of the oxygen and air supplies for connecting with a supply tube <b>18</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the conventional system provides interchangeable nipples <b>16</b> and tubes <b>18</b> such that each tube can be connected to either nipple thereby creating a significant risk of inadvertently connecting the tube <b>18</b> to the incorrect air or oxygen source.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the fluid distribution system <b>20</b> of the invention includes a distribution manifold <b>22</b> shown as a panel having a plurality of fluid outlets <b>24</b>. Fluid outlets <b>24</b> typically include a threaded coupling end for connecting to a valve or other distribution system. In the embodiment illustrated, each outlet <b>24</b> is connected to flow meters <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> to control the flow rate and pressure of the fluid being supplied. The flow control meter <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> are typically threaded onto the threaded end of the outlet <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The manifold <b>22</b> supplies a variety of different gases depending on the utility of the manifold. In one embodiment of the invention, manifold <b>22</b> provides a source of oxygen and a source of air. In other embodiments of the invention, different gases can also be supplied, such as nitrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Flow meters <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> in the illustrated embodiment are shown as being connected to an oxygen and air supply, respectively. Each flow meter is substantially identical so that the parts are identified by the same reference number. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, flow meters <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> includes a main body <b>28</b> connected to outlet <b>24</b> of manifold <b>22</b>. A gauge <b>30</b> extends upwardly from main body <b>28</b> to display the pressure and flow rate of gas passing through flow meter <b>26</b>. An adjustment valve <b>32</b> in main body <b>28</b> is used to adjust the flow rate and pressure. The threaded outlet <b>34</b> extends from main body <b>28</b> to dispense the gas to the desired source. Outlet <b>34</b> in the embodiment illustrated includes external threads <b>36</b> and an axial passage <b>38</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, axial passage <b>38</b> includes an internal frustoconical sealing surface <b>40</b> capable of mating with a coupling member.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A first adapter <b>42</b> is coupled to the outlet <b>34</b> of flow meter <b>26</b>. Adapter <b>42</b> has an inlet end <b>44</b> and an outlet end <b>46</b>. Adapter <b>42</b> in the embodiment illustrated has a substantially smooth cylindrical outer surface <b>48</b> and an axial passage <b>50</b> extending between inlet end <b>44</b> and outlet end <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, inlet end <b>44</b> of adapter <b>42</b> defines a recessed portion <b>52</b> and threaded inner walls <b>54</b>. Recessed portion <b>52</b> has a dimension to be coupled to outlet <b>34</b> by the corresponding threads <b>36</b> and <b>54</b>. In one embodiment of the invention, inlet end <b>54</b> of adapter <b>42</b> is compatible with each of the outlets <b>34</b> of the flow meters <b>26</b> so that adapter <b>42</b> can be coupled selectively to either one of the flow meters. In the embodiment illustrated, adapter <b>42</b> is coupled to the flow meter for supplying air.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Recessed portion <b>52</b> of adapter <b>42</b> has a bottom wall <b>56</b> encircling axial passage <b>50</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Axial passage <b>50</b> includes an inwardly extending annular flange <b>58</b> for supporting a seal <b>60</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref>, seal <b>60</b> has a cylindrical side wall <b>62</b>, an axial passage <b>64</b>, and a frustoconical top end <b>66</b> for mating with the sealing surface <b>40</b> of outlet <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Adapter <b>42</b> is generally made of a rigid material such as stainless steel, although other materials can also be used. Seal <b>60</b> is generally a softer material capable of forming a fluidtight seal against sealing surface <b>40</b> when compressed against sealing surface <b>40</b>. Seal <b>60</b> can be made of a metal such as brass or a polymeric material such as nylon. Adapter <b>42</b> in the embodiment illustrated includes flat planar recesses <b>68</b> in the outer side wall for receiving a wrench or other tool to tighten adapter <b>42</b> onto outlet <b>34</b> with sufficient force to axially compress seal <b>60</b> and form a fluidtight seal between outlet <b>34</b> and adapter <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Outlet end <b>46</b> of adapter <b>42</b> includes an axial face with a pair of axially extending tabs <b>72</b>. Axial passage <b>50</b> at outlet end <b>46</b> defines a first inner cylindrical section <b>74</b> and a second inner cylindrical section <b>76</b> separated by a step <b>78</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref>, first cylindrical section <b>74</b> has a diameter less than the diameter of second cylindrical section <b>76</b>. The axial end of second cylindrical section <b>76</b> includes two stepped portions <b>80</b> with progressively larger internal diameters.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Inlet end <b>54</b> of adapter <b>42</b> includes a threaded bore <b>81</b> for receiving a threaded screw <b>83</b>. Threaded bore <b>81</b> extends radially through the side of adapter <b>42</b> into recessed portion <b>52</b>. Threaded bore <b>81</b> is oriented to align with the threaded outlet <b>36</b> of the flow meter <b>26</b>. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, adapter <b>42</b> is threaded onto the threaded end of the flow meter and the screw <b>83</b> is tightened to bite into the threaded end of the flow meter to secure the adapter permanently to the flow meter. In this manner, the adapter cannot be removed without great effort and without damaging the threads and/or the adapter. Preferably, the head of the screw <b>83</b> is recessed or flush with the outer surface of the adapter so as not to be readily accessible, thereby inhibiting tampering. In one preferred embodiment, a label <b>85</b> or other covering is applied over the screw head so that the screw is not visible under normal use. The label or cover deters tampering by obscuring the screw and provides evidence of tampering in the event an attempt is made to remove the adapter. In the embodiment shown, screw <b>83</b> provides a locking system to attach the adapter permanently to the flow meter. In other embodiments, other locking members can be used that are capable of preventing or inhibiting the removal of the adapter from the flow meter.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A first fluid feed line <b>82</b> includes a coupling member <b>84</b> for coupling with adapter <b>42</b>. First fluid feed line <b>82</b> is typically a flexible plastic tubing that leads to a nebulizer, mask, hood or other medical device for supplying air to a patient. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, feed line <b>82</b> is preferably fixed permanently to coupling member <b>84</b> for easy connection to adapter <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The fluid distribution system in a preferred embodiment provides an adapter coupled to an air supply where the adapter coupling is permanently attached to the air supply outlet. In a preferred embodiment, a nebulizer <b>91</b> is permanently fixed to one end of the feed line <b>82</b> that serves as a supply tube. The coupling member <b>84</b> is able to mate with the adapter <b>42</b> only so that the medical device cannot be inadvertently connected to an incorrect fluid supply. The medical device such as the nebulizer <b>91</b>, supply tubing <b>82</b> and coupling member <b>84</b> form a one piece integral feed assembly for the air. Preferably, the coupling member and nebulizer are fused to the tube <b>82</b> and cannot be separated without damaging or destroying the feed assembly, the adapter and the nebulizer.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 8</figref>, coupling member <b>84</b> has a shape and dimension that is compatible with the recess in the outlet end <b>46</b> of adapter <b>42</b>. In the embodiment illustrated, outlet end <b>46</b> of adapter <b>42</b> defines a female end and the coupling member <b>84</b> of feed line <b>82</b> defines a male member for coupling with adapter <b>42</b>. Coupling member <b>84</b> is preferably a unitary one piece member made of rigid but resilient plastic material that is able to form a fluidtight seal with the adapter.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Coupling member <b>84</b> has a longitudinal dimension with an axial passage <b>86</b>, a coupling end <b>88</b> and a base <b>90</b>. Base <b>90</b> has a substantially cylindrical shape with an open end fixed to feed line <b>82</b>. Preferably, base <b>90</b> is permanently fixed to feed line <b>82</b> by welding, the use of adhesive or other coupling means that prevents separation of the coupling member from feed line <b>82</b> without damaging the assembly and rendering the assembly inoperable. Base <b>90</b> has a collar <b>92</b> that extends radially outward from base <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the first feed line <b>82</b> has a first end fixed to coupling member <b>84</b> and second end fixed to the nebulizer <b>91</b>. The coupling member <b>84</b>, feed line <b>82</b> and nebulizer <b>91</b> form a one piece, integrally formed unit where the coupling member and nebulizer cannot be separated. The nebulizer <b>91</b> can be connected to a tube <b>93</b> which is connected to a mask <b>95</b>. In one embodiment, the mask <b>95</b> and tube can be permanently fused to the nebulizer to form a one piece unit. Nebulizer <b>91</b> functions in a conventional manner to supply a medicament to a patient through a mask by vaporizing the medicament. The nebulizer has a construction similar to conventional nebulizers. Fixing the feed line <b>82</b> and coupling member <b>84</b> to the nebulizer or other medical device prevents the assembly from being coupled to a non-specific or universal coupling member and prevents inadvertently coupling to an oxygen or other fluid supply. Providing a unitary assembly of the nebulizer, tube and coupling member and an adapter that mates only with the coupling member of the unitary assembly, reduces or substantially eliminates the risk of inadvertently connecting the nebulizer to the oxygen supply.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Coupling end <b>88</b> of adapter <b>84</b> has a cylindrical distal portion <b>94</b>, an intermediate portion <b>96</b>, and a cylindrical base portion <b>98</b>. Distal portion <b>94</b> has a cylindrical shape with an axial length complementing the axial length of first inner cylindrical section <b>74</b> of adapter <b>42</b>. Distal portion <b>94</b> has an outer diameter that is compatible with the inner diameter of first cylindrical section <b>74</b> to form a seal therebetween. The outer surface of distal portion <b>94</b> is provided with at least one annular rib <b>100</b> extending radially outward to contact the inner surface of first cylindrical section <b>74</b> and form a fluidtight seal. As shown, two axially spaced apart ribs <b>100</b> are provided, although any number of ribs can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Intermediate portion <b>96</b> of coupling <b>84</b> has a frustoconical outer end <b>102</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the step <b>78</b> includes a frustoconical inner edge <b>104</b> for mating with the frustoconical end <b>102</b> of intermediate portion <b>96</b>. Intermediate portion <b>96</b> has a substantially cylindrical shape with at least one outwardly extending sealing rib <b>106</b>. Rib <b>106</b> preferably extends radially outward a distance to contact the inner surface of the second inner cylindrical section <b>76</b> of adapter <b>42</b>. Intermediate section <b>96</b> preferably has an axial length corresponding substantially to the axial length of cylindrical section <b>76</b> and has an outer diameter complementing the inner diameter of cylindrical section <b>76</b> to form a fluidtight seal.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the cylindrical section <b>76</b> of adapter <b>42</b> has an inner diameter less than the inner diameter of the axial passage at the outlet end <b>46</b>. A cylindrical section <b>108</b> is formed at the outlet end <b>46</b> of adapter <b>42</b> and is separated from the cylindrical section <b>76</b> by a step <b>110</b>. Step <b>110</b> includes a frustoconical shaped portion <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Base portion <b>98</b> of coupling member <b>84</b> includes a cylindrical outer surface <b>114</b> with a frustoconical end <b>116</b> and an annular rib <b>118</b>. Annular rib <b>118</b> extends radially outward from outer surface <b>114</b>. Frustoconical shaped end <b>116</b> has a shape and dimension compatible with the frustoconical portion <b>112</b> of step <b>110</b> to mate together and form a sealing surface. Rib <b>118</b> has an outer dimension complementing the inner dimension of steps <b>80</b> of adapter <b>42</b> to form a seal.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Coupling member <b>84</b> is preferably a one piece integrally formed member. Coupling member <b>84</b> is preferably made of a plastic material having a resilience sufficient to couple to adapter <b>42</b> and form a fluidtight sealing surface. In one embodiment of the invention, coupling member <b>84</b> is made of a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a second adapter <b>120</b> is connected to flow meter <b>27</b> for supplying a different fluid from flow meter <b>26</b>. Adapter <b>120</b> is preferably made of a rigid material such as metal or plastic. Preferably, the second adapter <b>120</b> is connected to one fluid supply while the adapter <b>42</b> is connected to the other fluid supply. Adapter <b>120</b> has a body <b>122</b> with an axial passage <b>124</b>. A collar <b>126</b> having internal threads <b>128</b> is provided for coupling with the external threads on the outlet <b>34</b> of the flow meter <b>27</b>. The axial end of body <b>122</b> has a frustoconical edge <b>130</b> for mating with the frustoconical surface of the outlet of the flow meter for forming a seal. The outer surface of body <b>122</b> includes angled outwardly extending ribs <b>132</b> or barbs. A feed line <b>134</b> includes a coupling member <b>136</b> having an axial passage <b>138</b> with an internal dimension complementing the outer dimension of body <b>122</b> of adapter <b>120</b>. Coupling member <b>136</b> is pressed onto the body <b>122</b> to couple the feed line <b>134</b> to adapter <b>120</b>. Ribs <b>132</b> grip the inner surface of coupling member <b>136</b>. Coupling member <b>136</b> is preferably made from a resilient plastic material that is able to grip adapter <b>120</b> and form a fluidtight seal.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The distribution system of the invention prevents the inadvertent connection of a feed tube to the incorrect fluid supply and ensures proper connection of the feed line to the correct fluid supply. In the embodiment illustrated in the invention, flow meters provide a source of oxygen and a source of air. The adapter for the air supply is permanently connected to the flow meter of the air supply so that the feed lines can be connected only to the appropriate source. In the embodiment illustrated, adapter <b>42</b> is coupled to the air supply and flow meter <b>26</b>. Adapter <b>42</b> includes a female inlet end that is connected to the outlet of the flow meter and includes a female outlet end that is able to mate only to coupling <b>84</b>. The adapter <b>120</b> includes a female inlet end coupled to the outlet of the flow meter <b>27</b> and includes a male outlet end that is able to mate only with coupling <b>136</b>. Thus, the outlet ends of the adapters <b>42</b> and <b>120</b> are not compatible and the feed lines are not interchangeable. The feed line for the oxygen supply is provided with the coupling member <b>84</b> that is not compatible with adapter <b>42</b>. Thus, the feed line for the air supply cannot be inadvertently connected to the oxygen supply. In the same manner, the feed line for the oxygen is coupled to the coupling member <b>136</b> which can only be coupled to the end of the adapter <b>120</b>. The coupling member <b>136</b> is not compatible with the end of the adapter <b>48</b> so that the oxygen feed line cannot be inadvertently connected to the oxygen supply.</p>
