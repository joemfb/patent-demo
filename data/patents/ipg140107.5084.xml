<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A communication system is provided which includes different kinds of base stations such as a macro base station and a femto base station. This system may execute a method for controlling unfavorably occurring interference due to such different kinds of base stations. In the method, the femto base station sends a femtocell interference indication (FII) report to the resource allocation control unit when user equipment is connected to the femto base station. The FII report contains a request for the allocation of resources to avoid interference. Then the resource allocation control unit establishes a femto interference coordination (FIC) zone according to the received FII report. The FIC zone indicates a particular region used to define resources allocated to the femto base station. The resource allocation control unit may be the macro base station or a self-organizing network (SON) server.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates, in general, to mobile communication technology and, more particularly, to a communication system composed of different kinds of base stations such as a macro base station and a femto base station and a method for controlling unfavorable interference, occurring due to the different kinds of base stations.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Normally a femtocell refers to a small cell that covers a very small range in a cellular system. A small cellular base station for controlling such femtocells is referred to as a femto base station or Home Node B (HNB). Such a femto base station is designed as a base station for use in residential or small business environments. Since a femtocell generally operates in an environment where a macro cell is also operating, unfavorable interference may often occur depending on the location of user equipment such as a mobile communication device, e.g., a cellular telephone. An example is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view illustrating a conventional communication environment in which interference occurs between a macro base station and a femto base station.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the first femtocell A controlled by the first femto base station <b>100</b><i>a </i>(also referred to as HNB A) and the second femtocell B controlled by the second femto base station <b>100</b><i>b </i>(also referred to as HNB B) are located between the first macrocell A controlled by the first macro base station <b>200</b><i>a </i>and the second macrocell B controlled by the second macro base station <b>200</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additionally, certain user equipment <b>300</b><i>a </i>(also shown as UE macro) is located in the first macro cell. In the first femtocell A, certain user equipment <b>300</b><i>b </i>(also shown as UE A<b>1</b>) is located near the first macro cell, and another user equipment <b>300</b><i>c </i>(also shown as UE A<b>2</b>) is located near the first femto base station <b>100</b><i>a</i>. Also, user equipment <b>300</b><i>d </i>(also shown as UE B<b>1</b>) is located in the second femtocell, and user equipment <b>300</b><i>f </i>(also shown as UE macro) is located near the second femtocell in the second macro cell.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, dotted lines indicate a downlink of data transmission from a base station to user equipment, and solid lines indicate an uplink of data transmission from user equipment to a base station.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A certain uplink between the first macro base station <b>200</b><i>a </i>and user equipment <b>300</b><i>a </i>may be affected by interference with another uplink, indicated by number 1, between the first macro base station <b>200</b><i>a </i>and user equipment <b>300</b><i>b</i>. Furthermore, a certain downlink between the second macro base station <b>200</b><i>b </i>and user equipment <b>300</b><i>f </i>may be affected by interference with another downlink, indicated by number 2, between the second femto base station <b>100</b><i>b </i>and user equipment <b>300</b><i>f. </i></p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to control such interference between a macro base station and a femto base station, various methods have been studied in the art. For instance, widely used methods of controlling such interference are a power control method which regulates the transmission power (also referred to as Tx power) of a femto base station, an adaptive Tx on/off method which turns on the transmission power of a femto base station when the user equipment approaches a femtocell, and a radio resource management (RRM) method in an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Among them, an adaptive Tx on/off method is implemented as follows. A femto base station is composed of a transmission terminal for transmitting data and a reception terminal for receiving data. A femto base station monitors the reception signal strength from user equipment while turning off the power of a transmission terminal and turning on the power of a reception terminal. When a user equipment approaches a femtocell, a femto base station checks the reception signal strength of the approaching user equipment at a reception terminal. If the signal strength is more than a threshold value, the femto base station turns on the power of the transmission terminal in order to reduce interference.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Meanwhile, an RRM-based method controls interference by appropriately allocating resources to a femto base station and a macro base station. In this case, resources of the femto base station and the macro base station are allocated through a scheduler at the macro base station.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Unfortunately, such conventional methods for controlling interference have some shortcomings. For instance, since interference in user equipment due to a femto base station may occur irregularly, it is difficult to react to interference at a suitable time. Additionally, because it may be unclear which femto base station influences an user equipment by interference, it is difficult to properly allocate resources to a femto base station and a macro base station.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, the present invention is addresses the above-mentioned problems and/or disadvantages and provides at least the advantages described below.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Furthermore, well known or widely used techniques, elements, structures, and processes may not be described or illustrated in detail to avoid obscuring the essence of the present invention. Although the drawings represent embodiments of the invention, the drawings are not necessarily to scale and certain features may be exaggerated or omitted in order to better illustrate and explain the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Among terms set forth herein, a self-organizing network server (hereinafter will be referred to as an SON server) refers to a network element, which registers each individual base station accessing a network and also has functions such as cell optimization and cell operation. An SON server may be also referred to as an Operation and Maintenance (O&#x26;M) server. Particularly, an SON server may deliver information between a femto base station and a macro base station, and function as a resource allocation control unit.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic view illustrating a communication system which is composed of a macro base station, a femto base station, and an SON server in order to control interference in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the macro base station <b>200</b> and the femto base station <b>100</b> may transmit and receive a signal through the SON server <b>400</b>. Particularly, the femto base station <b>100</b> sends a Femtocell Interference Indication (FII) report to the SON server <b>400</b> when a connection is established with any user equipment <b>310</b><i>d </i>entering into its own femtocell coverage area. The FII report contains information used to notify neighboring user equipment or the macro base station <b>200</b> that interference may occur due to the femto base station <b>100</b>. The FII report may be formed as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">1) Features: Information for requesting the resource allocation of a particular region to avoid interference since such interference may be invoked in neighboring user equipments or the macro base station due to Tx power-on of the femto base station <b>100</b> connected with any user equipment;</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">2) Transmission Target: The SON server <b>400</b> or the macro base station <b>200</b> controlling a macro cell where the femto base station <b>100</b> is located;</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">3) Transmission Condition: Applies where the Tx power of the femto base station <b>100</b> is turned on;</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">4) Transmission Cycle: Event driven or periodic; and</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">5) Containing Information: Femtocell ID, Femtocell group ID, Tx/Rx power-on information, location information, power masking information, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Here, power masking information refers to information about a frequency band required for executing a communication function at each of the user equipments located near a femtocell.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The SON server <b>400</b> receiving the FII report establishes a Femto Interference Coordination (FIC) zone. Here, the FIC zone refers to a particular region used to define resources allocated respectively to the femto base station <b>100</b> and the macro base station <b>200</b>. The FIC zone will be described in detail referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">After establishing the FIC zone, the SON server <b>400</b> sends information about the FIC zone to the macro base station <b>200</b> and the femto base station <b>100</b>. At this time, the SON server <b>400</b> allocates a frequency band (also referred to as a femto band) to the femtocell.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The macro base station <b>200</b> can allocate downlink/uplink resources to the user equipment by using the FIC zone. Specifically, the macro base station <b>200</b> performs scheduling to allocate normal resources to certain user equipments <b>310</b><i>a </i>and <b>310</b><i>b </i>located in its own macro cell coverage area. However, with respect to a specific user equipment <b>310</b><i>c </i>which is located in the macro cell and also is near the femtocell, the macro base station <b>200</b> performs femtocell interference mitigation scheduling by referring resources in the FIC zone. That is, the macro base station <b>200</b> allocates specific one of remaining resources except resources in the FIC zone to user equipment <b>310</b><i>c </i>adjacent to the femtocell. Such resource allocation makes it possible to prevent an overlap between a resource allocated to a user equipment in the femtocell coverage area and a resource allocated to a user equipment adjacent to the femtocell. Accordingly, a downlink or uplink between such user equipment <b>310</b><i>c </i>and the macro base station <b>200</b> may not be affected by interference due to the femto base station <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The FIC zone, which is created by the SON server <b>400</b> in order to minimize interference caused by the activation of the femto base station <b>100</b>, may be removed when the Tx power of the femto base station <b>100</b> is turned off. Therefore, the femto base station <b>100</b> should notify the SON server <b>400</b> that the Tx power is turned off. A related process will be described below in relation to in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example of an FIC zone in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the FIC zone indicates resource regions allocated to the femto base station <b>100</b> by a resource allocation control unit, such as the macro base station or the SON server, which controls the allocation of resources. If resources which may be allocated to the macro cell and the femtocell include ten regions, for example, two of them may be allocated to the FIC zone as shown. Also, the FIC zone may be varied depending on the FII report received from the femto base station <b>100</b> with Tx power-on. In other words, the FIC zone may be established in a different configuration depending on the FII report and power masking information delivered at the request of the macro base station <b>200</b> or the SON server <b>400</b>. For instance, if a resource is a frequency band and a frequency bandwidth allocable to the macro cell and the femtocell is 500 MHz, and power masking information tells that user equipment has a frequency bandwidth of 200 MHz, then a frequency band of 200 MHz may be allocated to the FIC zone while leaving the others (i.e., 300 MHz) for the macro base station.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic view illustrating a communication system which is composed of a macro base station, a femto base station, and an SON server in order to remove an FIC zone in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, information between the macro base station <b>200</b> and the femto base station <b>100</b> may be transmitted and received through the SON server <b>400</b>. Particularly, the femto base station <b>100</b> turns off Tx power when user equipment <b>310</b><i>d </i>is released from a connection through handover to another cell. Here, the femto base station <b>100</b> sends a Femtocell Interference Free (FIF) report to the SON server <b>400</b> just before Tx power is turned off. The FIF report contains information used to notify the neighboring macro base station <b>200</b> that interference due to the femto base station <b>100</b> may not occur anymore. The FIF report may be formed as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">1) Features: Information for requesting the resource recovery of an allocated region since no interference may be invoked in neighboring user equipment or the macro base station due to Tx power-off of the femto base station <b>100</b> which has been disconnected with user equipment;</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">2) Transmission Target: The SON server <b>400</b> or the macro base station <b>200</b> controlling a macro cell where the femto base station <b>100</b> is located;</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The SON server <b>400</b> receives the FIF report removes the FIC zone. Thereafter, the SON server <b>400</b> sends information about the removal of the FIC zone to the macro base station <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The SON server <b>400</b> may establish or remove the FIC zone by using the FII report or the FIF report delivered whenever the Tx power of the femto base station <b>100</b> is turned on or off. Additionally, the macro base station <b>200</b> may flexibly allocate resources to a user equipment by using the FIC zone. Since resources allocated to the user equipment are flexibly varied, unfavorable interference due to the femto base station <b>100</b> may be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Now, an interference control method will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a method for controlling interference in a communication system composed of a macro base station, a femto base station, and an SON server in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when the Tx power is turned on in step <b>510</b>, the femto base station <b>100</b> sends the FII report to the SON server <b>400</b> in step <b>515</b>. Here, the Tx power of the femto base station <b>100</b> may be turned on when a user equipment is connected to the femto base station <b>100</b> through handover. As discussed above, the FII report contains information for requesting the resource allocation of a particular region since Tx power-on of the femto base station <b>100</b> may invoke interference in neighboring user equipments or the macro base station.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The SON server <b>400</b> receiving the FII report sends a scanning request signal to the femto base station <b>100</b> in step <b>520</b>. The scanning request signal is used to estimate communication environments surrounding the femto base station <b>100</b>. After receiving the scanning request signal, the femto base station <b>100</b> checks the strength of a frequency band that the neighboring user equipment uses. Then the femto base station <b>100</b> sends power masking information to the SON server <b>400</b> in step <b>525</b>. The power masking information corresponds to the strength of a frequency band. If necessary, the power masking information may be contained in the FII report sent in step <b>515</b>. In this case, steps <b>520</b> and <b>525</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Next, the SON server <b>400</b> establishes the FIC zone, depending on the power masking information (step <b>530</b>). As discussed above, the FIC zone indicates a particular region defined to minimize interference, which occurs in a downlink or uplink between user equipment and the macro base station <b>200</b> due to the femto base station <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Thereafter, the SON server <b>400</b> allocates a frequency band (also referred to as a femto band) to the femto base station <b>100</b> by using the FIC zone in step <b>535</b>. Then the femto base station <b>100</b> checks the allocated femto band and sends an acknowledgement (ACK) signal to the SON server <b>400</b> in step <b>540</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Also, the SON server <b>400</b> sends information about the FIC zone to the macro base station <b>200</b> in step <b>545</b>. Then, by using the received information about the FIC zone, the macro base station <b>200</b> may allocate resources to the user equipment connected thereto. At this time, the macro base station <b>200</b> may perform resource allocation to the user equipment adjacent to the femtocell by using remaining resources except for the resources allocated to the FIC zone. Also, the SON server <b>400</b> sends an updated neighbor cell list (NCL) to the macro base station <b>200</b> in step <b>550</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">On the other hand, if the user equipment connected to the femto base station <b>100</b> is disconnected through handover to another cell, the femto base station <b>100</b> turns off the Tx power in step <b>560</b>. Then the femto base station <b>100</b> sends the FIF report to the SON server <b>400</b> in step <b>565</b>. As discussed above, the FIF report contains information notifying the SON server that the femto base station <b>100</b> is no longer transmitting.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">After receiving the FIF report, the SON server <b>400</b> removes the FIC zone in step <b>570</b>. Thereafter, although not illustrated, the SON server <b>400</b> sends information about the removal of the FIC zone to the macro base station <b>200</b>. Then the macro base station <b>200</b> may cancel the use of the FIC zone established for the user equipment adjacent to the femtocell. Also, the SON server <b>400</b> sends an updated NCL to the macro base station <b>200</b> so that the macro base station <b>200</b> may update information about neighbor base stations.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Described previously are a method for controlling interference through the SON server <b>400</b>, and a communication system for executing such a method. Now, another method and communication system for interference control based on direct communication between the femto base station <b>100</b> and the macro base station <b>200</b> will be described referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 9</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Further, although the user equipment may have no GPS-related information, the SON server <b>400</b> or the macro base station <b>200</b> can minimize interference through the FIC zone which is varied according to Tx power on/off of the femto base station <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As fully discussed hereinbefore, the present invention makes it possible to allocate a resource, in advance, to the femto base station since the SON server or the macro base station already knows a time when interference occurs due to the femto base station.
