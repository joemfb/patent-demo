<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to electronic devices, and particularly to a sliding module for an electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Portable electronic devices such as mobile phones, laptops, and personal digital assists (PDAs) are widely used. As such, the sales and use of slide-type portable electronic devices have been on the increase. A slide-type portable electronic device has two housings, which can open and close relative to each other with the use of a slide mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the slide-type devices typically only allow the two housings to slide parallel to each other. Therefore, when the slide-type is placed horizontally, it can be difficult for users to view a display screen on the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there is room for improvement within the art.</p>

When the cam <b>45</b> slides over the peaks of the follower <b>44</b>, the cam <b>45</b> automatically rotates the assist lever <b>50</b> until the first section <b>10</b> is completely opened relative to the second section <b>20</b>. The first section <b>10</b> is supported in a tilted position relative to the second section <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The sliding module <b>100</b> can be applied in a portable electronic device such as a mobile phone. The electronic device includes a cover and a housing engagable with the cover. The cover is secured to the first section <b>10</b>, and the housing is secured to the second section <b>20</b>. Thus, the portable electronic device opens or closes with use of the sliding module <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">There are many advantages to having the hinge module <b>40</b> assembled to the assist lever <b>50</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a lever arm of a force of rotating the assist lever <b>50</b> is L<b>1</b> when the hinge module <b>40</b> is assembled to the assist lever <b>50</b>. A lever arm of a force of rotating the pivot plate <b>30</b> is L<b>2</b> when the hinge module <b>40</b> is assembled to the pivot plate <b>30</b>. Since L<b>1</b> is longer than L<b>2</b>, when a predetermined moment of force is applied, the force of rotating the assist lever <b>50</b> is relative small. The operation is easier. In addition, if the hinge module <b>40</b> is assembled to the pivot plate <b>30</b>, a coaxial degree of the second hinged ends <b>362</b> and the hinge module <b>40</b> is required. Since the hinge module <b>40</b> is made of a plurality of components, it is difficult to satisfy this coaxial degree requirement. However, when the hinge module <b>40</b> is assembled to the assist lever <b>50</b>, the assembly process is relatively easy.</p>
