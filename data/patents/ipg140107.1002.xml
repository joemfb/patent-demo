<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a clutch drum being part of a centrifugal clutch for an internal combustion engine, the centrifugal clutch being arranged to transmit a rotational motion of a crank shaft at higher engine speed and to declutch at lower engine speed, the clutch drum comprising a peripheral portion, with thickness B, which is arranged to be engaged on the inside by weighted arms of a driving disc at higher engine speed, and an end portion, with thickness A, joining a drum hub and the peripheral portion.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In most hand-held power tools a centrifugal clutch is interposed between a driving engine and the actual tool. This is the case where the engine is an internal combustion engine. At lower engine speed the centrifugal clutch is disengaged and the tool is inactive. When the driven part of the tool, e.g. a saw chain, is to be activated the engine rpm is increased and this increases the centrifugal force acting on a movable member of the centrifugal clutch and clutch engagement results.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, such a centrifugal clutch has a driving disc, fixedly connected to the crank shaft via a hub, said driving disc having weighted arms or shoes. The centrifugal clutch further comprises a cup shaped clutch drum, surrounding the driving disc. The clutch drum is fixedly connected to a drum hub, which in turn is drivingly connected to a driven implement or tool. The cup shaped clutch drum is engaged by the weighted arms of the driving disc at higher engine speed and a rotational motion can be transmitted to the tool or implement via said drum hub.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For a hand-held power tool weight is a prime concern as the operator carries the tool during work. Every gram that can be saved is therefore important. Also the size of the tool is very important to make the tool more manoeuvrable and light. Therefore these tools are normally driven by compact and light two stroke engines.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically, the clutch drum is formed by drawing sheet metal with a thickness of approximately 1.8 mm. This thickness is used so that the peripheral portion can withstand the load from the weighted arms at maximum engine speed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For a chainsaw the minimum width of the clutch drum is limited by a necessary minimum width of an outer cylindrical area of the peripheral portion contacted by a brake band. Commonly, the brake band is freely wound around the peripheral portion of the clutch drum so as to being able to instantly stop the clutch drum, and thereby also the chain, through friction, when the chain brake is actuated.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A disadvantage of the aforementioned clutch drum is its rather high weight and its large width.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to provide a clutch drum with reduced width and weight.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another object of the present invention is to provide a hand-held power tool with reduced width and weight, taking advantage of the reduced width of the clutch drum.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is also an object of the present invention to provide a hand-held power tool working farther from the resonant frequency of the crank shaft system.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These objects are reached by a clutch drum of the type mentioned initially, wherein the thickness of the end portion, A, is less than the thickness of the peripheral portion, B.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Reducing the thickness A means that the total width of the clutch drum and the centrifugal clutch can be reduced. Thereby the weight of the centrifugal clutch can be reduced and also the width and weight of the whole hand-held power tool. This implies a light weight and versatile hand-held power tool, being easy to operate. Also, reducing the width of the centrifugal clutch enables a shorter crankshaft, which implies that the resonant frequency of the crank shaft system is displaced away from the working frequency. More specifically, the resonant frequency is shifted upwards.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, reducing the width of the centrifugal clutch enables its centre of gravity to be displaced towards the centre of gravity of the crank shaft, which also implies the resonant frequency of the crank shaft system to be shifted upwards. Moreover, the reduced weight of the centrifugal clutch also contributes to the shifting upwards of the resonant frequency. Running farther from the resonant frequency is very beneficial for a hand-held power tool since it implies less vibration, less noise and an increased service life time.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a cross sectional view of an internal combustion engine <b>1</b> with a crank shaft <b>2</b> being connected to a centrifugal clutch <b>4</b>. The centrifugal clutch <b>4</b> has a driving disc <b>5</b>, fixedly connected to the crank shaft <b>2</b> via a hub <b>6</b>, said driving disc <b>5</b> having weighted arms or shoes. The centrifugal clutch <b>4</b> further comprises a cup shaped clutch drum <b>7</b>, surrounding the driving disc <b>5</b>. The clutch drum <b>7</b> comprises a cylinder shaped peripheral portion <b>8</b> disposed so as to having a central axis along the central axis <b>3</b> of the crank shaft <b>2</b>, and an end portion <b>9</b> forming a bottom of said clutch drum <b>7</b>. The end portion <b>9</b> is fixedly connected to a drum hub <b>13</b> at its centre, which drum hub <b>13</b> being mounted for rotation about the crank shaft <b>2</b> and is journaled in a needle bearing <b>14</b> or ball bearings. Alternatively, the drum hub <b>13</b> can be arranged to be fixedly mounted on an output shaft, e.g. by a spline connection. This is often the case for trimmers. The drum hub <b>13</b> can further be connected to a drive sprocket <b>15</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) for driving a saw chain, said drive sprocket <b>15</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) can e.g. be a rim sprocket, which is arranged to be sideways displaceable and drivingly connected by e.g. splines to the drum hub <b>13</b>. Alternatively, the drive sprocket <b>15</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) can be e.g. a spur sprocket, which means the drum hub <b>13</b> is rigidly and directly connected to the saw chain, having no other transmitting means interposed between the drum hub <b>13</b> and the saw chain. Preferably, the drum hub <b>13</b> and the spur sprocket are cast in one piece. Alternatively, the drum hub <b>13</b> can be connected to a belt pulley intended to drive a belt for a cut off saw. At higher engine speed the weighted arms or shoes of the driving disc <b>5</b> are forced radially outwards by the centrifugal force to the extent of engaging the inside of the peripheral portion <b>8</b>, thus permitting a rotational motion of the driving disc <b>5</b> to be transmitted via the clutch drum <b>7</b> and the drum hub <b>13</b>, to the drive sprocket <b>15</b> and the saw chain or to drive the belt pulley to a cut off saw. For the trimmer the clutch drum <b>13</b> drives the output shaft of the trimmer. A brake band <b>12</b> can be freely wound around the outer surface of the peripheral portion <b>8</b> so as to being able to stop the clutch drum <b>7</b>, and thereby also e.g. a saw chain, through friction, when actuated. Since the radius where the peripheral portion <b>8</b> meets the end portion <b>9</b> is made very small, almost the full width of the radially outer surface of the peripheral portion <b>8</b> can be used as contact surface for the brake band <b>12</b>. This allows the width of the peripheral portion <b>8</b> to be smaller compared to the conventional case, still sustaining braking efficiency. Reducing the width of the peripheral portion <b>8</b> and the thickness of the end portion <b>9</b> compared to a conventional clutch drum <b>7</b>, implies a decrease of weight of the clutch drum <b>7</b> and the centrifugal clutch <b>4</b>, which also enables a decrease of weight of the crank shaft <b>2</b> and possibly of the crank shaft bearings. This further enables a light weight and versatile hand-held power tool, being easy to operate.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a clutch drum <b>7</b>, a drum hub <b>13</b> and a drive sprocket <b>15</b> of a centrifugal clutch <b>4</b> according to a preferred embodiment of the invention. The clutch drum <b>7</b> is similar to the one described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and comprises an end portion <b>9</b> and a peripheral portion <b>8</b>. Additional operations, such as drawing or folding, have been applied to the sheet metal of the peripheral portion <b>8</b>, so as to form a peripheral portion <b>8</b> being composed of two layers, one radially outer layer and a second radially inner layer. The sheet metal of the clutch drum <b>7</b> has the thickness 1.0 mm, which implies that the peripheral portion <b>8</b> has the total thickness 2.0 mm and the end portion <b>9</b> has the thickness 1.0 mm. The thickness of the end portion <b>9</b> has proved to be sufficient although it is about half the thickness of a conventional end portion. The thickness of the end portion <b>9</b> can in fact be reduced by e.g. another 0.2 mm by machining, e.g. by turning in a lathe, still being sufficient. Since sheet metal of less thickness can be used with this embodiment, the cost of material can be reduced.</p>
