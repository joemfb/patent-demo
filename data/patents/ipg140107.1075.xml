<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the &#xa7;371 U.S. National Stage of International Application No. PCT/US2009/059513, filed 5 Oct. 2009, which claims the benefit of &#x201c;U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/103,059 filed 6 Oct. 2008, entitled ACTUATOR FOR SPRAY CONTAINER,&#x201d; both are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure herein relates generally to actuators for spray containers and methods of manufacturing actuators for spray containers.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Spray containers containing many different components or contents such as, e.g., paint, adhesives, corrosives, lubricants, insect repellents, hairsprays, creams, edibles, foams, etc. have been marketed for many household, commercial, and industrial purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In certain conventional spray containers, an actuator apparatus may include a tubular valve stem element biased into a closed position which, when depressed into the body of the container opens the valve and releases the contents which are held under pressure. When the applied force at the valve stem is removed, the valve stem returns to its closed position simultaneously stopping the outward flow of the pressurized contents of the container. For example, in one type of spray container, the actuator apparatus may include a button fitted directly over the valve stem such that when the button is depressed, the valve stem is simultaneously depressed or tilted against a spring bias causing the contents of the container to be released via an outlet. Release of the pressure at the button returns the valve stem to its equilibrium position. Often, a protective cover is fitted over the top of the spray container covering the actuator apparatus and is removed before use. Such protective covers may then be placed back over the actuator apparatus, e.g., for safe storage.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another type of spray container, an actuator apparatus may include a cap having a button or trigger. By depressing the button or trigger, the contents of the spray container may be sprayed, e.g., through an opening in the cap. Often, the button or trigger is not protected from accidental depression by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Lockable actuator apparatuses have been described. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,523,722 to Clark et al., U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2005/0017027 to Yerby et al., and U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2007/0039979 to Strand et al. disclose various lockable actuators for spray containers. However, such designs may include many separate components and/or may be too complex such that the components and/or complexity may increase manufacturing problems (e.g., complex multi-piece molds, etc.), which may increase the cost of such actuators.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The disclosure herein relates generally to actuators for spray containers and methods of manufacturing actuators for spray containers.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment of the actuator apparatus for a spray container, the actuator apparatus includes a base and a cover coupled to the base. The base includes a lower portion couplable to the spray container and a push button depressibly attached to the lower portion. The push button includes a body portion, an aperture portion, and a receiver stem for receiving a valve assembly. The body portion extends along an axis of the actuator apparatus between a first end region connectable to the lower portion of the base and a second end region to be contacted for depression of the push button by a user. The aperture portion extends radially from a region of the body portion and defines an exit aperture. The receiver stem portion defines an entrance aperture. A fluid passageway extends between the entrance aperture and the exit aperture. Further, the push button is movable relative to the lower portion of the base between at least a normal position and a depressed position. When the push button is in the depressed position, the push button actuates the valve assembly to provide a spray through the exit aperture. The cover defines a push button opening that permits access to the second end region of the body portion of the push button to allow depression of the push button by the user. Further, the cover and the base are movable relative to each other between at least a locked position such that the push button is restricted from moving into the depressed position and an unlocked position such that the push button is allowed to move into the depressed position. The cover further defines a spray opening alignable with the exit aperture of the aperture portion when the cover is in the unlocked position. Further, the cover includes a restraint structure and the restraint structure is located below the aperture portion of the push button of the base to restrict the push button from moving into the depressed position when the cover is in the locked position.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, the actuator apparatus for a spray container includes a base and a cover coupled to the base. The base includes a lower portion couplable to the spray container and a push button depressibly attached to the lower portion. The push button includes a body portion and an aperture portion. The body portion extends between a first end region connectable to the lower portion of the base and a second end region to be contacted for depression of the push button by a user. The aperture portion extends radially from a region of the body portion. Further, the push button is movable relative to the lower portion of the base by depression of the push button by the user. Still further, the aperture portion defines an exit aperture. The cover defines a push button opening that permits access to the second end region of the body portion to allow depression of the push button by the user. Also, the cover and the base are rotatably movable relative to each other between an unlocked position and a locked position. The cover includes a cylindrical inner wall portion lying parallel to an axis of the actuator apparatus and the cylindrical inner wall portion defines at least a portion of the push button opening. The cover further includes a restraint structure locatable below the aperture portion of the push button of the base to restrict the push button from depression by the user when in the locked position. Further, at least a portion of the restraint structure is located closer to the axis of the actuator apparatus than the cylindrical inner wall portion of the cover. Still further, the cover defines a spray opening alignable with the exit aperture by rotating the cover and the base relative to each other when in the unlocked position.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, a method of manufacturing a cover for an actuator apparatus having a base including a lower portion and a centrally-located push button depressibly attached to the lower portion is described. The method of manufacturing includes providing a mold defining a cavity for forming the cover. The cover defines a centrally-located push button opening that permits access to the push button of the base when assembled with the base. Further, the cover includes an inner wall portion, an outer wall portion, and a restraint structure extending from the inner wall portion. The inner wall portion lies along an axis of the actuator apparatus when assembled with the base and defines at least a portion of the push button opening. The outer wall portion is located at a distance further away from the axis than the inner wall portion when assembled with the base and defines a spray opening. The restraint structure extends from the inner wall portion and at least a portion of the restraint structure is located closer to the axis of the actuator apparatus when assembled than the inner wall portion of the cover. The mold includes a first mold portion and a second mold portion. The first mold portion defines a first molding surface corresponding to at least outer and inner wall portion surfaces of the cover facing a first direction and at least a lower surface of the restraint structure. The second mold portion defines a second molding surface corresponding to at least outer and inner wall portion surfaces of the cover facing a second direction opposite from the first direction and at least an upper surface of the restraint structure. The method further includes positioning the first mold portion relative to the second mold portion such that the first molding surface of the first mold portion and the second molding surface of the second mold portion define the cavity of the mold for forming the cover and introducing moldable material into the cavity of the mold. Still further, the method includes forming the cover from the moldable material within the cavity of the mold, moving the first mold portion relative to the second mold portion for removing the cover from the cavity of the mold, and removing the cover from the cavity of the mold.</p>

Advantages, together with a more complete understanding, will become apparent and appreciated by referring to the following detailed description and claims taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying figures of the drawing which form a part hereof, and in which are shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments which may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A spray container <b>5</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> extending from a bottom portion <b>6</b> to a top portion <b>7</b> along an axis <b>12</b>. An exemplary actuator apparatus <b>10</b> is coupled to the top portion <b>7</b> of the spray container <b>5</b>. The spray container <b>5</b> (e.g., a cylindrical spay can) may be any spray container containing a pressurized material that may be actuated by a user to release (e.g., spray) the pressurized contents from an opening. Further, the spray container <b>5</b> may contain many different liquid materials such as, e.g., paint, adhesives, corrosives, lubricants, insect repellents, hairsprays, creams, edibles, foams, tear gas, pepper spray, and/or any other contents as would be known by one having ordinary skill in the art. Also, the spray container <b>5</b> may be formed of any material capable of containing its contents under pressure, e.g., metals, polymers, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the spray container <b>5</b> includes a cylindrical can. Although the spray container <b>5</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> is cylindrical, the actuator apparatus may be operably coupled to a spray container having any shape and/or size, e.g., a square container.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Two or more components of the actuator apparatus <b>10</b> are movable relative to each other between two or more different positions. A locked position is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> while an unlocked position is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>. In the unlocked position, the actuator apparatus <b>10</b> may allow a user to release at least some of the pressurized contents contained in the spray container <b>5</b>. In the locked position, the actuator apparatus <b>10</b> may restrict (e.g., inhibit) a user from releasing the pressurized contents contained within the spray container <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">An exploded view of an exemplary embodiment of the actuator apparatus <b>10</b> arranged along an axis <b>12</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The actuator apparatus <b>10</b> may include a base <b>100</b>, a cover <b>200</b>, an insert <b>300</b>, and a valve assembly <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The valve assembly <b>400</b> may include an actuation valve <b>402</b>, a flanged cup portion <b>404</b>, and a tube portion <b>406</b>. When assembled with the spray container <b>5</b>, the flanged cup portion <b>404</b> may be coupled (e.g., crimped, press-fit, adhered, welded, etc.) to at least a portion of the top of the spray container <b>5</b>, the tube portion <b>406</b> may extend into the interior of the spray container <b>5</b>, and the actuation valve <b>402</b> may extend upward from the top of the spray container <b>5</b>. The actuation valve <b>402</b> and flanged cup portion <b>404</b> may further include various structures to operably couple the actuation valve <b>402</b> to a portion of the base such that any pressurized contents released through the actuation valve <b>402</b> flow into a portion of the base <b>100</b> (e.g., through passageway <b>174</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>). The flanged cup portion <b>404</b> may include a centrally-disposed circular stepped protrusion <b>408</b> upon which the actuation valve <b>402</b> extends. Such stepped protrusion <b>408</b> may include portions having different diameters that may improve the coupling between the valve assembly <b>400</b> and the base <b>100</b>. In at least one embodiment, the components of the valve assembly <b>400</b> may be formed of the same material. In other embodiments, the components of the valve assembly <b>400</b> may be separate components coupled together.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The actuation valve <b>402</b> may be movable to, e.g., release the pressurized contents of a spray container (e.g., spray container <b>5</b>). Such movement of the actuation valve <b>402</b> may be downward depression, axially movement, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">One having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other valve configurations may be utilized with the apparatus described herein. For example, any valve assembly operable by a push button as described herein to release contents of a spray container may be utilized in conjunction with the actuator apparatus <b>10</b> or variations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The base <b>100</b> may include a lower portion <b>120</b> and a push button <b>140</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-11</figref>). The push button <b>140</b> may be depressibly attached to the lower portion <b>120</b>. As used herein, &#x201c;depressibly attached&#x201d; may refer to attachment such that the push button <b>140</b> may be depressed under normal force by a user to move the push button <b>140</b> relative to the lower portion <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The lower portion <b>120</b> may include a first end region <b>121</b>A and a second end region <b>121</b>B located further away from the axis <b>12</b> than the first end region <b>121</b>A. The second end region <b>121</b>B may be the portion of the base <b>100</b> that is coupleable to the spray container <b>5</b> utilizing, e.g., one or more protrusions <b>122</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) that may facilitate a &#x201c;snap-fit&#x201d; to the top of the spray container <b>5</b>. Further, the lower portion <b>120</b> may define a push button aperture <b>124</b> located directly below the push button <b>140</b> to facilitate downward movement of the push button <b>140</b> (e.g., such that when the push button <b>140</b> is depressed, at least a portion of the push button <b>140</b> may be located within the push button aperture <b>124</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-11</figref>, the lower portion <b>120</b> may include a bridge portion <b>126</b> connecting the lower portion <b>120</b> and the push button <b>140</b>. The bridge portion <b>126</b> may be sized and formed of such resilient material that the push button <b>140</b> may be depressed to a depressed position (e.g., movement relative to the lower portion <b>120</b>) and returned to a normal position without detaching from the lower portion <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Further, the push button <b>140</b> may be biased into the normal position such that only depression by a user may actuate the valve assembly <b>400</b> to release at least some of the pressurized contents of the spray container <b>5</b>. The bridge portion <b>126</b> may provide such bias. In other embodiments, however, the push button <b>140</b> may include other componentry (e.g., springs), materials (e.g., memory foam), and/or structures that may bias the push button into the normal position.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The lower portion <b>120</b> may further include a first female locking structure <b>128</b>, a second female locking structure <b>130</b>, a spray opening shield portion <b>132</b>, and deflectable cover retention ribs <b>134</b> that will be described herein in relation to their functions relative to the push button <b>140</b> and cover <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The push button <b>140</b> may include a body portion <b>142</b>, an aperture portion <b>160</b>, and a receiver stem portion <b>170</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). Although depicted as being cylindrical, the push button <b>140</b> may be any shape and/or size operable to be depressed by a user to actuate a valve assembly, e.g., valve assembly <b>400</b>. The push button <b>140</b> may be movable relative to the lower portion <b>120</b> of the base <b>100</b> between at least a normal position and a depressed position. When the push button <b>140</b> is in the depressed position (which is only permitted when the actuator assembly is in the unlocked position), the push button <b>140</b> may actuate the actuation valve <b>402</b> of the valve assembly <b>400</b> thereby releasing at least some of the pressurized contents of the spray container <b>5</b> through, e.g., an exit aperture <b>162</b> of the aperture portion <b>160</b> of the push button <b>140</b> of the base <b>100</b>. When the push button <b>140</b> is in the normal position, the valve assembly <b>402</b> is not actuated and thereby no pressurized contents are released.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The body portion <b>142</b> of the push button <b>140</b> may extend along an axis <b>12</b> of the actuator apparatus <b>10</b> from a first end region <b>144</b> that is connectable to the lower portion <b>120</b> of the base <b>100</b>, e.g., via the bridge portion <b>126</b> of the lower portion <b>120</b> of the base <b>100</b>, to a second end region <b>146</b> that may be contacted (e.g., depressed by a finger) by a user. The second end region <b>146</b>, as depicted, may define a sloped, concave surface <b>148</b>, upon which further may be defined spray direction indicia <b>150</b> to, e.g., indicate the direction that the pressurized contents of the spray container may be released and/or whether the actuator apparatus <b>10</b> is in a locked or unlocked position. The sidewalls of the body <b>142</b> may cylindrical, e.g., as depicted, and further may be parallel to the axis <b>12</b> of the actuator apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The aperture portion <b>160</b> may extend radially (e.g., outwardly from the axis <b>12</b> of the actuator apparatus) from a region of the body portion <b>142</b> (e.g., the side wall thereof) and may define the exit aperture <b>162</b>. When the pressurized contents are released from the spray container <b>5</b>, the contents may be released (e.g., sprayed) through the exit aperture <b>162</b>. In the embodiment depicted, the aperture portion <b>160</b> includes an insert aperture <b>166</b> within which the insert <b>300</b> is located. The insert <b>300</b> may be a separately manufactured component from the base <b>100</b> or may be integral with the base <b>100</b>. For example, the insert <b>300</b> may be a molded feature of the aperture portion <b>160</b>. As described herein, the insert <b>300</b> may be a part of the aperture portion <b>160</b> of the push button <b>140</b> of the base <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Further, at least in one embodiment, the aperture portion <b>160</b> extends along a portion of the height of the push button body portion <b>142</b>. Also, the aperture portion <b>160</b> may have a lower surface <b>164</b> that be contacted by, e.g., a restraint structure (e.g., restraint structure <b>204</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-19</figref>) to restrict the downward movement of the push button <b>140</b> as described herein. Although aperture portion <b>160</b> is depicted as having a lower surface <b>164</b> that is flat, the aperture portion <b>160</b> may be any size and/or shape capable of being contacted by a corresponding restraint structure (e.g., by restraint structure <b>204</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-19</figref>) to restrict the movement of the push button <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Further, although in this embodiment, the aperture portion <b>160</b> is the portion of the push button <b>140</b> that may be contacted by a restraint structure (e.g., by restraint structure <b>204</b>) to restrict the movement of the push button <b>140</b>, the aperture portion may be separate from the portion the may be contacted to restrict movement of the push button. For example, in at least one embodiment, the aperture portion may not extend from the push button body portion and instead may be flush with the exterior of the push button body. In this embodiment, an additional structure may extend radially from the push button body portion to be contacted by a restraint structure to restrict the movement of the push button.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The receiver stem portion <b>170</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) may receive the valve assembly <b>400</b> and may define an entrance aperture <b>172</b>. A passageway <b>174</b> may be capable of transmitting gas and/or fluid and may extend from the entrance aperture <b>172</b> to the exit aperture <b>162</b> of the aperture portion <b>160</b>. When the actuation valve <b>402</b> is actuated, the pressurized contents of the spray container <b>5</b> may released and may flow through the valve assembly <b>400</b> into the entrance aperture <b>172</b>, through the passageway <b>174</b>, and exit through the exit aperture <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The base <b>100</b> may further include locked and unlocked indicia <b>102</b> located on various surfaces of its components to indicate to a user what state the actuator apparatus <b>10</b> is in (e.g., unlocked or locked positions). Although the indicia <b>102</b> are depictions of a &#x201c;locked padlock&#x201d; and an &#x201c;unlocked padlock,&#x201d; any indicia including graphics and/or text that may be capable of indicating to a user the state of the actuator apparatus may be included on the actuator apparatus. For example, the spray opening shield portion <b>132</b> may extend upwardly from the base <b>100</b> and may include such indicia <b>102</b>. In this embodiment, the spray opening shield portion <b>132</b> has indicia <b>102</b> indicating that the actuator apparatus <b>10</b> is in a locked state, which is only viewable to user when the actuator apparatus <b>10</b> is actually in a locked state or position as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In one or more alternate embodiments, the spray opening shield portion <b>132</b> may not be used. Rather, the locked indicia may be provided on the push button body portion <b>142</b> such that it shows through the opening <b>208</b> when the apparatus is in a locked position.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The cover <b>200</b>, or shroud, may be coupled to the base <b>100</b> and aligned along an axis <b>12</b> of the actuator apparatus <b>10</b>. The cover <b>200</b> may define a push button opening <b>202</b> (e.g., along axis <b>12</b>) that permits access to the second end region <b>146</b> of the push button <b>140</b> to allow depression (e.g., by a finger) of the push button <b>140</b> by a user when the base <b>100</b> and the cover <b>200</b> are assembled together (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, <b>25</b>, &#x26; <b>27</b>-<b>29</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The cover <b>200</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-20</figref>) may be coupled (e.g., rotatably coupled) to the base <b>100</b> to allow movement there between. At least in one embodiment, the cover <b>200</b> is rotatable relative to the base <b>100</b> between a locked position such that the push button <b>140</b> is restricted from moving into the depressed position and an unlocked position such that the push button <b>140</b> may be allowed to move into the depressed position. The cover <b>200</b> may include a restraint structure <b>204</b> that restricts the push button <b>140</b> from moving into the depressed position when the base <b>100</b> and/or cover <b>200</b> is in the locked position. Further, the restraint structure <b>204</b> may define an upper surface <b>206</b> and a lower surface <b>209</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). When the base <b>100</b> and/or cover <b>200</b> is in the locked position, the restraint structure <b>204</b> may be located below the aperture portion <b>160</b> of the push button <b>140</b> of the base <b>100</b> to physically restrict the aperture portion <b>160</b> from moving downwardly, which in turn restricts the other portions of the push button <b>140</b> from moving into the depressed position. In other words, the upper surface <b>206</b> of the restraint structure <b>204</b> may directly contact the lower surface <b>164</b> of the aperture portion <b>160</b> of the push button <b>140</b> of the base <b>100</b> to restrict the movement of the push button <b>140</b> into the depressed position.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In at least one embodiment, the cover <b>200</b> may include one or more restraint structures. However, as depicted, the cover <b>200</b> includes only one restraint structure <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The cover <b>200</b> may further define a spray opening <b>208</b> that may be alignable with the exit aperture <b>162</b> of the aperture portion <b>160</b> of the push button <b>140</b> of the base <b>100</b> when the cover <b>200</b> is in the unlocked position. The cover <b>200</b> may further include an inner wall portion <b>210</b> lying along the axis <b>12</b> of the actuator apparatus <b>10</b> and an outer wall portion <b>230</b> located further away from the axis <b>12</b> than the inner wall portion <b>210</b>. The inner wall portion <b>210</b> may further include inside surface <b>222</b> and an exterior surface <b>224</b>. The inner wall portion <b>210</b>, as depicted, may by cylindrical to, e.g., define at least a portion of the push button opening <b>202</b>. In other embodiments, however, the inner wall portion <b>210</b> may be any shape or size to accommodate and permit depressible movement of at least a portion of the push button <b>140</b>. Further, the restraint structure <b>204</b> may be located closer to the axis <b>12</b> of the actuator apparatus <b>10</b> than the inner wall portion <b>210</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The inner wall portion <b>210</b> of the cover <b>200</b> may further define a first stop surface <b>212</b> and a second stop surface <b>214</b>. The first stop surface <b>212</b> may be operable with the aperture portion <b>160</b> of the base <b>100</b> to stop the cover <b>200</b> and base <b>100</b> from moving (e.g., rotating about axis <b>12</b>) past the unlocked position. For example, a first side surface <b>165</b>A of the aperture portion <b>160</b> may contact the first stop surface <b>212</b> to stop the cover <b>200</b> from rotating relative to the base <b>100</b>. When the first side surface <b>165</b>A of the aperture portion <b>160</b> contacts the first stop surface <b>212</b>, the aperture apparatus <b>10</b> is in the unlocked position.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The second stop surface <b>214</b> may be operable with the aperture portion <b>160</b> of the base <b>100</b> to stop the cover <b>200</b> and base <b>100</b> from moving past the locked position. For example, a second side surface <b>165</b>B of the aperture portion <b>160</b> may contact the second stop surface <b>214</b> to stop the cover <b>200</b> from rotating relative to the base <b>100</b>. When the second side surface <b>165</b>B of the aperture portion <b>160</b> contacts the second stop surface <b>214</b>, the aperture apparatus <b>10</b> is in the locked position.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The outer wall portion <b>230</b> may further define interior surface <b>242</b> and exterior surface <b>244</b>. Further, the outer wall portion <b>230</b> may include a male locking structure <b>232</b> located on a portion of the interior surface <b>242</b> of the outer wall portion <b>230</b>. The male locking structure <b>232</b> may engage either of the first female locking structure <b>128</b> (when in the locked position) or the second female locking structure <b>130</b> (when in the unlocked position) of the base <b>100</b> when the base <b>100</b> and the cover <b>200</b> are assembled to form the actuator apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Each of the female locking structures <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> may include a first rib <b>129</b>A, <b>129</b>B and second rib <b>131</b>A, <b>131</b>B, respectively. Each rib <b>129</b>A, <b>129</b>B, <b>131</b>A, <b>131</b>B may extend outwardly from the lower portion <b>120</b> of the base <b>100</b> for engagement with the male locking structure <b>232</b> of the outer wall portion <b>230</b> of the cover <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The male locking structure <b>232</b> of the outer wall portion <b>230</b> of the cover <b>200</b> may include a deflectable portion <b>234</b> for deflectably engaging the first rib <b>129</b>A of the first female locking structure <b>128</b> of the lower portion <b>120</b> of the base <b>100</b> when the cover <b>200</b> is moving into the locked position (e.g., such as to make a &#x201c;click&#x201d; when moving into the locked position) and for deflectably engaging the first rib <b>129</b>B of the second female locking structure <b>130</b> of the lower portion <b>120</b> of the base <b>100</b> when the cover <b>200</b> is moving into the unlocked position (e.g., such as to make a &#x201c;click&#x201d; when moving into the unlocked position). The deflectable portion <b>234</b> may deflect to provide resistance to moving the cover <b>200</b> relative to the base <b>100</b> so as to signal or indicate to a user that the cover <b>200</b> may almost be moved (relative to the base <b>100</b>) into either a locked or unlocked position. The cover <b>200</b> may be moved relative to the base <b>100</b> until the deflectable portion <b>234</b> deflects over or past one of the first ribs <b>129</b>A, <b>129</b>B of the first and the second female locking structures <b>128</b>, <b>130</b>, which provides some restriction in moving the cover <b>200</b> relative to the base <b>100</b> in the opposite direction such that a user may not inadvertently lock or unlock the actuator apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The male locking structure <b>232</b> of the outer wall portion <b>230</b> of the cover may further include a rigid portion <b>236</b> for engaging the second rib <b>131</b>A of the first female locking structure <b>128</b> of the base <b>100</b> when the cover <b>200</b> is moved into the locked position to stop the cover <b>200</b> from moving (e.g., relative to the base <b>100</b>) past the locked position and for engaging the second rib <b>131</b>B of the second female locking structure <b>130</b> of the base <b>100</b> when the cover <b>200</b> is moved into the unlocked position to stop the cover from moving (e.g., relative to the base <b>100</b>) past the unlocked position. The rigid portion <b>236</b> may engage the second ribs <b>131</b>A, <b>131</b>B so as to stop the cover <b>200</b> from moving relative to the base <b>100</b> any farther. As a result, the male locking structure <b>232</b> may be sandwiched between either the first rib <b>129</b>A and the second rib <b>131</b>A of the first female locking structure <b>128</b> or the first rib <b>129</b>B and the second rib <b>131</b>B of the second female locking structure <b>130</b> to be partially restrained/inhibited such that a user may not inadvertently lock/unlock the actuator apparatus <b>100</b> or move (e.g., rotate) the cover <b>200</b> relative to the base <b>100</b> further past either the unlocked or locked positions.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The cover <b>200</b> may further include an annular flange <b>216</b> located on the interior surface of the outer wall portion <b>230</b> of the cover <b>200</b> extending inwardly towards the axis <b>12</b> of the actuator apparatus <b>10</b> for use in coupling the cover <b>200</b> to the base <b>100</b> utilizing, e.g., the deflectable cover retention ribs <b>134</b> of the lower portion <b>120</b> of the base <b>100</b>. The annular flange <b>216</b> may include an upper surface <b>218</b> (e.g., facing upwardly) and a lower surface <b>220</b> (e.g., facing downwardly), and each deflectable cover retention rib <b>134</b> may include an outer surface <b>136</b> (e.g., facing away from axis <b>12</b>) and a bottom surface <b>138</b> (e.g., a surface orthogonal to axis <b>12</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The base <b>100</b> and the cover <b>200</b> may be coupled together by aligning the base <b>100</b> and the cover <b>200</b> along an axis <b>12</b> with the cover <b>200</b> positioned above the base <b>100</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The base <b>100</b> and cover <b>200</b> may be moved towards each such that the push button <b>140</b> of the base <b>100</b> extends at least partially into the push button aperture <b>124</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30A</figref>). Further, the base <b>100</b> and the cover <b>200</b> are movable relative to each other between at least a pre-coupled position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30B</figref>), where the cover <b>200</b> not yet coupled to the base <b>100</b> but in contact thereof, and a coupled position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30C</figref>), where the cover <b>200</b> is coupled to the base <b>100</b>. When in the pre-coupled position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30B</figref>), the lower surface <b>220</b> of the annular flange <b>216</b> of the cover <b>200</b> may contact the outer surface <b>136</b> of the deflectable cover retention rib <b>134</b> to deflect the deflectable cover retention rib <b>134</b> away from its normal position. When in the coupled position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30C</figref>), the cover <b>200</b> is &#x201c;snapped&#x201d; past the pre-coupled position. In the coupled position, the upper surface <b>218</b> of the annular flange <b>216</b> of the cover <b>200</b> may engage the bottom surface <b>138</b> of the deflectable cover retention rib <b>134</b> to retain the cover <b>200</b> to the base <b>100</b>. An annular gap <b>139</b> may further be defined between the bottom surface <b>138</b> of the cover retention rib <b>134</b> and the lower portion <b>120</b> of the base <b>100</b>.

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The cover <b>200</b> and base <b>100</b> may be in the form of one or more alternate configurations to accomplish the coupling therebetween. For example, the annular flange of the cover may project outward and away from axis <b>12</b> as opposed to inward and an annular retention rib of the base may extend inward towards axis <b>12</b> (e.g., at the top of the lower portion <b>120</b> of base <b>100</b>) to engage the annular flange of the cover thereunder when snapped into place. One will recognize that such snap coupling may be implemented by a variety of base and cover mating configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Further, although the upper surface <b>218</b> and the lower surface <b>220</b> of the annular flange <b>216</b> converge at a point creating an edge as depicted, the upper surface <b>218</b> and the lower surface <b>220</b> may converge in a rounded or less-steep angle such that the annular flange <b>216</b> has a rounded surface facing the axis <b>12</b> of the actuator apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As described herein, the base <b>100</b> and the cover <b>200</b> may be movable (e.g., rotatably movable) relative to each between the locked and unlocked positions.

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The method <b>600</b> may include providing a mold (block <b>602</b>). The mold may define a cavity for forming the cover. In at least this embodiment, the cover may be similar to the cover <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-20</figref>. For example, the cover may define a centrally-located push button opening that permits access to the push button of the base when assembled with the base. Further, the cover may include an inner wall portion lying along an axis of the actuator apparatus when assembled with the base. The inner wall portion of the cover may define at least a portion of the push button opening and an outer wall portion may be located a distance further away from the axis than the inner wall portion when assembled with the base. Further, the outer wall portion of the cover may define a spray opening. The restraint structure may extend from the inner wall portion and at least a portion of that restraint structure may be located closer to the axis of the actuator apparatus when assembled than the inner wall portion of the cover.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Providing a mold (block <b>602</b>) may include providing a first mold portion (block <b>604</b>) and providing a second mold portion (block <b>606</b>).
