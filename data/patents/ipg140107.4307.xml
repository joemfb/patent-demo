<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present embodiments relate to electronic fuse (efuse) programming under low voltage power supply and process limitations for an integrated circuit in either wafer or packaged form.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, there is a current-voltage diagram of a semiconductor controlled rectifier (SCR) of the prior art. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a simplified diagram of the SCR showing the PNPN impurity layers and intervening junctions J<b>1</b>-J<b>3</b>. Here and in the following discussion it should be understood that a semiconductor controlled rectifier may also be called a silicon controlled rectifier or a thyristor as described by S. M. Sze, &#x201c;Semiconductor Devices Physics and Technology&#x201d; 148-156 (John Wiley &#x26; Sons 1985). In general, a silicon controlled rectifier is a special case of a semiconductor controlled rectifier that is specifically formed on a silicon substrate. The current-voltage diagram shows a reverse blocking region <b>100</b> where junctions J<b>1</b> and J<b>3</b> are reverse biased, but junction J<b>2</b> is forward biased. By way of contrast, junctions J<b>1</b> and J<b>3</b> are forward biased, but junction J<b>2</b> is reverse biased in the forward blocking region <b>102</b>. At switching voltage Vsw <b>104</b>, the SCR switches from the forward blocking region to a holding voltage (Vh) and holding current (Ih) region <b>106</b>. In this mode all three junctions J<b>1</b>-J<b>3</b> are forward biased and the minimum holding voltage across the SCR may be as low as a single diode drop or approximately 0.7 V. In holding region <b>106</b>, therefore, the SCR functions as a near ideal switch with very little power dissipation due to the low holding voltage and holding current.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The preferred embodiments of the present invention provide significant advantages of programming electronic fuses in integrated circuits operating at low supply voltages as will become evident from the following detailed description.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, there is a fuse programming circuit of the present invention. The circuit includes a fuse <b>220</b>, an SCR <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, and a switching circuit <b>200</b>-<b>210</b>. The switching circuit includes n-channel input transistors <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> as well as cross-coupled p-channel transistors <b>200</b> and <b>202</b>. The fuse may be constructed of various materials that are well known in the art. In operation, a power supply voltage Vf is applied to fuse <b>220</b> and to the switching circuit. Prior to programming, fuse <b>220</b> has a low resistance value of preferably less than 100&#x3a9;. In this state, complementary programming signals /P(i) and P(i) are high and low, respectively, and the (i) subscript signifies decoded programming signals for the ith fuse. Thus, n-channel transistor <b>208</b> and p-channel transistor <b>202</b> are both on. Correspondingly, n-channel transistor <b>210</b> and p-channel transistor <b>200</b> are both off. The voltage on output lead <b>212</b>, therefore, is approximately equal to power supply voltage Vf and to the voltage at emitter terminal <b>214</b> of PNP transistor <b>222</b>. Thus, the voltage across the base-emitter junction of PNP transistor <b>222</b> is approximately zero and PNP transistor <b>222</b> remains off. In the off state, there is no collector current from PNP transistor <b>222</b>, so the base terminal <b>216</b> of NPN transistor <b>224</b> is held to ground or Vss by parasitic resistor <b>226</b>. Emitter terminal <b>218</b> of NPN transistor <b>224</b> is also biased to ground or Vss, so the base-emitter junction of NPN transistor <b>224</b> is approximately zero and NPN transistor <b>224</b> is also off.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In order to program fuse <b>220</b>, complementary programming signals /P(i) and P(i) are switched to low and high, respectively. Thus, n-channel transistor <b>208</b> and p-channel transistor <b>202</b> are both off. Correspondingly, n-channel transistor <b>210</b> and p-channel transistor <b>200</b> are both on. The voltage on output lead <b>212</b>, therefore, goes low to forward bias the base-emitter junction of PNP transistor <b>222</b>. Thus, PNP transistor <b>222</b> produces collector current which is divided between the base of NPN transistor <b>224</b> and parasitic resistor <b>226</b>. When the collector current is sufficient to forward bias the base-emitter junction of NPN transistor <b>224</b>, the SCR switches to holding mode <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). In the holding mode a voltage of approximately Vf &#x2212;0.7 V appears across fuse <b>220</b>. When power density is sufficient, fuse <b>220</b> is blown. Typical programming current for a fuse such as platinum silicide, polycrystalline silicon, or other suitable material may be 10-15 mA. Once the fuse is subjected to a sufficient programming pulse duration, complementary programming signals /P(i) and P(i) are switched back to high and low, respectively. This transition turns on p-channel transistor <b>202</b> and returns lead <b>212</b> to programming voltage Vf. A fuse read line (not shown) connected to emitter <b>214</b> is then compared to a reference voltage to assure that fuse <b>220</b> is blown. If the fuse resistance is not sufficiently high, the foregoing process is repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">There are several advantages to programming fuse <b>220</b> with an SCR. First, the SCR maintains a very low on resistance in a holding mode so that most of the power dissipation is in the fuse rather than in the programming circuitry. Second, programming current for the SCR passes through PNP transistor <b>222</b> and NPN transistor <b>224</b>. There are no thin oxide transistors in the programming current path that might be damaged by programming current or voltage. Third, due to the highly conductive state of the SCR in a holding mode, even a 1 &#x3bc;m wide SCR may easily sink 30 mA of programming current with little power dissipation. Fourth, unselected fuse programming circuits connected to the same Vf supply voltage have approximately 0 V across their respective PNP base-emitter junctions without regard to their fuse state. There is no appreciable gate oxide stress in the switching circuits of unselected programming circuits. Fourth, substantially all fuse programming current passes through the SCR rather than the switching circuit. Thus, p-channel and n-channel switching circuit transistors may be near minimum size. Finally, for advanced technologies where programming supply voltage Vf may be too great for p-channel of n-channel gate oxide, a voltage divider circuit such as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> may be used. The switching circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is the same as the switching circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> except that n-channel transistors <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> are configured as diodes and placed in series with re-channel transistors <b>208</b> and <b>210</b>, respectively. In this case, the maximum voltage across any gate oxide is reduced by an n-channel threshold voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is an exemplary array of 8 fuse programming circuits <b>300</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. The dotted infill region <b>310</b> is an isolation region such as shallow trench isolation (STI). Each fuse programming circuit includes a fuse <b>220</b>, and SCR <b>302</b>, and a switching circuit <b>304</b> as previously discussed. Power supply leads Vf, Vsa, Vsb, and Vss run horizontally through the array. Decoded programming signals such as /P(i) and P(i) and fuse read lines run vertically through the array. The Vss lead is connected to the sources of n-channel transistors <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> of each fuse circuit. Ground leads Vsa and Vsb are preferably connected to alternate programming circuits to provide additional isolation. For example, if an emitter of one of NPN transistors <b>224</b> is connected to ground lead Vsa, then emitters of adjacent NPN transistors <b>224</b> are connected to ground lead Vsb. Thus, any noise imparted to ground lead Vsa during programming is less likely to disturb adjacent fuse programming circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is a cross sectional view of SCR <b>302</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) along line A-A&#x2032;. Here, the width of the SCR is in a direction into the page. The plus sign (+) in the following discussion indicates a heavily doped semiconductor region having a concentration of at least 1e18 Atoms/cm^3. Alternatively, the minus sign (&#x2212;) indicates a lightly doped semiconductor region having a concentration of less than 1e18 Atoms/cm^3. The N+ region connected to terminal <b>212</b> provides a bias to the N&#x2212; well region to selectively activate or trigger the SCR. The P+ region connected to terminal <b>214</b> is the emitter of PNP transistor <b>222</b> as well as the anode of SCR <b>302</b>. The P+ region is formed in an N&#x2212; well that is the base of PNP transistor <b>222</b>. The N&#x2212; well is both the collector of NPN transistor <b>224</b> as well as the base of PNP transistor <b>222</b>. The P&#x2212; substrate <b>216</b> is both the collector of PNP transistor <b>222</b> as well as the base of NPN transistor <b>224</b>. N+ region <b>218</b> is the emitter of NPN transistor <b>224</b>. Both the N+ region <b>218</b> and adjacent P+ region are coupled to receive reference supply voltage Vsb. Parasitic resistor <b>226</b> forms a shunt between supply voltage terminal Vsb and the effective base region of NPN transistor <b>224</b> and affects the holding voltage of SCR <b>302</b>. For example, a small value of resistor <b>226</b> produces a high holding voltage Vh. Likewise, a greater value of resistor <b>226</b> produces a relatively lower holding voltage Vh.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is another embodiment of a fuse programming circuit of the present invention. This embodiment is similar to the previously discussed embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> except that parasitic resistor <b>226</b> may be excluded in a triple well process. The triple well process provides an advantage in isolating adjacent programming circuits <b>602</b> and <b>604</b>. As shown in fuse array <b>600</b> at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there is no need to include separate reference supply terminals. Thus, reference supply terminals Vsa and Vsb (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) are replaced with a single reference supply terminal Vs, which is connected to the cathode of SCR <b>602</b> or the emitter of NPN transistor <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, there is a cross sectional view of SCR <b>602</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) along line B-B&#x2032;. This is similar to the previously discussed SCR of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, except that the N&#x2212; region is extended to completely enclose P&#x2212; region <b>216</b> below the semiconductor surface. In this arrangement, the base of NPN transistor <b>224</b> is said to be floating or junction isolated. However, NPN transistor remains off, since there is no base current until PNP transistor <b>222</b> produces collector current as previously discussed. The absence of parasitic resistor <b>226</b> advantageously reduces the holding voltage Vh and the on resistance of SCR <b>602</b>. Thus, more power dissipation during fuse programming occurs in the fuse itself rather than in the SCR <b>602</b> or in the switching circuit <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, there is a boost circuit that may be used to generate power supply voltage Vf. This circuit provides a significant advantage in fuse programming when an external terminal for Vf is not available. This condition may occur in a packaged integrated circuit where an external terminal would require an additional package connector. Moreover, integrated circuit internal regulated voltage supplies may have insufficient voltage or current to program a fuse. The boost circuit includes p-channel transistor <b>802</b> having a source and bulk terminal connected to power supply terminal Vdd. P-channel transistor <b>804</b> has a source connected to the drain of p-channel transistor <b>802</b>. The drain and bulk terminal of p-channel transistor <b>804</b> are connected to fuse power supply terminal Vf. P-channel transistor <b>806</b> and n-channel transistor <b>808</b> form an inverter having an output terminal connected to the gate of p-channel transistor <b>804</b>. The source and bulk terminal of p-channel transistor <b>806</b> are connected to the source of p-channel transistor <b>804</b> and to fuse power supply terminal Vf. A boost capacitor Cp has one terminal connected to fuse power supply terminal Vf and another terminal coupled to receive control signal P*. Inverter <b>800</b> has an output terminal connected to the gate of p-channel transistor <b>802</b> and an input terminal coupled to receive complementary control signal /P*, which is also applied to the gates of p-channel transistor <b>806</b> and n-channel transistor <b>808</b>. Control signal P* and complementary control signal /P* are global programming signals that operate in synchronization with programming signals P(i) and /P(i). In other words, when any of programming signals P(i) and /P(i) change state, global programming signals P* and /P* also change state.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, operation of the boost circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> will be explained in detail. Global programming signals P* and /P* are initially low and high, respectively. The high level of /P* produces a low output from inverter <b>800</b> to turn on p-channel transistor <b>802</b>. Likewise, the high level of /P* produces a low output from the inverter formed by p-channel transistor <b>806</b> and n-channel transistor <b>808</b> to turn on p-channel transistor <b>804</b>. P-channel transistor <b>806</b> and n-channel transistor <b>808</b> remain off and on, respectively. In this state, fuse power supply voltage terminal Vf and capacitor Cp <b>810</b> are precharged to power supply voltage Vdd. When a fuse is to be programmed, /P* goes low <b>902</b>. The low level of /P* produces a high level output from inverter <b>800</b> to turn off p-channel transistor <b>802</b>. The low level of /P* also produces a high level output from the inverter formed by p-channel transistor <b>806</b> and n-channel transistor <b>808</b> to turn off p-channel transistor <b>804</b>. In this state, p-channel transistor <b>806</b> and n-channel transistor <b>808</b> remain on and off, respectively, and the precharge level is maintained at fuse power supply terminal Vf and across boost capacitor Cp <b>810</b>. P* then goes high <b>904</b> to boost fuse power supply voltage Vf to a desired level <b>900</b> for programming a selected fuse. The boosted voltage level <b>900</b> depends on the ratio of sizes of capacitor Cp and the parasitic capacitance of fuse voltage supply terminal Vf. For example, if the ratio of Cp to parasitic capacitance of fuse power supply terminal Vf is 4, the boosted voltage level is 1.8 Vdd. As previously discussed, the bulk terminals of p-channel transistors <b>804</b> and <b>806</b> are both connected to fuse power supply terminal Vf to prevent forward bias of their corresponding parasitic PNP transistors. After fuse power supply voltage Vf is boosted, programming signals P(i) and /P(i) go high and low, respectively, to activate an SCR corresponding to the fuse to be programmed. The activated SCR discharges capacitor Cp <b>810</b> at time <b>906</b> through fuse <b>220</b> to program the fuse as previously discussed. The boost circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> advantageously produces a sufficiently high and controlled voltage to program fuses when an external voltage is not available. Programming voltage and current is determined by the size of capacitor Cp. No thin oxide transistors in the selected or unselected switching circuits receive a voltage across gate oxide that is greater than supply voltage Vdd.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, there is a one bit fuse programming circuit of another embodiment of the present invention. Although the fuse programming circuit is specifically directed to fuse programming, one of ordinary skill in the art having access to the instant specification will understand the present invention is also applicable to antifuses. The circuit includes fuse <b>220</b>, SCR <b>256</b>, fuse latch circuit <b>258</b>-<b>264</b>, and a trigger transistor <b>266</b>. Fuse latch circuit <b>258</b>-<b>264</b> includes p-channel transistors <b>258</b>-<b>260</b> and n-channel transistors <b>262</b>-<b>264</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> is a simplified layout of the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>. Control gates of the transistors are indicated by dotted infill. Here and in the following discussion the same reference numerals are used to indicate the same elements.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Prior to programming, fuse <b>220</b> is electrically conductive having a resistance of preferably less than 100 ohms. In this state, fuse voltage Vf(0) goes high during power up after programming voltage Vp is high. Fuse address signal FA(0) is low so that n-channel transistor <b>266</b> is off. Parasitic resistor <b>252</b> holds the bulk terminal of p-channel transistors <b>258</b>-<b>260</b> at programming voltage Vp. The fuse latch <b>258</b>-<b>264</b> is set so that p-channel transistor <b>260</b> and n-channel transistor <b>262</b> are both off. Correspondingly, p-channel transistor <b>258</b> and n-channel transistor <b>264</b> are both on. Thus, fuse output signal FO(0,0) is low, indicating fuse <b>220</b> has not been programmed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, the structure of SCR <b>256</b> will be explained in detail. SCR <b>256</b> is incorporated in the design of fuse latch circuit <b>258</b>-<b>264</b> so that no additional layout area is required. SCR <b>256</b> includes both PNP and NPN bipolar transistors as shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. The P+ source of p-channel transistor <b>258</b> is the anode of SCR <b>256</b> and together with n-well <b>254</b> and P&#x2212; substrate they form the emitter, base, and collector, respectively, of the PNP bipolar transistor. The n-well <b>254</b>, P&#x2212; substrate, and source of re-channel transistor <b>262</b> form the collector, base, and emitter, respectively, of the NPN bipolar transistor. There are several features of the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10B</figref> that provide significant advantages over fuse programming circuits of the prior art. First, the SCR <b>256</b> is incorporated in the fuse latch circuit <b>258</b>-<b>264</b> so that no additional layout area is required. Second, the sources of p-channel transistor <b>258</b> and n-channel transistor <b>262</b> are closely spaced without other intervening heavily doped semiconductor regions to provide a minimum holding voltage when SCR <b>256</b> is latched. This is important for low voltage operation. Third, the width direction of p-channel transistor <b>258</b> and n-channel transistor <b>262</b> are parallel and closely spaced to provide maximum width with minimum power dissipation and heat generation in a latched state. Fourth, the transistors of the fuse latch circuit are shown with a width-to-length (W/L) ratio of greater than one so than intervening buffer stages for fuse output signal FO(0,0) may not be required. However, with a width of less than 1 &#x3bc;m, SCR <b>256</b> will sink a current of 30 mA for typical complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) processes. Fifth, n-well contacts such as n-well contact <b>1000</b> are advantageously positioned adjacent the drain side of p-channel transistors <b>258</b>-<b>260</b> and opposite their sources. This increases the n-well resistance of parasitic resistor <b>252</b> by increasing the distance to the N+/P&#x2212; junction J<b>2</b> as well as reducing the n-well cross-sectional area for conduction due to the depletion width of P+/N&#x2212; depletion region. Finally, the increased value of resistor <b>252</b> decreases the shunt resistance across the base-emitter junction of the PNP bipolar transistor and reduces trigger current required by n-channel trigger transistor <b>266</b>. Thus, only a minimum size n-channel trigger transistor <b>266</b> is necessary and the holding voltage of SCR <b>256</b> is further reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, there is a schematic diagram of an array of fuse programming circuits as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10B</figref>. Each fuse programming circuit, such as fuse programming circuit <b>1100</b>, is the same as described at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10B</figref>. The array of fuses is organized in rows and columns. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, there are m+1 rows and n+1 columns, where m and n are both positive integers. Each row of fuse programming circuits may correspond to a redundant row decoder, a redundant column decoder, or other desired circuit operations to be modified by fuse programming. Each row of fuse programming circuits produces n+1 fuse output signals. For example, the first row produces fuse output signals FO(0,0:n).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The timing diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> will be used to explain operation of the array of fuse programming circuits of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Initially the programming voltage Vp and the fuse voltage Vf(0:m) are both at power supply voltage Vdd. By way of example, the following explanation will apply specifically to fuse programming circuit <b>1100</b>, although the entire row B(0,0) through B(0,n) might be programmed at one time. At time <b>1200</b>, fuse voltage Vf(0:m) goes low. This grounds the source of p-channel transistor <b>260</b> and the source of n-channel transistor <b>266</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>). At time <b>1202</b>, a program address is applied to address bus A(0:n). If the fuse <b>220</b> of fuse programming circuit <b>1100</b> is to be programmed, address A(0:0) will be high. The address for any fuse programming circuit in row 0 that is not to be programmed will remain low. At time <b>1204</b>, programming signal PRG goes high and applies a high level fuse address FA(0:0) to fuse programming circuit <b>1100</b>. The high level of FA(0:0) turns on n-channel trigger transistor <b>266</b> and pulls n-well <b>254</b> low to provide base current to the PNP transistor of SCR <b>256</b>. Responsively, SCR <b>256</b> latches and drives the anode of SCR <b>256</b> to holding voltage <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). Programming voltage Vp is at a high level of power supply voltage Vdd, so SCR <b>256</b> latches to conduct sufficient current to blow fuse <b>220</b>. After fuse <b>220</b> is blown, address A(0:0) and programming signal PRG go low. Responsively, fuse address FA(0:0) goes low and turns off n-channel trigger transistor <b>256</b>. At time <b>1218</b>, fuse voltage Vf(0:0) returns high to set the fuse latch <b>258</b>-<b>264</b>. This produces a valid high fuse output signal FO(0:0) at time <b>1220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">There are several advantages to this programming method. First, it is possible to program single or multiple fuse programming circuits on row 0 by selectively applying a high level signal on address bus A(0:n). This is easily accomplished in a design-for-test (DFT) mode as is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Second, each row 0-m may be individually programmed as necessary without affecting previously programmed rows. Moreover, multiple fuse arrays as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> may be separately programmed without affecting previously programmed fuse arrays. Third, although programming voltage Vp is always high, the off state of p-channel transistor <b>258</b> when latched prevents current flow through a partially blown or high resistance fuse <b>220</b> during normal circuit operation. The fuse latch circuit <b>258</b>-<b>264</b>, therefore, is correctly set for a wide range of programmed resistance values of fuse <b>220</b>. Fourth, all transistors of the fuse programming circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> may be near minimum design size. Thus, required layout is greatly reduced over methods of the prior art. Additionally, SCR <b>256</b> is integrated into fuse latch <b>258</b>-<b>264</b> to further reduce required layout area. It is desirable, however, to assure that current density through the metal-to-silicon contacts of SCR <b>256</b> remains below 1e7 A/cm^2. Finally, the low holding voltage of SCR <b>256</b> greatly reduces power dissipation and heat generation during programming as compared to other methods of the prior art. Thus, reliability is greatly improved.</p>

Other combinations will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art having access to the instant specification.</p>
