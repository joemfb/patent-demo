<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates an organic light-emitting panel, a manufacturing method thereof, and an organic display device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, progress has been made in the research and development of display devices that use the phenomenon of electroluminescence occurring in organic material. Each light-emitting cell of such a display device is composed of an anode and a cathode with an organic light-emitting layer therebetween. When the display device is driven, holes are injected through the anode, electrons are injected through the cathode, and the holes and electrons recombine within the organic light-emitting layer, thereby emitting the light.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Banks composed of insulating material partition the organic light-emitting layer into light-emitting cells. The organic light-emitting layer is formed by dripping ink, which includes an organic light-emitting material, into each region separated by the banks and drying the ink.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, a problem with the organic light-emitting layer formed in this way is that it is difficult for the layer to have a uniform film thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As one example of technologies for evening out the film thickness of the organic light-emitting layer, Patent Literature 1 discloses providing a convexity on the inner sidewall of the bank in order to control the pinning location of the ink. In other words, according to the technology of Patent Literature 1, the pinning location of the ink dripped in one light-emitting cell can be set to the convexity. With this technology, it is possible to secure a uniform film thickness to a certain degree.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is considered difficult, however, to use the technology of Patent Literature 1 to detect in advance how the organic light-emitting layer of a display device is uneven in film thickness and, based on the detection results, form a minute convexity for each region or each inner sidewall of the bank to a high degree of precision. Therefore, it is not easy to maintain the organic light-emitting layer at a uniform film thickness over the entire region of the organic light-emitting panel.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an object of the present invention to solve the above problems by providing a display device, and a manufacturing method thereof, that has a uniform film thickness in the organic light-emitting layer across the entire panel and has an even luminance within the panel.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to solve the above problems, an organic light-emitting panel according to an aspect of the present invention has the following structure.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The organic light-emitting panel according to an aspect of the present invention comprises: an array of a plurality of pixels; one or more non-light-emitting cells each being provided between a different pair of adjacent pixels; a plurality of light-emitting cells provided in such a manner that each pixel includes at least three light-emitting cells that are arranged in an alignment and emit light of different colors, the at least three light-emitting cells including a first light-emitting cell located at an end of the alignment, a second light-emitting cell located at a central portion of the alignment, and a third light-emitting cell located at another end of the alignment; an underlying layer formed below the array of the plurality of pixels; a plurality of first electrodes each included in the underlying layer and placed below a different one of the plurality of light-emitting cells; a plurality of organic light-emitting layers each formed in a different one of the plurality of light-emitting cells by applying, for each pixel, at least three types of ink, that contain different organic light-emitting materials corresponding one-to-one to the different colors of light, respectively to the at least three light-emitting cells substantially at a same time; and a second electrode formed to be away from the underlying layer with each organic light-emitting layer therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The above organic light-emitting panel further comprises a plurality of banks formed above the underlying layer, separating the light-emitting cells, and defining each light-emitting cell, each of the plurality of pixels being structured such that among inner sidewalls facing each other in respective adjacent banks defining the first light-emitting cell and the third light-emitting cell, sidewalls adjacent to non-light-emitting cells have larger inclination angles than sidewalls adjacent to the second light-emitting cell, and inner sidewalls facing each other in two adjacent banks defining the second light-emitting cell have substantially equal inclination angles.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the above organic light-emitting panel according to an aspect of the present invention, for each pixel, three types of ink respectively corresponding to the first, second and third light-emitting cells are applied substantially at the same time, and thereby the organic light-emitting cells are formed. In this case, with regard to the second light-emitting cell whose two ends have the same ink vapor concentration, since the ink is applied at the same time to the first and third light-emitting cells that are adjacent to the second light-emitting cell, the organic light-emitting layer in the second light-emitting cell is not likely to become uneven in film thickness. Accordingly, with the above structure where inner sidewalls facing each other in two adjacent banks defining the second light-emitting cell have substantially equal inclination angles, it is possible to prevent the organic light-emitting layer from becoming uneven in film thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">On the other hand, with regard to the first light-emitting cell, ink is applied to the second light-emitting cell adjacent to the first light-emitting cell, but not to a non-light-emitting cell adjacent to the first light-emitting cell. Thus an end of the first light-emitting cell on the second light-emitting cell side has a higher ink vapor concentration than the opposite end thereof. Thus the film thickness of the light-emitting layer tends to be larger at an end on the non-light-emitting cell side than at the end on the second light-emitting cell side. Accordingly, the light-emitting layer therein is likely to become uneven in film thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, in the above organic light-emitting panel according to an aspect of the present invention, among inner sidewalls facing each other in two adjacent banks defining the first light-emitting cell, a sidewall adjacent to a non-light-emitting cell has a larger inclination angle than a sidewall adjacent to the second light-emitting cell. With this structure, the pinning location of the ink in the sidewall on the non-light-emitting cell side is relatively higher than the pinning location of the ink in the sidewall on the second light-emitting cell side. This enables the film thickness of the organic light-emitting layer in the first light-emitting cell on the non-light-emitting cell side to be decreased. As a result, it is possible to prevent the organic light-emitting layer in the first light-emitting cell from becoming uneven in film thickness between two ends thereof (an end on the non-light-emitting cell side and an end on the second light-emitting cell side).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, similarly to the above relationship between opposite sidewalls of two adjacent banks defining the first light-emitting cell, among inner sidewalls facing each other in two adjacent banks defining the third light-emitting cell, a sidewall adjacent to a non-light-emitting cell has a larger inclination angle than a sidewall adjacent to the second light-emitting cell. With this structure, the pinning location of the ink in the sidewall on the non-light-emitting cell side is relatively higher than the pinning location of the ink in the sidewall on the second light-emitting cell side. This enables the film thickness of the organic light-emitting layer in the first light-emitting cell on the non-light-emitting cell side to be decreased. As a result, it is possible to prevent the organic light-emitting layer in the third light-emitting cell from becoming uneven in film thickness between two ends thereof (an end on the non-light-emitting cell side and an end on the second light-emitting cell side).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As described above, in the above organic light-emitting panel according to an aspect of the present invention, it is possible to prevent the organic light-emitting layer in each light-emitting cell from becoming uneven in film thickness between two opposite ends thereof, providing excellent light-emitting characteristics in the same pixel.</p>

<p id="h-0011" num="0000">[Outline of Aspects of Present Invention]</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The organic light-emitting panel according to an aspect of the present invention comprises: an array of a plurality of pixels; one or more non-light-emitting cells each being provided between a different pair of adjacent pixels; a plurality of light-emitting cells provided in such a manner that each pixel includes at least three light-emitting cells that are arranged in an alignment and emit light of different colors, the at least three light-emitting cells including a first light-emitting cell located at an end of the alignment, a second light-emitting cell located at a central portion of the alignment, and a third light-emitting cell located at another end of the alignment; an underlying layer formed below the array of the plurality of pixels; a plurality of first electrodes each included in the underlying layer and placed below a different one of the plurality of light-emitting cells; a plurality of organic light-emitting layers each formed in a different one of the plurality of light-emitting cells by applying, for each pixel, at least three types of ink, that contain different organic light-emitting materials corresponding one-to-one to the different colors of light, respectively to the at least three light-emitting cells substantially at a same time; and a second electrode formed to be away from the underlying layer with each organic light-emitting layer therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The above organic light-emitting panel further comprises a plurality of banks formed above the underlying layer, separating the light-emitting cells, and defining each light-emitting cell, each of the plurality of pixels being structured such that among inner sidewalls facing each other in respective adjacent banks defining the first light-emitting cell and the third light-emitting cell, sidewalls adjacent to non-light-emitting cells have larger inclination angles than sidewalls adjacent to the second light-emitting cell, and inner sidewalls facing each other in two adjacent banks defining the second light-emitting cell have substantially equal inclination angles.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the above organic light-emitting panel according to an aspect of the present invention, for each pixel, three types of ink respectively corresponding to the first, second and third light-emitting cells are applied substantially at the same time, and thereby the organic light-emitting cells are formed. In this case, with regard to the second light-emitting cell whose two ends have the same ink vapor concentration, since the ink is applied at the same time to the first and third light-emitting cells that are adjacent to the second light-emitting cell, the organic light-emitting layer in the second light-emitting cell is not likely to become uneven in film thickness. Accordingly, with the above structure where inner sidewalls facing each other in two adjacent banks defining the second light-emitting cell have substantially equal inclination angles, it is possible to prevent the organic light-emitting layer from becoming uneven in film thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">On the other hand, with regard to the first light-emitting cell, ink is applied to the second light-emitting cell adjacent to the first light-emitting cell, but not to a non-light-emitting cell adjacent to the first light-emitting cell. Thus an end of the first light-emitting cell on the second light-emitting cell side has a higher ink vapor concentration than the opposite end thereof. Thus the film thickness of the light-emitting layer tends to be larger at an end on the non-light-emitting cell side than at the end on the second light-emitting cell side. Accordingly, the light-emitting layer therein is likely to become uneven in film thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">However, in the above organic light-emitting panel according to an aspect of the present invention, among inner sidewalls facing each other in two adjacent banks defining the first light-emitting cell, a sidewall adjacent to a non-light-emitting cell has a larger inclination angle than a sidewall adjacent to the second light-emitting cell. With this structure, the pinning location of the ink in the sidewall on the non-light-emitting cell side is relatively higher than the pinning location of the ink in the sidewall on the second light-emitting cell side. This enables the film thickness of the organic light-emitting layer in the first light-emitting cell on the non-light-emitting cell side to be decreased. As a result, it is possible to prevent the organic light-emitting layer in the first light-emitting cell from becoming uneven in film thickness between two ends thereof (an end on the non-light-emitting cell side and an end on the second light-emitting cell side).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Furthermore, similarly to the above relationship between opposite sidewalls of two adjacent banks defining the first light-emitting cell, among inner sidewalls facing each other in two adjacent banks defining the third light-emitting cell, a sidewall adjacent to a non-light-emitting cell has a larger inclination angle than a sidewall adjacent to the second light-emitting cell. With this structure, the pinning location of the ink in the sidewall on the non-light-emitting cell side is relatively higher than the pinning location of the ink in the sidewall on the second light-emitting cell side. This enables the film thickness of the organic light-emitting layer in the first light-emitting cell on the non-light-emitting cell side to be decreased. As a result, it is possible to prevent the organic light-emitting layer in the third light-emitting cell from becoming uneven in film thickness between two ends thereof (an end on the non-light-emitting cell side and an end on the second light-emitting cell side).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As described above, in the above organic light-emitting panel according to an aspect of the present invention, it is possible to prevent the organic light-emitting layer in each light-emitting cell from becoming uneven in film thickness between two opposite ends thereof, providing excellent light-emitting characteristics in the same pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the above organic light-emitting panel according to an aspect of the present invention, each of the one or more non-light-emitting cells may include none of the organic light-emitting layers, may include a third electrode made of a same material as a material of the first electrodes, may be placed below the second electrode, and may electrically connect the third electrode with the second electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the organic light-emitting panel, it is general that the second electrode, which is located at an upper position (on the light extraction side) than the organic light-emitting layer, is made of a light-transmissive material (for example, ITO or IZO). However, these materials exhibit a high electrical resistance. In view of this, each non-light-emitting cell electrically connects the third electrode with the second electrode to decrease the electrical resistance, thereby securing excellent light-emitting characteristics and preventing a voltage drop even when the panel has a large size. The third electrode is, for example, a bus bar.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the above organic light-emitting panel according to an aspect of the present invention, the sidewall adjacent to a non-light-emitting cell among inner sidewalls facing each other in two adjacent banks defining the first light-emitting cell and the sidewall adjacent to a non-light-emitting cell among inner sidewalls facing each other in two adjacent banks defining the third light-emitting cell may have substantially equal inclination angles.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the above organic light-emitting panel according to an aspect of the present invention, each non-light-emitting cell is provided between adjacent pixels, and ink for forming the organic light-emitting cells is applied to the first, second and third light-emitting cells substantially at a same time, for each pixel. In this case, an end of the first light-emitting cell on the non-light-emitting cell side and an end of the third light-emitting cell on the non-light-emitting cell side have substantially the same ink vapor concentration.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">(Process by Which the Embodiment According to the Present Invention was Achieved)</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As a result of intense study, the inventor of the present invention discovered the following with regard to the organic light-emitting panel recited in the Background Art and the organic display device provided with the organic light-emitting panel.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Typically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, an anode <b>902</b> and an electrode coating layer <b>903</b> covering the anode <b>902</b> are formed on a substrate <b>901</b>, for each of sub-pixels <b>900</b><i>a</i>, <b>900</b><i>b</i>, and <b>900</b><i>c</i>. A hole injection layer <b>904</b> is then formed to cover the entire surface of the electrode coating layer <b>903</b> and the substrate <b>901</b>, and on the hole injection layer <b>904</b>, organic light-emitting layers <b>906</b><i>a</i>, <b>906</b><i>b</i>, and <b>906</b><i>c </i>of different colors are formed one-to-one in sub-pixels <b>900</b><i>a</i>, <b>900</b><i>b</i>, and <b>900</b><i>c</i>. The organic light-emitting layers <b>906</b><i>a</i>, <b>906</b><i>b</i>, and <b>906</b><i>c </i>are separated from each other by the banks formed to stand on the hole injection layer <b>904</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Also, in the organic light-emitting panel, for example, a pixel is composed of three sub-pixels <b>900</b><i>a</i>, <b>900</b><i>b</i>, and <b>900</b><i>c</i>, and non-light-emitting cells <b>900</b><i>d </i>and <b>900</b><i>e </i>are present between the pixel and adjacent pixels on both sides thereof. Each of the non-light-emitting cells <b>900</b><i>d </i>and <b>900</b><i>e </i>has a bus bar <b>932</b> and an electrode coating layer <b>933</b> covering the bus bar <b>932</b>, but does not have an organic light-emitting layer.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, in an organic light-emitting panel of a conventional technology, an uneven film thickness is observed in the organic light-emitting layers <b>906</b><i>a </i>and <b>906</b><i>c </i>of the sub-pixels <b>900</b><i>a </i>and <b>900</b><i>c </i>that are adjacent to the non-light-emitting cells <b>900</b><i>d </i>and <b>900</b><i>e</i>, respectively. More specifically, the organic light-emitting layer <b>906</b><i>a </i>in the sub-pixel <b>900</b><i>a </i>becomes higher at a point C<sub>3 </sub>near the bank <b>905</b><i>a </i>than at a point C<sub>4 </sub>near the bank <b>905</b><i>b </i>and also higher than the organic light-emitting layer <b>906</b><i>b </i>in the sub-pixel <b>900</b><i>b </i>at points C<sub>1 </sub>and C<sub>2 </sub>near the banks <b>905</b><i>b </i>and <b>905</b><i>c</i>. Similarly, the organic light-emitting layer <b>906</b><i>c </i>in the sub-pixel <b>900</b><i>c </i>becomes higher at a point C<sub>5 </sub>near the bank <b>905</b><i>d </i>than at a point C<sub>6 </sub>near the bank <b>905</b><i>c </i>and also higher than the organic light-emitting layer <b>906</b><i>b </i>in the sub-pixel <b>900</b><i>b </i>at points C<sub>1 </sub>and C<sub>2 </sub>near the banks <b>905</b><i>b </i>and <b>905</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">After repeated examination of the above phenomenon, the inventor assumed that reduction in uniformity of film thickness in the organic light-emitting layer is caused by a non-uniform vapor concentration distribution during ink drying, as described in the following. That is to say, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>, suppose a state in which ink <b>9060</b><i>c </i>for forming the organic light-emitting layer has been applied in an area between the bank <b>905</b><i>c </i>and the bank <b>905</b><i>d</i>, and the right-hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref> is lower than the left-hand side in vapor concentration distribution as indicated by the two dot chain line. In this case, the film thickness in the organic light-emitting layer becomes uneven for the following reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>, a surface profile L<sub>90 </sub>of ink <b>9060</b><i>c </i>has been swollen up at the center of the sub-pixel immediately after the ink is dripped. When drying the ink, due to the non-uniform vapor concentration distribution as mentioned above, the evaporation rate varies in reverse proportion to the vapor concentration, and therefore it can be theoretically considered that the ink changes to have a surface profile L<sub>91</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>, solvent in the ink <b>9061</b><i>c </i>flows during drying as shown by the dotted arrow L<sub>92</sub>. This is because solvent flows to compensate for solvent that has evaporated (i.e. flows to minimize surface free energy), and along with the flow of the solvent, the solute (organic light-emitting material) also flows. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21C</figref>, if the vapor concentration distribution is not uniform, the organic light-emitting layer <b>906</b><i>c </i>is formed to have a surface profile L<sub>93 </sub>in which the closer to the bank <b>905</b><i>d </i>the layer is, the higher the layer is (i.e. the layer is higher at the point C<sub>5 </sub>than at the point C<sub>6</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The inventor therefore deduced that, in an organic light-emitting panel, the film thickness of the organic light-emitting layer decreases in uniformity due to non-uniformity of vapor concentration distribution during ink drying.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">This led the inventor to reach a technical feature in which the bank sidewalls are made to have different inclination angles so that the bank sidewalls have different pinning locations, resulting in a uniform film thickness of the organic light-emitting layer.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The following describes an example of an embodiment of the present invention with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Note that the following Embodiment is simply an example to clearly illustrate a structure of the present invention and the acts and effects thereof. The present invention is in no way limited to the following Embodiment except in its essential characteristic elements.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">1. Configuration of Display Device <b>1</b></p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The overall structure of the display device <b>1</b> according to the present Embodiment is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the display device (organic display device) <b>1</b> includes a display panel unit <b>10</b> and a drive control unit <b>20</b> connected to the display panel unit <b>10</b>. The display panel unit <b>10</b> is an organic light-emitting panel that uses the phenomenon of electroluminescence occurring in organic material and is composed of a plurality of pixels arrayed two-dimensionally in the X-Y plane direction.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The drive control unit <b>20</b> is composed of four drive circuits <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> and a control circuit <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Note that in an actual display device <b>1</b>, the placement of the drive control unit <b>20</b> with respect to the display panel unit <b>10</b> is not limited in this way.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">2. Structure of Display Panel <b>10</b></p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The structure of the display panel <b>10</b> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Note that, as an example, the display panel <b>10</b> in the present Embodiment is a top emission type organic light-emitting panel including a plurality of pixels arranged in a matrix, each pixel including sub-pixels that are each provided with an organic light-emitting layer having a luminescent color of either red (R), green (G), or blue (B). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts one sub-pixel <b>100</b> in a pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the display panel <b>10</b>, an anode <b>102</b> is formed above a TFT substrate (hereinafter simply referred to as a &#x201c;substrate&#x201d;) <b>101</b>, and an electrode coating layer <b>103</b> and hole injection transporting layer <b>104</b> are layered above the anode <b>102</b> in this order. Note that the anode <b>102</b> and electrode coating layer <b>103</b> are formed separately for each sub-pixel <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Above the hole injection transporting layer <b>104</b>, banks <b>105</b>, made of insulating material, are provided to stand to separate the sub-pixels <b>100</b> from each other. An organic light-emitting layer <b>106</b> is formed in the region in each sub-pixel <b>100</b> separated by the banks <b>105</b>, and an electron injection layer <b>107</b>, cathode <b>108</b>, and passivation layer <b>109</b> are layered above the organic light-emitting layer <b>106</b> in this order.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">a) Substrate <b>101</b></p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The substrate <b>101</b> is made of a base of an insulating material such as alkali-free glass, soda glass, non-fluorescent glass, phosphate glass, borate glass, quartz, acrylic resin, styrenic resin, polycarbonate resin, epoxy resin, polyethylene, polyester, silicone resin, alumina, etc. Although not illustrated, in the substrate <b>101</b>, a TFT layer, a passivation film, an interlayer insulation film, etc. are laminated.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">b) Anode <b>102</b></p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The anode <b>102</b> is composed of a single layer or of a laminate of a plurality of layers, either being made of a conductive material, such as aluminum (Al), alloy including Al, silver (Ag), alloy of silver, palladium, and copper (APC), alloy of silver, rubidium, and gold (ARA), alloy of molybdenum and chromium (MoCr), alloy of nickel and chromium (NiCr), etc. Note that in the case of a top emission type panel such as the panel in the Embodiment, it is preferable that the anode <b>102</b> be made of a highly reflective material.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">c) Electrode Coating Layer <b>103</b></p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The electrode coating layer <b>103</b> is made of, for example, indium tin oxide (ITO) and covers at least a part of the top surface the anode <b>102</b> in the Z axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">d) Hole Injection Transporting Layer <b>104</b></p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The hole injection transporting layer <b>104</b> is a layer of an oxide such as silver (Ag), molybdenum (Mo), chromium (Cr), vanadium (V), tungsten (W), nickel (Ni), or iridium (Ir), or a conductive polymer material such as PEDOT (Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate)). A hole injection transporting layer <b>104</b> made of a metal oxide among the above materials has the function of assisting with hole generation and of injecting and transporting holes stably into the organic light-emitting layer <b>106</b>. The hole injection transporting layer <b>104</b> has a high work function.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">When the hole injection transporting layer <b>104</b> is made of an oxide of a transition metal, a plurality of levels can be occupied since there are a plurality of oxidation numbers. This makes hole injection easy and allows for reduction of driving voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">e) Banks <b>105</b></p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The banks <b>105</b> are made of an organic material such as resin and have insulating properties. Examples of the organic material used to form the banks <b>105</b> include acrylic resin, polyimide resin, novolac-type phenolic resin, etc. It is also preferable that the banks <b>105</b> have organic solvent resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Furthermore, since the banks <b>105</b> are etched and baked when formed, it is preferable that the banks be made of a highly resistant material that will not change in shape or quality during the etching and baking processes. To provide the banks with liquid repellency, the sidewalls can be fluoridated.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Note that as the insulating material used in forming the banks <b>105</b>, any liquid repellent material with a resistivity of 10<sup>5 </sup>&#x3a9;&#xb7;cm can be used, starting with the above materials. Using a material with a resistivity of less than 10<sup>5 </sup>&#x3a9;&#xb7;cm leads to production of leak current between the anode <b>102</b> and the cathode <b>108</b>, or between adjacent sub-pixels <b>100</b>, which causes a variety of problems such as increased power consumption.</p>

<p id="p-0166" num="0165">By setting the pinning locations Qaa and Qdc to be higher than the other pinning locations Qba, Qbb, Qcb, and Qcc, it is possible to prevent the formed organic light-emitting layer from having a non-uniform film thickness. More specifically, when an ink application method of applying the inks <b>1060</b><i>a</i>, <b>1060</b><i>b</i>, and <b>1060</b><i>c </i>substantially at the same time is adopted, due to the presence of the planned non-light-emitting cell formation regions <b>1000</b><i>d </i>and <b>1000</b><i>e </i>on the left-hand side of the planned sub-pixel formation region <b>1000</b><i>a </i>and on the right-hand side of the planned sub-pixel formation region <b>1000</b><i>c </i>respectively, non-uniformity of vapor concentration distribution in the horizontal direction arises in each of the planned sub-pixel formation regions <b>1000</b><i>a </i>and <b>1000</b><i>c</i>. In such a case, by setting the respective inclination angles &#x3b8;aa and &#x3b8;dc of the sidewalls <b>105</b><i>aa </i>and <b>105</b><i>dc </i>of the banks <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>d </i>to be larger than those of the other sidewalls, the formed organic light-emitting layer <b>106</b> can be prevented from having a non-uniform film thickness.</p>

<p id="h-0015" num="0000">[Verification of Manufacturing Method]</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">Using a concrete example, the shape of the banks after formation was verified for the manufacturing methods of the above Embodiment and Modifications 1 and 2. The results are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, the larger the amount of exposure is, the larger the inclination angle of a sidewall of a formed bank is. More specifically, when the exposure and development are performed with 200 mJ of exposure amount, the inclination angle of a sidewall of the formed bank is 23&#xb0;, whereas when the exposure and development are performed with 300 mJ of exposure amount, the inclination angle of a sidewall of the formed bank is 38&#xb0;. The results are also shown by the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>, when the exposure and development in the first round is performed with 200 mJ of exposure amount and then the exposure and development in the second round is performed with 100 mJ of exposure amount, the inclination angle of a sidewall of the formed bank is 50&#xb0;. This corresponds to the manufacturing method of Modification 2 and is considered to be effective in creating a large inclination angle of the bank sidewall.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Note that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, the horizontal axis represents the horizontal direction, and the vertical axis represents the direction of height.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">[Other Considerations]</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">Firstly, in the above Embodiment and Modifications 1 and 2, it is schematically illustrated that the surface of each sidewall of the banks <b>105</b>, <b>105</b><i>a</i>-<b>105</b><i>d</i>, <b>105</b><i>x</i>, and <b>105</b><i>y </i>is planar. However, the surface of each sidewall of the banks may not necessarily be planar. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> illustrates a bank <b>605</b> whose sidewall has two surfaces: a surface extending from a point P<sub>61 </sub>to a point P<sub>62</sub>; and a surface extending from the point P<sub>62 </sub>to a point P<sub>63</sub>. In this case, a pinning location Qy<b>1</b> during ink application is present on the surface between the points P<sub>62 </sub>and P<sub>63</sub>. Here, an inclination angle &#x3b8;y<b>2</b> formed between this the surface and a virtual straight line L<sub>1 </sub>passing through the point P<sub>62 </sub>is important in the relationship with the pinning location.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">However, the angle &#x3b8;y<b>2</b> can be controlled by controlling an angle &#x3b8;y<b>1</b>, which is formed between the surface of the underlying layer, namely the hole injection transporting layer <b>104</b>, and the surface between points P<sub>61 </sub>and P<sub>62 </sub>of the sidewall of the bank <b>605</b>, when the bank <b>605</b> is formed. Thus, in the actuality, the above effects can be obtained by controlling the inclination angle &#x3b8;y<b>1</b>. For example, if a bank <b>705</b> is formed such that an angle &#x3b8;y<b>11</b> formed between the surface of the hole injection transporting layer <b>104</b> and a surface between points P<sub>71 </sub>and P<sub>72 </sub>is larger than the angle &#x3b8;y<b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>), then an angle &#x3b8;y<b>12</b> formed between a surface between points P<sub>72 </sub>and P<sub>73 </sub>and a virtual straight line L<sub>2 </sub>also becomes larger than the angle &#x3b8;y<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Secondly, in the above Embodiment and Modifications 1 and 2, it is not specified to what part of the region of the display panel <b>10</b> the above-described structure can be applied. However, the above-described structure may be applied to the entire region of the display panel, or may be applied to a part of the region. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the display panel <b>10</b> can be divided formally into areas <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>in a direction along the surface of the display panel <b>10</b>, wherein the area <b>10</b><i>a </i>is located at the center, and the area <b>10</b><i>b </i>surrounds the area <b>10</b><i>a</i>. The area <b>10</b><i>a </i>is connected to a source electrode or a drain electrode of the TFT layer below which the anodes are formed, and contributes to the emission of light. On the other hand, the area <b>10</b><i>b </i>is not connected to any of the source electrode and drain electrode of the TFT layer below which the anodes are formed, and does not contribute to the emission of light. It is considered that, if the area <b>10</b><i>a </i>is further divided formally into a central area <b>10</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> and a surrounding area <b>10</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>, the uneven film thickness in the organic light-emitting layers of the sub-pixels in the surrounding area <b>10</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> would be more prominent due to the state of vapor concentration distribution during the application of ink.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Note that the combined area of the surrounding area <b>10</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> and the area <b>10</b><i>b </i>may occupy approximately 0.5% to several percent (for example, 1%) of the total area of the panel. This range is determined by taking account of the variation in film thickness of the organic light-emitting layers when the inclination angles of the bank sidewalls are not adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">In the above Embodiment and Modifications 1 and 2, the structures are adopted by way of example to clearly explain the structure, acts and effects of the present invention. Accordingly, the present invention is not limited to the above structures, except for such portions that are essential to the present invention. For example, the above Embodiment has adopted, as one example, a structure in which the anodes <b>102</b> are located below the organic light-emitting layers <b>106</b> in the Z axis direction, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. However, not limited to this structure, the present invention may adopt a structure in which the cathodes <b>108</b> are located below the organic light-emitting layers <b>106</b> in the Z axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">The display panel has the top-emission structure when it adopts the structure in which the cathodes <b>108</b> are located below the organic light-emitting layers <b>106</b> in the Z axis direction. In that case, the cathodes <b>108</b> become the reflecting electrode layers, and the electrode coating layers <b>103</b> are formed above the cathodes <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Furthermore, the above Embodiment and Modifications do not provide a specific example of the appearance of the display device <b>1</b>. However, the display device <b>1</b> may be formed as a part of a system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, for example. Note that an organic EL display device does not require a backlight as a liquid crystal display device does, and thus is suitable for thin display devices and has excellent characteristics from the view point of system design.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">Also, in the above Embodiment and Modifications 1 and 2, a so-called line bank structure is adopted for the banks <b>105</b>, <b>105</b><i>a</i>-<b>105</b><i>f</i>, <b>105</b><i>x</i>, <b>105</b><i>y</i>, <b>605</b>, and <b>705</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. However, not limited to this, the structure of pixel bank <b>805</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> may be adopted. In this structure, a display panel <b>80</b> includes the pixel bank <b>805</b> which is composed of bank elements <b>805</b><i>a </i>and bank elements <b>805</b><i>b</i>, wherein the bank elements <b>805</b><i>a </i>extend in the Y axis direction and the bank elements <b>805</b><i>b </i>extend in the X axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, when the structure of pixel bank <b>805</b> is adopted, the same advantageous effects as the above ones can be obtained by increasing the inclination angles of the sidewalls of the bank <b>805</b> in the X and Y axis directions defining the sub-pixels <b>800</b><i>a</i>, <b>800</b><i>b</i>, and <b>800</b><i>c</i>. More specifically, the above advantageous effects can be obtained by appropriately adjusting the inclination angles of the sidewalls indicated by the arrows B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub>, and B<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">Also, the inclination angles of the sidewalls of the banks adopted in the above Embodiment and Modifications 1 and 2 may be individually adjusted depending on the vapor concentration distribution observed in the ink application process and drying process when the organic light-emitting layers are formed in the manufacturing process. For example, if the drying device used in the ink drying process has a structure where the vapor flows from the outer circumference of the panel toward the center of the panel, bank sidewalls where the organic light-emitting layers are large in film thickness may have increased inclination angles. This enables the film thickness of the organic light-emitting layers to be uniform, thereby reducing the unevenness in luminance over the entire panel.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">In the above Embodiment and in Modifications 1 and 2, the inclination angle (i.e. taper angle) of bank sidewalls is set in the same manner, without distinction between the luminescent colors (red, green, and blue). However, there may be a case where the organic light-emitting materials of the ink for the respective luminescent colors have different characteristics. In that case, the inclination angles of the bank sidewalls may be defined in accordance with the ink characteristics of each luminescent color.</p>

<p id="p-0207" num="0206">The present invention is useful for providing an organic light-emitting panel and an organic display device that exhibit substantially even luminance and are capable of displaying high-quality images.</p>
