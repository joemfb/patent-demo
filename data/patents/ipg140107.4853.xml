<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Reference will now be made in detail to the exemplary aspects of the present disclosure that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like structure.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an optical fiber assembly <b>10</b> is shown. The optical fiber assembly <b>10</b> includes at least one optical fiber <b>12</b>, a core <b>14</b>, a strength member <b>16</b> and an outer covering <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The optical fiber assembly <b>10</b> is suitable for use in a security device that is adapted to sense contaminants in the air. In one embodiment, the contaminants collect on the optical fiber <b>12</b> of the optical fiber assembly <b>10</b> of the security device. Light passing through the optical fiber <b>12</b> of the optical fiber assembly <b>10</b> is reflected off the contaminants. The reflected light can be analyzed to determine the type of contaminant.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the depicted embodiment, the fiber optic cable assembly <b>10</b> includes a plurality of optical fibers <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, the fiber optic cable assembly <b>10</b> includes twelve optical fibers <b>12</b>. In another embodiment, the fiber optic cable assembly <b>10</b> includes at least twelve optical fibers <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the optical fiber <b>12</b> is shown. The optical fiber <b>12</b> can have any number of configurations. In the depicted embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the optical fiber <b>12</b> includes a core <b>20</b>. The core <b>20</b> is made of a glass material, such as a silica-based material, having an index of refraction. In the subject embodiment, the core <b>20</b> has an outer diameter D<sub>1 </sub>of less than or equal to about 10 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The core <b>20</b> of each optical fiber <b>12</b> is surrounded by a first cladding layer <b>22</b> that is also made of a glass material, such as a silica based-material. The first cladding layer <b>22</b> has an index of refraction that is less than the index of refraction of the core <b>20</b>. This difference between the index of refraction of the first cladding layer <b>22</b> and the index of refraction of the core <b>20</b> allows an optical signal that is transmitted through the optical fiber <b>12</b> to be confined to the core <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A second cladding layer <b>24</b> surrounds the first cladding layer <b>22</b>. The second cladding layer <b>24</b> has an index of refraction. In the subject embodiment, the index of refraction of the second cladding layer <b>24</b> is about equal to the index of refraction of the first cladding layer <b>22</b>. The second cladding layer <b>24</b> is immediately adjacent to the first cladding layer <b>22</b>. In the subject embodiment, the second cladding layer <b>24</b> has an outer diameter D<sub>2 </sub>of less than or equal to 125 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A coating, generally designated <b>26</b>, surrounds the second cladding layer <b>24</b>. The coating <b>26</b> includes an inner layer <b>28</b> and an outer layer <b>30</b>. In the subject embodiment, the inner layer <b>28</b> of the coating <b>26</b> is immediately adjacent to the second cladding layer <b>24</b> such that the inner layer <b>28</b> surrounds the second cladding layer <b>24</b>. The inner layer <b>28</b> is a polymeric material (e.g., polyvinyl chloride, polyethylenes, polyurethanes, polypropylenes, polyvinylidene fluorides, ethylene vinyl acetate, nylon, polyester, or other materials) having a low modulus of elasticity. The low modulus of elasticity of the inner layer <b>28</b> functions to protect the optical fiber <b>12</b> from microbending.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The outer layer <b>30</b> of the coating <b>26</b> is a polymeric material having a higher modulus of elasticity than the inner layer <b>28</b>. In the subject embodiment, the outer layer <b>30</b> of the coating <b>26</b> is immediately adjacent to the inner layer <b>28</b> such that the outer layer <b>30</b> surrounds the inner layer <b>28</b>. The higher modulus of elasticity of the outer layer <b>30</b> functions to mechanically protect and retain the shape of optical fiber <b>12</b> during handling. In the subject embodiment, the outer layer <b>30</b> defines an outer diameter D<sub>3 </sub>of less than or equal to 300 &#x3bc;m. In another embodiment, the outer diameter D<sub>3 </sub>of the outer layer <b>30</b> is less than or equal to 250 &#x3bc;m. In another embodiment, the outer diameter D<sub>3 </sub>of the outer layer <b>30</b> is less than or equal to 200 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the core <b>14</b> of the optical fiber assembly <b>10</b> will be described. The core <b>14</b> includes a central portion <b>32</b> and a plurality of fins <b>34</b>. The fins <b>34</b> extend radially outward from the central portion <b>32</b>. In the depicted embodiment, the core <b>14</b> includes four fins <b>34</b>. The core <b>14</b> of the depicted embodiment includes a first fin <b>34</b><i>a</i>, a second fin <b>34</b><i>b</i>, a third fin <b>34</b><i>c </i>and a fourth fin <b>34</b><i>d</i>. Each of the fins <b>34</b> is symmetrically disposed about the central portion <b>32</b> of the core <b>14</b>. In the depicted embodiment, each of the fins <b>34</b> is disposed 90 degrees from the immediately adjacent fins <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each of the fins <b>34</b> includes a base end <b>36</b> and an oppositely disposed free end <b>38</b>. The base end <b>36</b> is connected to the central portion <b>32</b> of the core <b>14</b>. In the depicted embodiment, the base end <b>36</b> and the central portion <b>32</b> are monolithic (i.e., an integral connection without a seam, joint, weld, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the depicted embodiment, the base end <b>36</b> of each of the fins <b>34</b> is joined to the central portion <b>32</b> of the core <b>14</b> by a fillet <b>37</b>. The fillet <b>37</b> has a radius R.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each of the fins <b>34</b> includes a first surface <b>40</b> and an oppositely disposed second surface <b>42</b>. Each of the first and second surfaces <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> extends between the base and free ends <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> of the fin <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the depicted embodiment, the free end <b>38</b> includes a first projection <b>44</b><i>a </i>that extends outwardly from the first surface <b>40</b> of the fin <b>34</b> in a direction that is generally perpendicular to the fin <b>34</b>. The free end <b>38</b> further includes a second projection <b>44</b><i>b </i>that extends outwardly from the second surface <b>42</b> of the fin <b>34</b> in a direction that is generally perpendicular to the fin <b>34</b>.</p>

In one embodiment, the take-up roll <b>142</b> is stationary. The rotation of the core <b>14</b> about the longitudinal axis <b>120</b> of the strength member <b>16</b> causes the core <b>14</b> to coil around the spooling portion <b>146</b> of the take-up roll <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In another embodiment, the take-up roll <b>142</b> is rotated by a drive mechanism <b>148</b>. In one embodiment, the speed at which the drive mechanism <b>148</b> rotates the take-up roll <b>142</b> about an axis <b>150</b> of the take-up roll <b>142</b> is variable. The rotation of the take-up roll <b>142</b> may prevent twisting of the core <b>14</b> as more layers are coiled around the spooling portion <b>142</b>.
