<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A spacing apparatus singulates and spaces items for further processing and packaging. The apparatus comprises a rotatable dispensing wheel member having apertures for receiving items, such as food parts. The apertures are configured to place the items in a consistent alignment on a conveyor system. As the dispensing wheel rotates, the items are deposited from the apertures sequentially and with consistent positioning on a conveyor system that transports the singularized items to a measuring point. The rate of rotation of the dispensing wheel member can be controlled by a controller. A guide disposed above the dispensing wheel member provides greater accuracy in depositing items into the slots.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/436,455, filed Jan. 26, 2011, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/451,382, filed Mar. 10, 2011, which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosed technology relates to devices for singulating and spacing items. More specifically, the present disclosed subject matter concerns moving spacing members for substantially fixing distances between food items placed on a conveyor system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In item processing facilities, items are sorted and packaged according to certain attributes such as weight, size, shape, etc. For example, the attributes of the food items are determined followed by the sorting and packaging of the food items according to one or more of the measured attributes. Apparatuses and methods for determining attributes of food items generally require that a single food items be removed from a bulk loading system at a first location, placed on a conveyor system for transport to a second location, and then moved via the conveyor system to a device for measuring the attribute of each single food item, such as a scale. Thereafter, the single food item is sorted based on its attributes and packaged accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The process of measuring the attributes of food items is typically carried out by continuously moving machinery, which generally must handle a large number of food items in relatively rapid fashion. The measuring devices in such processes are generally adapted to perform measurements rapidly as the items align with or pass through a measuring point, such as a scale weigh deck. Given the fast-moving, high-volume nature of food processing operations, the potential for error at any point in the process is great because a measurement must take place for each individual food item. An inaccurate measurement may occur when a food item is placed out of alignment with the measuring point, or when multiple food items are not properly separated and, thus, pass the measuring point simultaneously. Inaccurate measurement of food items due to imprecise loading, sorting, and conveying may cause inconsistencies in the resulting sorting and packaging of the food items which can adversely affect business concerns. For example, if the food items are sorted and packaged into a fixed-price packaged food product, and the attributes of the food items in the fixed-price packaged product deviates from the expected norm, the contents of the packaging will not be as expected resulting in dissatisfaction of the customer, and dissatisfaction of the retailer because the profit margin may be less than expected.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A rotary spacing apparatus is provided for spacing items on a conveyor system in a processing operation so that the items, such as food items, are collected, sorted for measurement and then passed on for further processing such as placement in packaging. In an aspect of the disclosed technology, a picker apparatus transfers food times from a food item storage reservoir to the conveyor system by first placing the food items into a slot in the moving spacing apparatus. The spacing apparatus includes a body, such as a wheel member that rotates about an axis above an engagement plate member. One or more arcuate slots are disposed in a concentric annular fashion about the axis for receiving the food items from the picker apparatus. A back edge of each slot centers the food item as it rotates across the engagement plate member. The food item passes off of the engagement plate member and falls through the slot, by gravity, onto the conveyor system as the back edge of each slot passes over the forward edge of the engagement plate member.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The quantity of food items deposited on the conveyor system may be varied by increasing or decreasing the number of arcuate slots in the spacing apparatus, or by increasing or decreasing the speed the spacing apparatus rotates. In and embodiment of the disclosed subject matter, the rate of rotation of the spacing apparatus is effectuated by a controller.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A guide may be positioned between the picker apparatus and the rotary spacing apparatus for providing greater accuracy in transferring food items from the picker apparatus into the slots.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present teachings will become better understood with reference to the following description, examples and appended claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The disclosed technology is described with reference to the drawing figures, in which like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout. The disclosed subject matter is used in connection with a high-volume, enhanced-speed food processing systems having a capability to measure individual food products for certain attributes while the items are conveyed by a conveyor system prior to packaging or other processing functions. While such high-volume, enhanced-speed processing systems, and therefore the present disclosed technology, can be used for a wide variety of items, including non-food items, for purposes of illustrating the disclosed technology, the food products described herein may comprise chicken parts, such as wings, legs, breasts, and the like. In particular, the food processing system generally has an ability to measure the weight or size of the food product, whereby food products having attributes meeting predetermined weight or size standards are identified and passed on through the system for further processing according to packaging or other processing functions. The measuring and downstream processing functions of the overall food processing system do not themselves form part of the present disclosed technology, but are referenced herein to provide context to the structure and function of various embodiments of the technology.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> generally shows a component of an item processing system <b>10</b> that may be used in conjunction with the disclosed subject matter. In an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter, the item processing system <b>10</b> processes food items, such as chicken parts, and includes a picker apparatus <b>16</b> that transfers food items <b>31</b> from a food item storage reservoir <b>14</b> to a conveyor system <b>36</b>. The conveyor system <b>36</b> transports the food items <b>31</b> to a measuring apparatus (not shown) adapted to measure defined attributes of the food items <b>31</b>. The measuring apparatus for performing the measuring functions can be of the type found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,881,907 to Winkelmolen (2005) the specification of which is incorporated herein by reference. The measuring function is generally carried out as the food items are transported in sequential array along a conveyor belt or other moving device and pass in sequence within the measuring field of the measuring device. Given the high-volume, enhanced-speed nature of the measuring event(s), it is crucial that the food items are placed on the conveyor belt with substantial precision so that an accurate measurement can occur. The measuring device is generally oriented such that it measures an item when it passes a defined position. Measurement of the item may also require that it pass the defined position at a defined time. If the food item is placed out of sequential alignment on the conveyor belt such that it does not precisely pass the defined position, or passes the defined position outside of the defined time, an inaccurate measurement is likely to be made.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An embodiment of the present disclosed technology comprises a spacing apparatus <b>12</b> that receives food items <b>31</b> from the picker apparatus <b>16</b>, and that spaces the food items <b>31</b> along the conveyor system <b>36</b> in a sequential, spaced relationship so the food items <b>31</b> may be measured by the measuring apparatus. The picker apparatus <b>16</b> transfers food items <b>31</b> from the food item storage reservoir <b>14</b> to the spacing apparatus <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The food item storage reservoir <b>14</b> houses food items of various shapes and sizes. The picker apparatus <b>16</b> comprises any suitable device for uptake of an individual food item <b>31</b> from the food item storage reservoir <b>14</b> and release of the individual food items <b>31</b> into the spacing apparatus <b>12</b>. In particular, the picker apparatus <b>16</b> includes a plurality of picker elements <b>30</b> for uptake and release of food items whereby the picker elements <b>30</b> can include vacuum heads, piercing arms, gripper arms, or frozen tip pickup apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The spacing apparatus <b>12</b> generally comprises a body with spacing apertures that passes over the conveyor system <b>36</b>. The apertures pass from the top surface to the bottom surface of the body. In particular, the body is a cylindrical dispensing wheel member <b>22</b> with an axis <b>26</b>, and the apertures are a series of elongated arcuate slots <b>24</b> extending between a front edge <b>32</b> and a back edge <b>40</b>, and are disposed in a concentric annular fashion about the axis <b>26</b>. The dispensing wheel member <b>22</b> rotates about the axis <b>26</b> such that the slots <b>24</b> revolve in a circular orbit above the conveyor system <b>36</b>. The picker apparatus <b>16</b> is programmed to transfer a single food item <b>31</b> into each slot <b>24</b> using a picker element <b>30</b> as the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b> rotates beneath. In an embodiment, the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b> rotates counter clockwise. Various controller arrangements for programming the rate at which food items <b>31</b> are gathered and released by the picker apparatus <b>16</b> are known to those skilled in the art. For example, the embodiment shown in the drawings includes a controller arrangement using a belt and gear drive assembly <b>28</b> by which the rate of release of food pieces by the picker apparatus <b>16</b> can be coordinated with the rotation of the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b> to accurately deposit food items <b>31</b> into each slot <b>24</b> in the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b> as it rotates into position below the release point of the picker element <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A stationary slide plate or engagement plate member <b>34</b> is disposed below, and in close proximity to (e.g., adjacent), the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b> for providing support to the food items <b>31</b> and to prevent them from initially falling through the slot <b>24</b> prior to their release position above the conveyor system <b>36</b>. The engagement plate member <b>34</b> has an upper surface that is only partially coextensive with the bottom surface of the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b>. As such, the slots <b>24</b> move into and out of alignment and overlap with the engagement plate member <b>34</b> as the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b> rotates. As the slots <b>24</b> rotate counter clockwise with a food item <b>31</b> deposited therein, and the food item <b>31</b> moves to a position beyond a forward edge <b>25</b> of the engagement plate member <b>34</b>, the food piece drops by gravity downward through the slot <b>24</b> onto the conveyor belt <b>38</b> of the conveyor system <b>36</b> below. As each slot <b>24</b> rotates over and past the forward edge <b>25</b> of the engagement plate member <b>34</b>, the food items <b>31</b> located within are sequentially deposited at a measured rate onto the conveyor system <b>36</b>. The rate at which the food items <b>31</b> are deposited on the conveyor system <b>36</b> corresponds to the rate of rotation of the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b>. The spacing of the food items <b>31</b> on the conveyor system <b>36</b> relates to the location of the back edge <b>40</b> of each slot <b>24</b>. Because the engagement plate member <b>34</b> and the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b> are in close proximity to one another, the food items <b>31</b> remain within the spacing apertures <b>24</b> until the back edge <b>40</b> passes the forward edge <b>25</b> of the engagement plate member <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The back edge <b>40</b> of each slot <b>24</b> is an arcuate, bilaterally curved surface for guiding the food item <b>31</b> into a centralized position within the slot <b>24</b> as the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b> rotates above the engagement plate member <b>34</b>. Centering the food item <b>31</b> within the slot <b>24</b> ensures the food item <b>31</b> is deposited in a consistent position on the conveyor system <b>36</b> as the back edge <b>40</b> of the slot <b>24</b> passes over the forward edge <b>25</b> of the engagement plate member <b>34</b>. As such, the trailing edge <b>21</b> of each food item <b>31</b> is positioned a known distance from the trailing edge <b>21</b> of the proceeding food item <b>31</b>, and the following food item <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Accuracy of the placement of the food item <b>31</b> is further controlled by minimizing the distance between the engagement plate member <b>34</b> and the conveyor system <b>36</b> thereby minimizing the deceleration of the food item <b>31</b> as they transition from the engagement plate member <b>34</b> to the conveyor belt <b>38</b>. The upper surface of the engagement plate member <b>34</b> extends from a forward edge <b>25</b> adjacent the release point of the picker apparatus <b>16</b> and around in an arch of about one hundred seventy degrees and terminating at another forward edge <b>25</b> adjacent the conveyor system <b>36</b>. In an embodiment, the conveyor system <b>36</b> extends away from the spacing apparatus <b>12</b> generally parallel to the picker apparatus <b>16</b> the food item storage reservoir <b>14</b>. In alternative embodiments, the forward edge <b>25</b> of the engagement plate member <b>34</b> is extended or shortened to an arch between about forty five degrees to about two hundred degrees to accommodate a conveyor system that extends away from the picker apparatus <b>16</b> and food item storage reservoir <b>14</b> at another angle.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The downstream measuring device can be calibrated to perform measurements of the food items <b>31</b> on the conveyor system <b>36</b> relative to the rate of rotation of the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b>, the rate of advancement of the conveyor belt <b>38</b>, or the spatial distances between the back edge <b>40</b> of each slot <b>24</b>. Alternatively, the rate of rotation of the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b>, the rate of advancement of the conveyor belt <b>38</b>, or the spatial distances between the back edge <b>40</b> of each slot <b>24</b> may be calibrated in relation to the rate of measurement by the measuring device.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an embodiment, the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b> is operatively connected to a controller for effecting rotational movement. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b> driven by a shaft <b>26</b> which is connected to a belt and gear drive assembly <b>28</b>. Alternatively, the shaft <b>26</b> may be driven directly by a motor. Where rotation of dispensing wheel member <b>22</b> is driven at a cooperative rate with that of the picker apparatus <b>16</b>, the belt and gear drive assembly <b>28</b> may be arranged to simultaneously operate the picker apparatus <b>16</b> and dispensing wheel member <b>22</b>. Appropriate gearing may be provided to affect different rates of rotation of the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b> and picker apparatus <b>16</b>, respectively, to control the relative rates of feeding food items <b>31</b> to the spacing apparatus <b>12</b>. Factors assessed in determining the appropriate rate of rotation of dispensing wheel member <b>22</b> include: 1) the measuring rate capability of the downstream measuring device; 2) the speed of the conveyor belt <b>38</b> conveying items to the measuring device; or 3) the distance between back edge <b>40</b> of the slots <b>24</b> in the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b>. The dispensing wheel member <b>22</b> can be configured with varying number of slots <b>24</b> where for a given rate of rotation, the number of slots <b>24</b> may affect the desired rate of rotation in that, the greater the number of slots <b>24</b> the faster the rate of sequentially deposited food items <b>31</b>. These known variables can be mathematically combined to achieve the appropriate rate of rotation of the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b> to yield the desired spacing of food items <b>31</b> deposited on the conveyor system <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an embodiment, the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b> can be configured to have multiple slots depending on the desired rate and volume of food items to be processed. A dual array of slots can be provided in the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b>, with a first set of slots <b>24</b> at an outer annular position and a second set of slots <b>42</b> at an inner annular position. With the additional laterally spaced slots, the spacing apparatus <b>12</b> is able to accommodate multiple food items <b>31</b> from the picker apparatus <b>16</b>. Because the slots <b>42</b> are in an inner portion of the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b> compared to slots <b>24</b>, the slots <b>42</b> travel a shorter distance and speed across the engagement plate member <b>34</b> than slots <b>24</b>. Therefore, in order for the food items <b>31</b> to be accurately placed on the conveyor belt <b>38</b>, the engagement plate member <b>34</b> is configured with an angled forward edge <b>25</b> so that the food items <b>31</b> are dispensed from the spacing apparatus <b>12</b> is a staggered manner.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In another embodiment, the spacing apparatus <b>12</b> includes a cylindrical bin <b>18</b> with walls <b>20</b> to keep the food items <b>31</b> from falling out of the spacing apparatus <b>12</b> before they can be singularized. The repeated handling of raw food items <b>31</b>, such as chicken parts, can create a substantial buildup of blood, grease, flesh, and the like. Therefore, the walls <b>20</b> can be designed to pivot, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and swing away or be removed to allow cleaning of the bin <b>18</b>, spacing apparatus <b>12</b>, or the picker apparatus <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another embodiment, a guide is provided for ensuring that food items <b>31</b> are properly deposited in the slots in the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b>. An embodiment of a food item <b>31</b> depositing guide <b>50</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> in use with a dispensing wheel member having both inner slots <b>42</b> and outer slots <b>24</b>. The guide <b>50</b> is disposed between the picker apparatus <b>16</b> and the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b> to direct food items <b>31</b> released from the picker apparatus <b>16</b> into the slots <b>42</b>, <b>24</b>. Because the picker apparatus <b>16</b> can remove food items <b>31</b> from the food item storage reservoir <b>14</b> at such a rapid pace, the food items <b>31</b> may be released from the picker element <b>30</b> whereby their path of decent may deviate from a decent straight down such that they may fall outside the slots <b>24</b> and <b>42</b>. In the embodiment show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, a guide <b>50</b> is shown comprising a guide member <b>52</b> with at least one channel <b>54</b>. The width of channel <b>54</b> should have a sufficient dimension to catch a deposited food item <b>31</b> that may be swinging back and forth at the point where it is released from the picker apparatus <b>16</b>. Similarly, the length of channel <b>54</b> should be of a sufficient dimension to catch a deposited food item <b>31</b> that may be swinging back and forth in that relative direction.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The guide <b>50</b> is stationary with respect to the rotation of both the picker apparatus <b>16</b> and the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the guide <b>50</b> is mounted in a position on mounting arm <b>56</b>. When the dispensing wheel member <b>22</b> is provided with a dual array of slots <b>24</b> and <b>42</b>, the guide <b>50</b> may have dual channels <b>54</b>, one each in alignment with the each of the slot arrays. The channel <b>54</b> may comprise side walls <b>60</b> having a depth, such as an inch or more to guide the dropping items into a straight descent into the slots <b>24</b> and <b>42</b>. The front edges <b>58</b> of the guide member <b>52</b> may be curved to catch and urge in food items <b>31</b> that may fall just outside of the width of the front of the channel <b>54</b>.</p>
