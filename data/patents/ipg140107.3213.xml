<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates in general to methods for forming light emitting modules. More specifically, this invention relates to methods for forming light emitting modules including a substrate including multi-colored light emitting diodes.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Liquid crystal displays have been recently replacing traditional CRTs in applications like computer monitors and TVs. A liquid crystal display includes a glass cell as a light valve and a back light module as a light source. Back light modules usually comprise cold cathode fluorescent lamps and light directors. After light is emitted from the back light modules, it may be polarized first in order to be controlled by the aligned liquid crystals in the liquid crystal cell. Therefore, a first polarizer may be attached at the rear side of the glass cell and a second polarizer attached at the front side of the glass cell for controlling light emission in a transmission type liquid crystal display. After light goes through the first polarizer, at least half of the light energy would be blocked and can not contribute to the display. Therefore, several other display technologies have been developed to eliminate the use of polarizers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, light emitting diode-based displays have become a promising light source for displays. For example, light emitting diodes (LED) can be the light source of a projective type display. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a projective type display having LED array chips as its light source. The projective type display includes three single-colored LED array substrates <b>1</b>R, <b>1</b>G, and <b>1</b>B, a dichroic lens <b>2</b>, a projection lens <b>3</b>, and a screen <b>4</b>. Red light from red-colored LED substrate <b>1</b>R, green light from green-colored LED substrate <b>1</b>G, and blue light from blue-colored LED substrate <b>1</b>B are mixed at dichroic lens <b>2</b> and are projected to the screen <b>2</b> via projection lens <b>3</b>. Each substrate comprises only single-colored LED chips. An instance of such a substrate <b>1</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In this display, no liquid crystal panels or polarizers are needed, so light energy efficiency is improved as compared to the traditional liquid crystal display. But there is a need to integrate three-colored LED chips into one substrate to reduce the cost of light sources.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Reference will now be made in detail to the present embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Consistent with embodiments of the present invention, there are provided methods for forming a micro-chip LED light source. A plurality of the micro-chip LED structures may be integrated on a single substrate and serves as a light source, for example, a light source for a projection display or a liquid crystal display.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an embodiment consistent with the principles of the present invention. A light source <b>10</b> includes a plurality of pixels <b>11</b> arranged on a substrate <b>12</b> to form an array. The substrate may include, for example, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, GaAs, GaP, and SiC, or any combination of these materials. Each pixel <b>11</b> may at least comprise two micro-chip LED structures and each micro-chip LED structure may emit a different color of light. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, each pixel may include a red-colored LED, a green-colored LED, and a blue-colored LED, for example, so that a user of such light source can obtain a preferred color and intensity of light.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a light emitting module including LED devices consistent with principles of the present invention. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a pixel <b>11</b> of the light emitting module <b>10</b> may include three micro-chip LED structures <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, and <b>15</b> formed on a substrate <b>12</b>. At least one of the three micro-chip LED structures <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, and <b>15</b> emits a color of light different from the others. In one aspect, the three micro-chip LED structures all emit different colors of light. For example, micro-chip LED structure <b>13</b> emits red light; micro-chip LED structure <b>14</b> emits green light; and micro-chip LED structure <b>15</b> emits blue light. By this arrangement, each pixel can produce a wide range of color. A process of forming pixel <b>11</b> will be explained as follows. A lower layer <b>13</b><i>a </i>of micro-chip LED structure <b>13</b> is formed on substrate <b>12</b>. An upper layer <b>13</b><i>c </i>and a light-emitting active layer <b>13</b><i>b </i>are formed on the lower layer <b>13</b><i>a</i>. Layers <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>, and <b>13</b><i>c </i>may be deposited, for example, by conventional deposition techniques such as physical vapor deposition or chemical vapor deposition. In a process of forming upper layer <b>13</b><i>c </i>and light-emitting active layer <b>13</b><i>b</i>, at least a portion of an upper surface of lower layer <b>13</b><i>a </i>may be left uncovered by upper layer <b>13</b><i>c </i>and light-emitting active layer <b>13</b><i>b</i>. An electrode pad <b>13</b><i>d </i>is formed on the exposed upper surface of lower layer <b>13</b><i>a</i>, and a lead line (not shown) may be coupled to electrode pad <b>13</b><i>d </i>for inputting an electric current into the light-emitting active layer <b>13</b><i>b</i>. Similarly, an electrode pad <b>13</b><i>e </i>may be formed on a portion of an upper surface of upper layer <b>13</b><i>c</i>, and a lead line (not shown) may be coupled to electrode pad <b>13</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Micro-chip LED structures <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> each may be formed using the same method as described above for forming micro-chip LED structure <b>13</b> on substrate <b>12</b>. Electrode pads on each micro-chip LED structure <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, and <b>15</b> may be formed, for example, simultaneously. For example, layers <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>, and <b>13</b><i>c </i>of micro-chip LED structure <b>13</b>; layers <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>, and <b>14</b><i>c </i>of micro-chip LED structure <b>14</b>; layers <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, and <b>15</b><i>c </i>of micro-chip LED structure <b>15</b> may first be formed on substrate <b>12</b>, and electrode pads <b>13</b><i>d</i>, <b>13</b><i>e</i>, <b>14</b><i>d</i>, <b>14</b><i>e</i>, <b>15</b><i>d</i>, and <b>15</b><i>e </i>may be formed simultaneously on a portion of the upper surfaces of layers <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>c</i>, <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>c</i>, <b>15</b><i>a</i>, and <b>15</b><i>c</i>, respectively. By independently inputting different electric currents to each micro-chip LED structures <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, and <b>15</b> through the electrode pads, the color and the light intensity of pixel <b>11</b> can be controlled. Therefore, a light emitting module <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> including a pixel <b>11</b> can have improved light efficiency and color reproduction.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a second pixel of a light emitting module consistent with principles of the present invention. In this embodiment, a pixel <b>11</b> in a light emitting module <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes three micro-chip LED structures <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, and <b>15</b> formed on a substrate <b>12</b>. Micro-chip LED structures <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> are stacked on substrate <b>12</b> with an intermediate layer <b>16</b> interposed between for substantially separating micro-chip LED structures <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>. Micro-chip LED structures <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> may emit a different color of light. Micro-chip LED structure <b>15</b> is also formed on substrate <b>12</b> and may be separate from micro-chip LED structures <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A process of forming pixel <b>11</b> is explained as follows. A lower layer <b>13</b><i>a </i>of micro-chip LED structure <b>13</b> is formed on substrate <b>12</b>. An upper layer <b>13</b><i>c </i>and a light-emitting active layer <b>13</b><i>b </i>are formed on the lower layer <b>13</b><i>a</i>.
