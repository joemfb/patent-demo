<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Embodiments of the present invention provide a collaborative visualization system, which integrates motion capture and virtual reality, along with kinematics and computer-aided design (CAD), for the purpose of, for example, virtual training on a task. A portable motion capture system tracks the movements of one or more trainers and records full-body motion capture data for one or more trainers performing one or more tasks. A virtual reality simulator receives the recorded motion capture data and animates scaled avatars within a three-dimensional virtual reality simulation responsive to recorded motion capture data. An immersive observation system displays the virtual reality simulation, including the animated avatars, as a three-dimensional image that appears to surround one or more trainees using one or more head mounted displays so that the one or more trainees can analyze the one or more tasks performed.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/022,185, by Dobbins et al., titled &#x201c;System and Program Product for Providing a Collaborative Immersive Environment and Related Methods&#x201d; filed Jan. 18, 2008, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to virtual reality and motion capture, and, more particularly, to systems and program products which allow persons to interact with real and artificial environments using motion capture.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various techniques and technologies exist which allow users to interact with or analyze their environment. For example, motion capture techniques are used in the fields of sports, medicine, and entertainment, especially video gaming and animation. In sports, for example, motion capture enables a golfer's swing to be digitally recorded for analysis. In medicine, orthopedic rehabilitation can employ motion capture to provide feedback to the patient, illustrating correct or incorrect techniques with the patient's movements during walking, for example. In animation, motion capture allows for an actor's movements and even facial expressions to be digitally recorded in a computer model. Later, animators use the actor's recorded motions as the basis for the motions of a computer-generated character. Likewise, video games use motion capture to facilitate the animation of life-like characters within the games.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Virtual reality technologies allow a user to interact with a computer-simulated environment. Most virtual reality environments rely on computer screens or stereoscopic displays and are primarily visual experiences. A popular example of virtual reality technology is a flight simulator video game, in which the player pilots a virtual aircraft in a computer-simulated environment.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Telepresence refers to technologies which allow the user to experience, or be present at, a remote location. For example, telepresence includes a remote video camera in which the user can control the pan, tilt, and zoom, if the display is of sufficient size and quality to allow the user to feel present at the remote location.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">None of these technologies alone provide a collaborative immersive environment for evaluating a design through interaction, virtual training on a task, and validating a simulation with a life video.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In view of the foregoing, embodiments of the present invention, for example, provide a collaborative visualization system, which integrates motion capture and virtual reality, along with kinematics and computer-aided design (CAD), for the purpose of, amongst others, evaluating a design. Embodiments of the present invention also provide, e.g., portable motion capture systems, which allow one or more persons to interact with real and artificial environments, and head mounted displays for evaluating a design, virtual training on a task, and validating a simulation with a real-world video, amongst others. Embodiments of the present invention further provide, for example, objects to be tracked by a motion capture system and incorporated into a virtual reality simulation. Embodiments of the collaborative visualization system can include, for example, an immersive environment with one or more simultaneous users, with one or more external observers, with real-time interactions and scaling, and with the ability to switch between a simulation and a telepresence view. An immersive environment can, for example, generate a three-dimensional or stereoscopic image which appears to surround the viewer. That is, the viewer is &#x201c;immersed&#x201d; in the artificial environment.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of the present invention include, for example, a virtual reality simulator. The virtual reality simulator can receive data from CAD designs and display a simulation constructed from the data to a user via, for example, a head mounted display, resulting in full-scale and stereoscopic images. The images can be, for example, so detailed that the user can read the wording on the working knobs and switches within the simulation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Embodiments of the present invention further include, for example, a motion capture system incorporated into the virtual reality simulator. The motion capture system, for example, can track the movements and interactions of a user (who is wearing a motion capture ensemble with flexible and adjustable level of detail, from just the head to a full body suit and gloves) within the virtual reality simulation so that the when the user's head rotates or tilts, the view of the simulation rendered in the head mounted display changes accordingly. The motion capture system, for example, can store the tracked movements and interactions of a user for later use, including, for example, training or design evaluation purposes. The motion capture system also can track the movements and interactions of multiple users within the virtual reality simulation such that the multiple users are represented by avatars in real time within the simulation. Thus, multiple users can simulate a coordinated activity within the simulation, such as performing routine maintenance on an aircraft, for example. In addition, the motion capture system, for example, can track the movements and interactions of objects, including tools and props used by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Embodiments of the present invention also include, for example, an immersive observation system where multiple observers can view, in real-time, the virtual reality simulation including the interactions of the avatars in a common, immersive environment so as to evaluate the CAD design. The immersive observation system can include a CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment), such as, a reconfigurable 8-foot-high by 10-foot-wide by 10-foot-long room with displays on three walls and the floor, where one or more observers view a common environment in an immersive and interactive way, including stereoscopic and full-scale images. Advantageously, using the CAVE, the designers of the CAD design can observe end-users interacting extensively with the proposed design in the simulator to analyze and evaluate the design without having to build expensive prototypes. For example, observers can view users within the simulation performing the routine maintenance operations on the aircraft. In addition, trainees can observe, for example, trainers performing various tasks by viewing avatars of the trainers responsive to recorded motion capture data.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the embodiments of the present invention, the virtual reality simulator can scale each avatar in real time. That is, a 5&#x2032; 4&#x2033; user within the simulation can be scaled in real-time to be a 6&#x2032; 2&#x2033; avatar within the simulation. The images rendered in the 5&#x2032; 4&#x2033; user's head mounted display will correspond to the perspective expected by someone 6&#x2032; 2&#x2033;. An observer of the simulation will see a 6&#x2032; 2&#x2033; avatar. Scaling may be accomplished by applying a ratio to each aspect of the data in the translation from motion capture data to simulation data. Alternately, scaling may be accomplished in real time by positioning the avatar's head, hands, and feet in the correct location to allow kinematics software to solve for the other joints. In addition, scaling may be accomplished in post processing, as opposed to in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to embodiments of the present invention, the virtual reality simulator can include interactions with the simulated environment. In one such example, the virtual reality simulator can include collision detection software to provide feedback within the simulation. If a user sticks his or her hand where the simulation indicates that a wall should be, for example a virtual collision is detected. The hand motion is set to either stop on the collision or allowed to disappear from the view of the user (because it is, after all, behind the wall), and the panel of the wall can be set to change color (or some other behavior) to provide feedback and indicate that a collision has occurred. In a preferred configuration, the wall turns red; similarly, if a knee &#x201c;collides&#x201d; with a toolbox in the simulation, the toolbox turns red. In exemplary configuration, the collision triggers a sound; the sound can be a directional sound indicating a direction of the collision with respect to the user or observer. Various types of sounds can further provide information regarding the collision, such as, severity or the objects involved in the collision. For example, a user hitting the user's head on part of an aircraft can result in a different sound than a object colliding with the floor. In addition, the simulation can alter its behavior based on detected collisions, by opening a door or panel, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, embodiments of the present invention can include a portable motion capture system for capturing tasks in the field. This system includes motion tracking markers (perhaps on a suit, body, or other apparel), a plurality of cameras installed on a tripod or clamped on a rigid structure so that cameras can track the movements of a user wearing the motion capture markers, and a computer to record the images from the camera. The portable motion capture system allows for a remote procedure, such as a field maintenance operation, be recorded. Because of the incorporated nature of the virtual reality simulator and the motion capture system provided by the embodiments of the present invention, the data from a field maintenance operation can later be studied in the virtual reality simulator for interactions with a new design or for real-time evaluation of, for example, an existing design or a sequence of operations on an existing design. Moreover, according to embodiments of the present invention, a portable motion capture system can be utilized for real-time design evaluation in the field, for presentation of a design, and for training at a remote location. Evaluation of a design can include, for example, evaluating a design with respect to an environment, an analysis of the ergonomics of the design, a study of tasks associated with the design, and other considerations as understood by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, embodiments of the present invention include methods of validating a simulation with real-world video using immersive technology. For example, according to an embodiment of such a method, a spherical camera captures real-world video, or a real-world still photograph, at a remote location. Later, the video or photograph is rendered in a head mounted display. A motion capture system collects the user's head rotation information, which is used to control the pan, tilt, and zoom of the video. Then the user can switch between displaying the real-world video and the simulation as a way of validating the simulation. In addition, the video can be displayed on a desktop or CAVE. As an example, using a spherical camera to capture the real-world images from the deck of an aircraft carrier can be used to validate a simulation of that environment.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Embodiments of the present invention include, for example, systems and associated methods of providing an immersive environment with multiple simultaneous users, with external observers, with real-time interactions and scaling, and with the ability to switch between a simulation and a telepresence view, as will be understood by those skilled in the art. Embodiments of the present invention provide improved approaches to evaluate designs without having to build prototypes and to train personnel without the need for prototypes or on location travel.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate embodiments of the invention. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the illustrated embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 10</figref>, embodiments of the present invention include an collaborative visualization system <b>20</b> which integrates motion capture and virtual reality technologies, along with kinematics and CAD, for the purpose of, amongst others, evaluating a design, virtual training on a task, and validating a simulation with a real-world video. In addition, embodiments of the present invention include, for example, immersive observation environments as well.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Embodiments of the present invention include, for example, a virtual reality simulator <b>58</b> to create the virtual reality environment. The virtual reality simulator can receive data from a CAD program and create a virtual reality simulation of the design projected to a user via a head mounted display <b>40</b>, as illustrated, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>5</b>. In addition, the simulation may be displayed via a desktop or a CAVE <b>44</b>. The virtual reality simulation is three-dimensional (3D) and allows a user to inspect, evaluate, and interact with the CAD design. The simulation environment is labeled immersive because the simulation is 3D and full-scale, and the user's view can rotate throughout the simulation so that and the user becomes immersed in the simulation.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Embodiments provide for evaluation of designs for aircraft, space systems, spacecraft, ships, and missile systems, which often utilize an extensive evaluation process traditionally requiring, for example, expensive mock-ups and prototypes. The extensive evaluation process can advantageously include ergonomic analysis and task analysis for operation and maintenance tasks, as understood by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the virtual reality software used includes ENVISION (D5) from DELMIA. As understood by those skilled in the art, this software provides a physics-based, 3D environment specifically for designing, verifying, and rapid prototyping of concept designs involving structures, mechanical systems, and humans. As understood by those skilled in the art, the software enhances system and subsystem level models with physics-based motion, virtual reality immersion, and ergonomic evaluation capabilities for highly accurate 3D simulation, analysis, and visualization. In addition, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, other software components used to create the virtual reality environment include: PolyWorks from InnovMetric Software Inc, a software tool used to convert point cloud data to polygons; NuGraf from Okino Computer Graphics, a polygon conversion and reduction tool; Deep Exploration or Deep Server from Right Hemisphere, a polygon conversion and reduction tool; and MS Visual Studio from Microsoft, a code development suite. According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the hardware supporting this software can includes: four Dell Precision Workstations 670, 16&#xd7;DVD-ROM, 48/32 CDRW, Dual 3.0 Ghz Xeon with 2 MB L2 Cache, 800 FSB 4 GB RAM, nVidia Quadro FX3400 256 MB, 136 GB HD. As understood by those skilled in the art, the virtual reality simulator can include a computer program product, stored in one or more tangible computer readable media and readable by a computer so that the computer program product operates to perform the various instructions when read by the computer as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>, according to an embodiment of the present invention, the motion capture system <b>30</b> includes, for example, users wearing bodysuits <b>32</b>, gloves <b>34</b>, and headgear <b>36</b> with markers <b>52</b> at known locations on the suit, such as the knee, the wrist, and the top of the shoulders. The motion capture system can further include real objects, or props, also having markers to be represented in the virtual reality simulator. Cameras <b>54</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, then digitally record the locations of the markers as the users move around and interact in the simulation, capturing a set of data. This motion capture data can then made available, in real time, to the virtual reality simulator <b>58</b> so that the users and their movements are modeled as avatars <b>56</b> within the simulation and so that feedback is provided to the users. An avatar is an electronic image that represents and is manipulated by, or driven by a computer user, as in a computer game or other virtual reality setting, typically being an incarnation in human form.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the motion capture system <b>30</b> includes up to twenty-four cameras <b>54</b> (e.g., 12 Eagle-i and 12 Hawk-i from Motion Analysis Corporation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>), for example, mounted on a truss <b>38</b> (e.g., L&#xd7;W&#xd7;H is 20&#x2032;&#xd7;15&#x2032;&#xd7;10&#x2032;) used to track up to six concurrent users wearing head-mounted displays <b>40</b>, gloves <b>34</b> (e.g., TALON Gloves from Motion Analysis Corporation), and body suits <b>32</b>. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the motion capture system <b>30</b> uses software from Motion Analysis Corporation called EVaRT V5.0.4 and includes the following plug-ins: Animation Plugins, RT2 Animation Plugins, Calcium 4, Talon Streaming 4, Talon Viewer 4, and EVaRT5. As understood by those skilled in the art, this software allows templates and props to be created and customized for tracking everything from physical mockups to full body person. In addition, VRSim's SimIO module can be used to multicast the data collected by EVaRT to be used by the simulation engine software ENVISION D5. As understood by those skilled in the art, embodiments can, for example, incorporate any number of cameras.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the virtual reality simulator can, for example, scale each avatar in real time. That is, a 5&#x2032; 4&#x2033; user within the simulation can be scaled in real-time to be a 6&#x2032; 2&#x2033; avatar within the simulation. The images rendered in the 5&#x2032; 4&#x2033; user's head mounted display will correspond to the perspective expected by someone 6&#x2032; 2&#x2033;. An observer of the simulation will see a 6&#x2032; 2&#x2033; avatar, and the avatar's posture will match that of the user. Scaling may be accomplished by applying a ratio to each aspect of the data in the translation from motion capture data to simulation data. Alternately, scaling may be accomplished by positioning the avatar's head, hands, and feet in the correct location to allow kinematics software to solve for the other joints. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates 4 avatars scaled to different sizes, all driven from the same user; hence, all have the same posture. Note also that scaling can be accomplished in post processing, as opposed to in real time. That is, for a remote training example, a user, i.e., a trainee, of a first size, e.g, 6&#x2032; 2&#x2033;, can be displayed an avatar of the first size, e.g, 6&#x2032; 2&#x2033;, responsive to motion capture data from a user, i.e., a trainer, of a second size different than the first size, e.g, 5&#x2032; 4&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>5</b>, according to embodiments of the present invention, a user experiences the virtual reality environment visually through a head-mounted display <b>40</b>, and each of the head mounted displays can have a different perspective of the virtual reality simulation. The head-mounted display <b>40</b> can include a stereo display helmet worn by users for immersive visualization of full-scale data. As understood by those skilled in the art, one type of head-mounted display <b>40</b>, the VR1280 from Virtual Research, has the ability to display at 1280&#xd7;1204 at 60 Hz in mono or stereo. As understood by those skilled in the art, a head mounted displays can include separate left-eye and right-eye displays with different images so that a user views an image in the head mounted display stereoscopically.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the software used to display the 3D scene can be based on OpenSceneGraph 3D graphics toolkit. MiniViz from VRSim is a viewer that allows the user to view a running ENVISION (D5) simulation. The viewer loads models in the environment and then references the ENVISION (D5) simulation for the positions of the models and tracked viewpoints.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Embodiments of the present invention provide computer workstations to support the head-mounted displays. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the hardware used to support four head-mounted displays includes: four Dell Precision Workstation 670, 16&#xd7;DVD-ROM 48/32 CDRW, Dual 3.0 Ghz Xeon with 2 MB L2 Cache, 800 FSB, 4 GB RAM, nVidia Quadro FX3400 256 MB, 136 GB HD. For convenience and as understood by those skilled in the art, a Hergo Easy Mount Mobile Computer Cart-Star Base <b>42</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, can be used to mount each set of equipment, including the computer, keyboard, mouse, head-mounted display <b>40</b>, Talon Gloves <b>34</b>, and a flat panel monitor from Hergo, according an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to embodiments of the present invention, the virtual reality simulator can include, for example, interactions with the simulated environment. In one such example, the virtual reality simulator can include collision detection software to provide feedback within the simulation. If a user sticks a hand where the simulation indicates that a wall should be, a virtual collision is detected. The hand can be stopped at the time of the collision or be allowed to disappear from the view of the user and the panel of the wall change color (or some other behavior) to provide feedback and indicate that a collision has occurred. In a preferred configuration, the wall turns red. Similarly, if a knee &#x201c;collides&#x201d; with a bomb in the simulation, the bomb turns red. In an exemplary embodiment, an appearance of the object is altered in response to the collision. In exemplary configuration, the collision triggers a sound; the sound can be a directional sound indicating a direction of the collision with respect to the user or observer. Various types of sounds can further provide information regarding the collision, such as, severity or the objects involved in the collision. For example, a user hitting the user's head on part of an aircraft can result in a different sound than a object colliding with the floor. In addition, the simulation can alter its behavior based on detected collisions, by opening a door or panel, for example. In addition, this collision detection feature can be used to facilitate the grabbing of a virtual object within the simulation, permitting the object to be moved or otherwise manipulated in the virtual environment. Collisions can also occur between avatars and between simulated objects, such as, between a simulated hand tool and simulated wall.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Embodiments of the present invention can also include, for example, an immersive observation environment as well. The observation environment allows designers to observe and interact with the virtual reality simulation including the avatars <b>56</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), which can be driven in real-time by motion capture data from the users. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the observation environments can include the CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment) <b>44</b>, a reconfigurable, e.g., 8-foot-high by 10-foot-wide by 10-foot-long room with displays on three walls and the floor, where one or more observers view a common environment in an immersive way, including stereoscopic and full-scale images. As understood by those skilled in the art, the CAVE <b>44</b> from Mechdyne displays a resolution of 1280&#xd7;1024 at 96 Hz. Therefore, designers and other observers can view in real-time detailed interaction of the users within the simulation. In an exemplary configuration, one wall of the CAVE <b>44</b> may be used to display all individual viewpoints with the other two walls and the floor of the CAVE <b>44</b> being used to display an overall view. In this configuration, an observer immersed in the simulation can view avatar <b>56</b> posture and the avatar view point simultaneously. Other available data, such as temperature, distance measurements, time, etc. whether visible or not, may be also be displayed on the one wall of the CAVE <b>44</b>, according to an exemplary configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the software used to display the 3D scene is based on OpenSceneGraph, a 3D graphics open source toolkit. Much like the stand alone viewer for the head-mounted display, the CAVE <b>44</b> can use the MiniViz software program. The projections of each screen, however, can be mapped using an Application Programmer's Interface (API) called CAVELib from Mechdyne. Also running the CAVE <b>44</b> are other programs, which can include: Vega, Vega Prime, and Ensight Gold, according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Embodiments of the present invention can also include head tracker <b>46</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) and wand hardware <b>48</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), to be used in the CAVE <b>44</b> to allow the observers to move around easily within the simulation. According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the InterSense IS-900 uses a combination of inertial and ultrasonic sensors to determine the positions of the head tracker and wand. The software running the head tracker and wand can include a program called Trackd 5.5 from VRCO. As understood by those skilled in the art, the Trackd application takes information from the head tracker and wand and makes that information available to either CAVELib or the ENVISION (D5) simulation. This tracked information is applied to correct the projections on the walls and the floor of the CAVE <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Embodiments of the present invention can also include, for example, an immersive environment with the ability to switch between a simulation and a telepresence view. The telepresence view is available through the CAVE <b>44</b>, a head mounted device <b>40</b>, or desktop display. The content for the telepresence view are gathered via a spherical camera <b>50</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>) at a remote location, such as, for example, the surface of an aircraft carrier. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the spherical camera <b>50</b> has a set of six digital cameras embedded into one device that captures 75% of a sphere. The dynamic scene can be displayed in the head mounted display <b>40</b> or the CAVE <b>44</b>, where the user can be immersed in real-world video information to help validate simulations. As understood by those skilled in the art, the Ladybug2 is a 4.7 MegaPixel video capture device using six 1024&#xd7;768 CCDs. According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the Ladybug2 from Point Grey Research comes with a software development environment Ladybug2 SDK and a tool called LadybugCap that allows content to be captured; this software produces spherical avi files for playback, as understood by those skilled in the art. In an exemplary embodiment, Ladybug3 can be used for better resolution but a lower frame rate.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As understood by those skilled in the art, the spherical camera <b>50</b> produces data files in 1 GB increments, which may be 2 seconds or 2 minutes. So, 30 seconds of video capture can turn into 15 files at 1 GB each. These files require translation into a viewable format. Other solutions use a video editor and paste the first viewable files together to form a single video file, in the process reducing the quality to produce a smaller, second level video file. In contrast, embodiments of the present invention read the first level video files into buffers and provide indexing, such as the first file, last, current, the file before the current and the file after the current. This allows the video group with many files to be played as if they were a single video file.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to an embodiment of the present invention, real-world objects can be scanned to create models for the virtual reality simulator. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the Creatform Handy Scan EXAscan can be employed. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a Leica HDS 3000 can be employed. The Leica HDS 3000 is a laser based device that scans equipment to quickly create high-fidelity 3D models where they do not yet exist. As understood by those skilled in the art, in practice, the true resolution of the scanner is &#xbc;&#x2033; of point accuracy for unmodeled data and &#x215b;&#x2033; of point accuracy for data modeled based on multiple points from a point cloud. According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the software used to capture the area, set the resolution, and register the point clouds together is Cyclone. Also used is PolyWorks to register the clouds and produce polygon geometry to be incorporated into the simulation. According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the hardware supporting the device can be a Dell Precision M70 Laptop, 1.86 GHz, 1 GB RAM, and Nvidia Quadro FX Go 1400.</p>
