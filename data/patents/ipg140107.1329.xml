<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from Japanese Patent Applications No. 2010-104770, filed on Apr. 30, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a cap device provided in a liquid jetting apparatus and a liquid jetting apparatus provided with the cap device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A liquid jetting apparatus having a liquid jetting head for jetting liquid often includes a cap device having a cap member capable of covering a liquid jetting surface of the liquid jetting head. For example, in an ink-jet type printer (a liquid jetting apparatus) described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2007-196612 (FIG. 4), there is provided a cap device including: a recessed-shaped cap member capable of covering a liquid jetting surface of a liquid jetting head and easily tiling; a suction pump sucking and discharging liquid jetted into an inner space of the cap member from the liquid jetting head; and a discharge tube connecting the cap member and the suction pump. In the above cap device, the cap member covers the liquid jetting surface and the suction pump is driven, and thereby the inner space of the cap member is sucked to have a negative pressure. Thereby, air bubbles and thickened liquid are ejected from the liquid jetting head and the liquid received in the inner space of the cap member is discharged through the discharge tube.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the discharge tube connected to the cap member is routed or drawn through a narrow space to the suction pump, along with miniaturization of the cap device, for example. Then, the discharge tube connected to the cap member is curved to form an arched shape expanding toward outer side, thereby coming into contact with peripheral members to generate reaction force. The reaction force locally acts on a connection portion of the discharge tube to the cap member. Then, the cap member to which the discharge tube is connected tilts. Then, there is a risk for causing such problems that, for example, the liquid discharged into the inner space of the cap member by the suction pump spills, and that a gap is generated when the cap member comes into close contact with the liquid jetting surface.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Then, an object of the present invention is to provide a cap device preventing a cap member from tilting and a liquid jetting apparatus provided with the same.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a cap device which covers a jetting surface of a liquid jetting head to recover a jetting performance of the liquid jetting head, the cap device including:</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">a cap unit which is tiltable in a plane direction of the jetting surface and which comes into close contact with the jetting surface of the liquid jetting head;</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">a flexible discharge tube of which one end is connected to the cap unit, which communicates with an inner space defined by the cap unit and the jetting surface under a condition that the cap unit comes into close contact with the jetting surface, and through which a liquid in the inner space is discharged; and</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">a fixing mechanism which fixes a portion, of the discharge tube, other than the one end to the cap unit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Moreover, the cap unit may include: a cap member which comes into close contact with the jetting surface, the cap member having a bottom wall portion facing the jetting surface and an annular lip provided to project from the bottom wall portion toward a jetting surface; and</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">a cap holder which holds the bottom wall portion of the cap member and which is tiltable in the plane direction of the jetting surface, and</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">the fixing mechanism may fix a portion, of the discharge tube, other than the one end to the cap holder.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the cap device of the present invention, for example, the discharge tube has the one end thereof connected to the cap holder, and the portion different from a connection portion is fixed by the fixing mechanism on the cap holder so that displacement is restricted. In the above case, it becomes difficult that the discharge tube having the one end thereof connected to the cap holder comes into contact with a peripheral member to generate a reaction force. Further, in the case when the discharge tube is fixed to the cap holder by the fixing mechanism, the cap holder and the discharge tube are united, and a repulsive force to be generated when the discharge tube is bent is reduced. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the cap member held by the cap holder from tilting.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a liquid jetting apparatus which jets two kinds of liquids, including:</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">a jetting head having a jetting surface on which a first nozzle and a second nozzle through which the two types of liquids are jetted, respectively, are formed; and</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">the cap device according to the first aspect of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The discharge tube has the one end thereof connected to the cap holder and has the portion different from the connection portion fixed by the fixing mechanism on the cap holder. Thereby, it becomes difficult that the discharge tube having the one end thereof connected to the cap holder comes into contact with the peripheral member to thereby generate a reaction force. Further, the discharge tube is fixed to the cap holder by the fixing mechanism, so that the cap holder and the discharge tube are united and a repulsive force to be generated when the discharge tube is bent is reduced. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the cap member held by the cap holder from tilting.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The ink-jet head <b>3</b> includes a piezoelectric actuator and a channel unit in which the plurality of nozzles <b>35</b>, and ink channels are formed. In the channel unit, the inks supplied from the four sub-tanks <b>4</b><i>a </i>to <b>4</b><i>d </i>are sent to the nozzles <b>35</b> through the ink channels.

Further, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the illustration of a drive motor <b>42</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is omitted. The cap device <b>7</b> performs a suction purge in which inks are forcibly discharged from the nozzles <b>35</b> of the ink-jet head <b>3</b> to recover the ink jetting performance of the ink-jet head <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, within a moving range of the carriage <b>2</b> in the scanning direction, the cap device <b>7</b> is disposed at a position (a maintenance position) more outside than a printing zone facing the recording paper P (on the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The cap device <b>7</b> is provided with a cap member <b>12</b> capable of coming into close contact with the ink jetting surface <b>38</b> of the ink-jet head <b>3</b>, a cap holder <b>60</b> holding the cap member <b>12</b> from below thereof, a cap lift holder <b>69</b> holding the cap holder <b>60</b> from below thereof, a suction pump <b>14</b>, a switching mechanism <b>15</b> switching a connection destination of the suction pump <b>14</b>, two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> connecting the cap member <b>12</b> and the switching mechanism <b>15</b>, a cap drive mechanism <b>40</b> driving the cap holder <b>60</b> and the cap member <b>12</b> to move up and down together with the cap lift holder <b>69</b>, and so on.

<p id="h-0009" num="0000">&#x3c;Structure of Cap Member&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">First, the cap member <b>12</b> will be explained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B, the cap member <b>12</b> has a rectangular bottom wall <b>50</b>, an annular lip <b>51</b> provided upright along an edge of the bottom wall <b>50</b>, and a partition plate <b>52</b> provided upright from the bottom wall <b>50</b> and partitioning an inner space of a recessed portion defined by the annular lip <b>51</b> and the bottom wall <b>50</b> into two sub spaces. The cap member <b>12</b> is integrally molded of an elastic member such as rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The partition plate <b>52</b> extends along the paper feeding direction to couple between mid-portions of portions, of the lip <b>51</b>, extending in the scanning direction. Then, the partition plate <b>52</b> partitions the recessed portion that is demarcated by the annular lip <b>51</b> and the bottom wall <b>50</b> and is formed in a rectangular shape of which upper portion is opened into two recessed portions <b>57</b>, <b>58</b>. Thereby, the inner space of the cap member <b>12</b> is divided into two of an inner space <b>53</b> for the black ink and an inner space <b>54</b> for the three color inks (cyan, magenta, and yellow).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The recessed portion <b>57</b> is positioned to the left of the recessed portion <b>58</b>. A bottom surface of the rectangular recessed portion <b>57</b> faces the nozzles <b>35</b> for jetting the black ink, when the ink jet head <b>3</b> moves to the maintenance position. A bottom surface of the rectangular recessed portion <b>58</b> faces the nozzles <b>35</b> for jetting the three color inks, when the ink-jet head <b>3</b> moves to the maintenance position. The single nozzle row corresponds to the nozzles <b>35</b> for jetting the black ink, in the meantime, the three nozzle rows correspond to the nozzles <b>35</b> for jetting the three color inks. Thus, a length of the recessed portion <b>58</b> in the scanning direction is longer than that of the recessed portion <b>57</b> in the scanning direction so that the recessed portion <b>58</b> can cover the corresponding nozzle rows entirely. Then, a through hole <b>55</b> passing through the bottom wall <b>50</b> in a thickness direction is formed in a rear end portion of the bottom wall <b>50</b> composing the recessed portion <b>57</b>. Further, a through hole <b>56</b> passing through the bottom wall <b>50</b> in the thickness direction is formed in a rear end portion of the bottom wall <b>50</b> composing the recessed portion <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">&#x3c;Structure of Cap Holder&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Next, the cap holder <b>60</b> will be explained. The cap holder <b>60</b> is formed of a member such as synthetic resin that is more rigid than that of the cap member <b>12</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref>, both end portions of the cap holder <b>60</b> in the paper feeding direction are formed to project upward, and a recessed portion is formed at a center portion of the cap holder <b>60</b>. The cap member <b>12</b> is placed on the recessed portion of the cap holder <b>60</b> to be held from below thereof. Further, the cap holder <b>60</b> is held by the cap lift holder <b>69</b> via a spring <b>68</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>). The cap lift holder <b>69</b> is coupled to a later-described cap slide cam <b>41</b> of the cap drive mechanism <b>40</b> to be capable of tilting in a horizontal plane direction. In other words, the cap lift holder <b>69</b> is coupled to the cap slide cam <b>41</b> of the cap drive mechanism so as to be tiltable in any direction of the horizontal plane direction. Here, the horizontal plane direction is a plane direction of a plane including the paper feeding direction and the scanning direction, and is coincident with a plane direction of horizontal surfaces <b>41</b><i>a</i>, <b>41</b><i>c </i>of the later-described cap slide cam <b>41</b>. A projecting portion <b>61</b> projecting downward and a connection hole <b>63</b> passing through a center axis of the projecting portion <b>61</b> are formed at a position, of the cap holder <b>60</b>, overlapping the through hole <b>55</b> in the bottom wall <b>50</b> of the cap member <b>12</b> in a plane view. A projecting portion <b>62</b> projecting downward and a connection hole <b>64</b> passing through an axis core of the projecting portion <b>62</b> are formed at a position, of the cap holder <b>60</b>, overlapping the through hole <b>56</b> in the bottom wall <b>50</b> of the cap member <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Further, two fixing members <b>65</b>, <b>66</b> (fixing mechanisms) fixing the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> to the cap holder <b>60</b> are formed on a rear end portion of a lower surface, of the cap holder <b>60</b>, facing the cap slide cam <b>41</b>. The fixing member <b>65</b> is disposed adjacently to the projecting portion <b>61</b> in the paper feeding direction. Further, the fixing member <b>65</b> has two sidewalls <b>65</b><i>a</i>, <b>65</b><i>b </i>disposed apart to sandwich the projecting portion <b>61</b> in the scanning direction, a first projection <b>65</b><i>c </i>projecting to the right (a sidewall <b>65</b><i>a </i>side) from a lower end portion of the sidewall <b>65</b><i>b</i>, an upper wall <b>65</b><i>d </i>extending rearward on the two sidewalls <b>65</b><i>a</i>, <b>65</b><i>b</i>, a supporting wall <b>65</b><i>e </i>projecting rearward from an upper end portion of the upper wall <b>65</b><i>d </i>and bent downward, and a second projection <b>65</b><i>f </i>projecting rearward from a lower end portion of the upper wall <b>65</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The fixing member <b>66</b> is disposed to be adjacent to the fixing member <b>65</b> in the scanning direction and adjacent to the projecting portion <b>62</b> in the paper feeding direction.

Then, an upper end portion of the supporting wall <b>65</b><i>e </i>and an upper end portion of the supporting wall <b>66</b><i>d </i>are the same in height, and the lower end portion of the upper wall <b>65</b><i>d </i>and an upper end portion of the sidewall <b>66</b><i>b </i>are the same in height.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The discharge tube <b>80</b> has flexibility. One end of the discharge tube <b>80</b> is connected to the projecting portion <b>61</b> on the cap holder <b>60</b> communicating with the through hole <b>55</b> formed in the recessed portion <b>57</b> for the black ink of the cap member <b>12</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The other end of the discharge tube <b>80</b> is connected to a later-described Bk port <b>95</b><i>b </i>of the switching mechanism <b>15</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). The discharge tube <b>81</b> has flexibility. One end of the discharge tube <b>81</b> is connected to the projecting portion <b>62</b> on the cap holder <b>60</b> communicating with the through hole <b>56</b> formed in the recessed portion <b>58</b> for the color inks of the cap member <b>12</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The other end of the discharge tube <b>81</b> is connected to a later-described Co port <b>95</b><i>a </i>of the switching mechanism <b>15</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). A structure of the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> which are drawn from the cap holder <b>60</b> to the switching mechanism <b>15</b> by using the two fixing members <b>65</b>, <b>66</b> will be described later.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">&#x3c;Structure of Cap Drive Mechanism&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Next, the cap drive mechanism <b>40</b> will be explained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the cap drive mechanism <b>40</b> has the cap slide cam <b>41</b> (a slide member) formed movably in the paper feeding direction to drive the cap holder <b>60</b> to move up and down, the drive motor <b>42</b> (a drive mechanism) moving the cap slide cam <b>41</b> in the paper feeding direction, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7A</figref>, the cap slide cam <b>41</b> is disposed under the cap lift holder <b>69</b> holding the cap holder <b>60</b>, and has the horizontal surface <b>41</b><i>a </i>extending in the paper feeding direction, an inclined surface <b>41</b><i>b </i>continuing to the horizontal surface <b>41</b><i>a </i>and extending rearward in the paper feeding direction to be inclined downward, and the horizontal surface <b>41</b><i>c </i>continuing to the inclined surface <b>41</b><i>b </i>and extending in the paper feeding direction. Then, a lower surface of the cap lift holder <b>69</b> slidably comes into contact with one of the horizontal surface <b>41</b><i>a</i>, the inclined surface <b>41</b><i>b</i>, and the horizontal surface <b>41</b><i>c </i>of the cap slide cam <b>41</b>, and a height position of the cap lift holder <b>69</b> is determined depending on the height of the surface of the cap lift holder <b>69</b> in contact with the cap slide cam <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, a rack gear <b>43</b> extending rearward in the paper feeding direction and having a length longer than a total length of the horizontal surface <b>41</b><i>a</i>, the inclined surface <b>41</b><i>b</i>, and the horizontal surface <b>41</b><i>c </i>in the paper feeding direction is provided at a rear end portion of the cap slide cam <b>41</b> forming the horizontal surface <b>41</b><i>c</i>, and a pinion gear <b>44</b> coupled to the drive motor <b>42</b> is engaged with the rack gear <b>43</b>. The drive motor <b>42</b> is adjacently disposed at the rear of the cap lift holder <b>69</b> in the paper feeding direction (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Then, the pinion gear <b>44</b> is rotated by the drive motor <b>42</b>, and along with the rotation of the pinion gear <b>44</b>, the cap slide cam <b>41</b> moves in the paper feeding direction below the cap member <b>12</b> together with the rack gear <b>43</b> engaging with the pinion gear <b>44</b>. Then, the cap lift holder <b>69</b> slides over the horizontal surface <b>41</b><i>a</i>, the inclined surface <b>41</b><i>b</i>, and the horizontal surface <b>41</b><i>c </i>of the cap slide cam <b>41</b> by the above movement of the cap slide cam <b>41</b>. With the slide, the cap lift holder <b>69</b> moves up and down corresponding to the height position of the horizontal surface <b>41</b><i>a</i>, the inclined surface <b>41</b><i>b</i>, and the horizontal surface <b>41</b><i>c</i>. Incidentally, in the above case, the position of the cap lift holder <b>69</b> in a horizontal direction does not change.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">&#x3c;Separating/Approaching Operation of Cap Member with Respect to Ink Jetting Surface&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Next, a separating/approaching operation of the cap member <b>12</b> with respect to the ink jetting surface <b>38</b> of the ink-jet head <b>3</b> will be explained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, before the suction purge is started, the cap slide cam <b>41</b> is positioned at a front end portion in the paper feeding direction. At this time, the lower surface of the cap lift holder <b>69</b> is in a state of being in contact with the horizontal surface <b>41</b><i>c </i>of the cap slide cam <b>41</b> to be moved down, and the cap member <b>12</b> is positioned at the retraction position separated from the ink jetting surface <b>38</b> of the ink-jet head <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Then, when the cap slide cam <b>41</b> moves rearward in the paper feeding direction by the drive motor <b>42</b>, the lower surface of the cap lift holder <b>69</b> slides on the horizontal surface <b>41</b><i>c </i>of the cap slide cam <b>41</b>, and then moves up while sliding on the inclined surface <b>41</b><i>b</i>. Then, as the cap lift holder <b>69</b> moves up, the cap member <b>12</b> also moves up from the retraction position. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, when the cap slide cam <b>41</b> moves further rearward and the cap member <b>12</b> moves to the capping position, the cap slide cam <b>41</b> stops. Then, the cap lift holder <b>69</b> moves to the position where the lower surface of the cap lift holder <b>69</b> comes into contact with the horizontal surface <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the cap slide cam <b>41</b>, and the cap member <b>12</b> comes into close contact with the ink jetting surface <b>38</b> of the ink-jet head <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Incidentally, the position of the cap slide cam <b>41</b> in the paper feeding direction can be detected by the number of rotations of the drive motor <b>42</b>. Thereby, the position of the cap slide cam <b>41</b> in the paper feeding direction is controlled, thereby enabling the cap member <b>12</b> to be driven in a direction approaching to/separating from the ink jetting surface <b>38</b> between the retraction position and the capping position.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">&#x3c;Structure of Switching Mechanism&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Next, the switching mechanism <b>15</b> will be explained. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are shown by two-dot chain lines. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 8</figref>, the switching mechanism <b>15</b> selectively switches the connection destination of the suction pump <b>14</b> to the inner space <b>53</b> of the recessed portion <b>57</b> for the black ink or the inner space <b>54</b> of the recessed portion <b>58</b> for the color inks. The switching mechanism <b>15</b> is disposed below the cap lift holder <b>69</b> with the cap slide cam <b>41</b> intervening therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The switching mechanism <b>15</b> has a suction port <b>94</b> formed at a center of a bottom wall of a cover <b>92</b> in a bottomed cylindrical shape, a plurality of ports <b>95</b> formed on a peripheral wail of the cover <b>92</b>, and a switching member <b>91</b> housed inside the cover <b>92</b> and having a branch groove <b>93</b> that extends in a radial direction from the center formed therein. The suction port <b>94</b> is connected to the suction pump <b>14</b> via a not-illustrated tube. The ports <b>95</b> include the Bk port <b>95</b><i>b </i>connected to the discharge tube <b>80</b> to communicate with the inner space <b>53</b> for the black ink of the cap member <b>12</b>, and the Co port <b>95</b><i>a </i>connected to the discharge tube <b>81</b> to communicate with the inner space <b>54</b> for the color inks of the cap member <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Then, depending on a rotation angle of the switching member <b>91</b>, the switching mechanism <b>15</b> is formed to enable the suction pump <b>14</b> to communicate with the inner space <b>53</b> for the black ink of the cap member <b>12</b> through the Bk port <b>95</b><i>b </i>and the discharge tube <b>80</b>, and to enable the suction pump <b>14</b> to communicate with the inner space <b>54</b> for the color inks of the cap member <b>12</b> through the Co port <b>95</b><i>a </i>and the discharge tube <b>81</b>. The rotation angle of the switching member <b>91</b> can be determined or obtained by the number of rotations of a not-illustrated motor for driving the switching member <b>91</b>. Therefore, when the number of rotations of the motor is controlled, the switching member <b>91</b> can be rotated only at an arbitrary rotation angle. Here, the switching mechanism <b>15</b> functions as an opening/closing valve coupled to the other ends of the discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b>. That is, the switching mechanism <b>15</b> opens the other end of one of the discharge tubes <b>80</b> and <b>81</b> so that the suction pump <b>14</b> and one of the inner spaces <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> communicate, and closes the other end of one of the discharge tube <b>80</b> and <b>81</b> so that the suction pump <b>14</b> and one of the inner space <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> do not communicate.</p>

Then, the discharge tube <b>80</b> having the one end thereof connected to the connection hole <b>63</b> and extending in a vertical direction is bent rearward and is routed or drawn between the two sidewalls <b>65</b><i>a </i>and <b>65</b><i>b </i>of the fixing member <b>65</b>. Further, the discharge tube <b>80</b> is fixed by the first projection <b>65</b><i>c </i>from therebelow while being sandwiched between the two sidewalls <b>65</b><i>a </i>and <b>65</b><i>b</i>. That is, at the portion of the discharge tube <b>80</b> sandwiched between the two sidewalls <b>65</b><i>a </i>and <b>65</b><i>b</i>, displacement in the scanning direction is restricted and downward displacement is restricted. Thereby, the discharge tube <b>80</b> is fixed by the fixing member <b>65</b> in the vicinity of a connection portion to the cap holder <b>60</b>. Thus, it is prevented that the discharge tube <b>80</b> hangs down due to its own weight to come into contact with the cap slide can <b>41</b>.</p>

In this manner, the discharge tube <b>81</b> is routed to the left between the cap holder <b>60</b> and the cap drive mechanism <b>40</b> on the discharge tube <b>80</b>, and is connected to the Co port <b>95</b><i>a </i>of the switching mechanism <b>15</b> positioned therebelow while avoiding the cap slide cam <b>41</b>. Incidentally, the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> are drawn to the left to be connected to the switching mechanism <b>15</b> in order to lengthen the discharge tube <b>81</b> than the discharge tube <b>80</b>. Then, the discharge tube <b>81</b> is fixed at points (two points) more than the discharge tube <b>80</b> because the discharge tube <b>81</b> is longer than the discharge tube <b>80</b>, resulting that the displacements are firmly restricted. Further, as compared with the discharge tube <b>80</b>, the discharge tube <b>81</b> is also fixed at the portion away from the connection portion connected to the cap holder <b>60</b>. Thus, the portion in which the cap holder <b>60</b> and the discharge tube <b>81</b> are united or integrated is lengthened and a repulsive force to be generated when the discharge tube <b>81</b> is bent is reduced.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">&#x3c;Suction Purge&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Next, the suction purge will be explained. First, the carriage <b>2</b> is moved to the maintenance position to face the ink jetting surface <b>38</b> of the ink-jet head <b>3</b> to the cap member <b>12</b>. In the above state, the pinion gear <b>44</b> is driven by the drive motor <b>42</b> to move the cap slide cam <b>41</b> to the capping position from the retraction position. Then, the cap member <b>12</b> comes into close contact with the ink jetting surface <b>38</b> of the ink-jet head <b>3</b> to cover the nozzles <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Then, the switching member <b>91</b> is rotated to make the inner space <b>53</b> for the black ink between the cap member <b>12</b> and the ink jetting surface <b>38</b> communicate with the suction pump <b>14</b> via the discharge tube <b>80</b>. When a suction operation of the suction pump <b>14</b> is performed in the above state, an air in the above inner space <b>53</b> is sucked and the pressure reduces, and the inks are sucked and discharged into the inner space <b>53</b> from the nozzles <b>35</b> for the black ink. This makes it possible to discharge thickened inks in the nozzles <b>35</b> for the black ink and air bubbles mixed in the ink channel in the ink-jet head <b>3</b> from the nozzles <b>35</b> together with the inks to recover the ink jetting performance of the ink-jet head <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Thereafter, driving of the suction pump <b>14</b> is stopped to stop sucking the inks from the nozzles <b>35</b>. In a state of the ink being received in the inner space <b>53</b>, the cap member <b>12</b> is moved to the retraction position to be separated from the ink jetting surface <b>38</b>, thereby opening the sealed inner space <b>53</b>. In the above state, the suction pump <b>14</b> is driven again to discharge the ink sucked from the nozzles <b>35</b> for the black ink and received in the inner space <b>53</b> through the discharge tube <b>80</b> (what is called an idle suction operation).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Further, the suction purge for the color inks is performed, first, in the state where the cap member <b>12</b> comes into close contact with the ink jetting surface <b>38</b> of the ink-jet head <b>3</b> to cover the nozzles <b>35</b>, the switching member <b>91</b> is rotated to make the inner space <b>54</b> for the color inks between the cap member <b>12</b> and the ink jetting surface <b>38</b> communicate with the suction pump <b>14</b> via the discharge tube <b>81</b>. When the suction operation of the suction pump <b>14</b> is performed in the above state, the inks are sucked and discharged into the inner space <b>54</b> from the nozzles <b>35</b> for the color ink. This makes it possible to discharge thickened inks in the nozzles <b>35</b> for the color ink and air bubbles mixed in the ink channels in the ink-jet head <b>3</b> from the nozzles <b>35</b> together with the inks to recover the ink jetting performance of the ink-jet head <b>3</b>. Thereafter, similarly to the above-described case of the black ink, the idle suction operation is performed, and thereby the suction pump <b>14</b> is driven again to discharge the ink sucked from the nozzles <b>35</b> for the color ink and received in the inner space <b>54</b> through the discharge tube <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to the cap device <b>7</b> in this embodiment, the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> have the one ends thereof connected to the cap holder <b>60</b> and are fixed by the two fixing members <b>65</b>, <b>66</b> on the cap holder <b>60</b> at the positions different from the connection portions so that the displacements are restricted. Thereby, it becomes difficult that the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> having the one ends thereof connected to the cap holder <b>60</b> come into contact with the peripheral member such as the cap drive mechanism <b>40</b> to thereby generate reaction forces, when the discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> are routed to the switching mechanism <b>15</b>. Further, when the cap member <b>12</b> is driven to move up and down by the cap drive mechanism <b>40</b>, for example, the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> tend to bend with the movement to be displaced. However, the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> are fixed by the two fixing members <b>65</b>, <b>66</b> on the cap holder <b>60</b>, so that the cap holder <b>60</b> and the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> are united and repulsive forces to be generated when the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> are bent are reduced. In this manner, reducing the reaction forces and repulsive forces of the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> makes it possible to prevent the cap member <b>12</b> held by the cap holder <b>60</b> from tilting by an effect of the reaction forces and repulsive forces. Thereby, it is possible to prevent the inks received in the two inner spaces <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> of the cap member <b>12</b> by the suction purge from spilling and to prevent a gap from being generated when the cap member <b>12</b> is moved to the capping position to come into close contact with the ink jetting surface <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Further, the discharge tube <b>81</b> for the color inks is bent upward to be fixed by the first projection <b>66</b><i>c </i>and the supporting wall <b>66</b><i>d </i>formed on the fixing member <b>66</b>, so that the displacement of the discharge tube <b>81</b> in the vertical direction is restricted. Further, the discharge tube <b>81</b> is bent to the left to be fixed by the upper wall <b>65</b><i>d </i>and the supporting wall <b>65</b><i>e </i>formed on the fixing member <b>65</b>, so that the displacement of the discharge tube <b>81</b> in the horizontal direction is restricted. In this manner, the discharge tube <b>81</b> is fixed at the two points, so that the discharge tube <b>81</b> can be firmly fixed. Further, it is possible to route the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> between the cap member <b>12</b> and the drive motor <b>42</b> of the cap drive mechanism <b>40</b> while preventing the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> from coming into contact with the drive motor <b>42</b> of the cap drive mechanism <b>40</b> adjacent to the cap holder <b>60</b>, and to route the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> downward to avoid the cap slide cam <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Further, when the suction purge is performed at the time of inspection before the printer <b>1</b> is shipped, a large amount of inks are discharged into the inner space <b>54</b> of the cap member <b>12</b> as compared with the inner space <b>53</b> because the number of the nozzles <b>35</b> for the color inks is greater than that of the nozzles <b>35</b> for the black ink. Here, at the time of shipment of the printer <b>1</b>, there is a risk that the color inks jetted at the inspection are not discharged to remain in the inner space <b>54</b>, and that the color inks reach the switching mechanism <b>15</b> via the discharge tube <b>81</b> to then flow backward into the inner space <b>54</b>. Then, there is a risk that, for example, inks in which the color inks are mixed with a different color ink in the switching mechanism <b>15</b>, or the color inks are mixed with grease coated on the switching member <b>91</b> in the switching mechanism <b>15</b> for reducing rotation friction, flow backward to adhere to the ink jetting surface <b>38</b>. Thus, the discharge tube <b>81</b> connected to the inner space <b>54</b> into which a large amount of color inks are jetted is lengthened to increase the volume in the discharge tube <b>81</b>, and thereby it is possible to prevent the color inks jetted into the inner space <b>54</b> from reaching the switching mechanism <b>15</b> via the discharge tube <b>81</b>. Further, the discharge tube <b>81</b> is longer than the discharge tube <b>80</b> and easily hangs down due to its own weight. However, the discharge tube <b>81</b> is routed on the discharge tube <b>80</b>. Thus, even if the discharge tube <b>81</b> hangs down, it is possible to hold the discharge tube <b>81</b> by the discharge tube <b>80</b> from below.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Further, on the cap holder <b>60</b>, the two projecting portions <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> to which the one ends of the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> are connected, and the two fixing members <b>65</b>, <b>66</b> fixing the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> are disposed in a row in the paper feeding direction. The two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> are not routed in the vertical direction but are routed along the paper feeding direction to be fixed by the two fixing members <b>65</b>, <b>66</b>, so that it is possible to reduce the printer <b>1</b> in size in terms of the vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Further, at the time of shipment, in order to obtain stability against sway or vibration by conveyance, the printer <b>1</b> is placed vertically in a manner to have the rear (lower side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) positioned at the bottom so that the heavy member such as the drive motor <b>42</b> of the cap drive mechanism <b>40</b> comes to the lower side. At this time, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the cap member <b>12</b> is disposed vertically so that the bottom wall <b>50</b> becomes parallel to the vertical direction. At this time, since the discharge tubes <b>80</b> (<b>81</b>) are connected to the rear of the cap holder <b>60</b>, most of the inks that are jetted to be received in the two inner spaces <b>53</b> (<b>54</b>) of the cap member <b>12</b> at the time of inspection are to flow into the discharge tubes <b>80</b> (<b>81</b>). Thus, the inks received in the inner spaces <b>53</b> (<b>54</b>) of the cap member <b>12</b> disposed vertically do not come into contact with the regions, of the ink jetting surface <b>38</b>, having the nozzles <b>35</b> formed thereon. This can prevent nozzle clogging ascribable to the fact that the inks received in the inner spaces <b>53</b> (<b>54</b>) are dried to be condensed, and the condensed inks adhere to the nozzles <b>35</b>. At this time, the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> are connected to the rear (a drive motor <b>42</b> side) of the cap holder <b>60</b>. Thus, in the case when the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> are routed between the cap member <b>12</b> and the drive motor <b>42</b>, there is a risk that curvatures decrease and repulsive forces increase. However, it is possible to reduce the repulsive forces by the two fixing members <b>65</b>, <b>66</b>, and to prevent that the discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> come into contact with the drive motor <b>42</b> to thereby generate reaction forces.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Next, modified embodiments in which the above-described embodiment is variously modified will be explained. However, components having the structures similar to those of the above-described embodiment will be denoted by the same reference numerals and symbols, and explanation thereof will be omitted when appropriate. Incidentally, these modified embodiments may also be implemented in appropriate combination within a range of the present teaching. Further, the above-described embodiment and the later-described modified embodiments are merely examples of the present teaching, and the present teaching is not interpreted to be limited to them.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The lip <b>51</b>, of the cap member <b>12</b>, abutting on the ink jetting surface <b>38</b> is preferably formed of an elastic member such as rubber, but the bottom wall <b>50</b> is not necessarily an elastic member in particular, and may also be a plate made of synthetic resin or metal different from the member forming the lip <b>51</b>. In the above case, as long as the connection portions and the fixed portions of the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> are provided on the same member, it may also be designed that the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> are directly connected to the bottom wall <b>50</b> and the two fixing members <b>65</b>, <b>66</b> fixing the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> are provided on the bottom wall <b>50</b>, without the cap holder <b>60</b> being provided. In the above case, the cap member <b>12</b> corresponds to the cap unit of the present teaching.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Further, in this embodiment, the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> are fixed by the two fixing members <b>65</b>, <b>66</b> from outer peripheral sides of the bent discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b>, but it may also be designed that an outer peripheral surface of the cap holder <b>60</b> and the two discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> are fixed by an adhesive or friction absorption to fix the bent discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> from inner peripheral sides thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, it may also be designed that the drive motor <b>42</b> of the cap drive mechanism <b>40</b> adjacent to the cap holder <b>60</b> is used not only as the drive motor for moving the cap member <b>12</b> up and down but also as a drive motor for the suction pump <b>14</b> and drive motors for other members by switching a plurality of gears coupled to the drive motor, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further, a cover covering the cap slide cam <b>41</b> and the like may also be provided. For example, in the case when the cover is formed to be attached to the printer <b>1</b> from above of the cap slide cam <b>41</b>, the cover comes into contact with the discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> when the cover is attached. Thereby, reaction forces are generated in the discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b>, and the cap member <b>12</b> sometimes tilts. If the tilt of the cap member <b>12</b> is such that it cannot be visually recognized, a manufacturer does not notice the tilt of the cap member <b>12</b>, and there is a risk that the printer <b>1</b> is completed as a product in a state of the cap member <b>12</b> being on the tilt. In the above case, the cap member <b>12</b> cannot come into close contact with the ink jetting surface <b>38</b> in the posture of covering the ink jetting surface <b>38</b> entirely, and in the worst case, a gap is generated between the cap member <b>12</b> and the ink jetting surface <b>38</b>. However, the discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> are directly connected to the cap holder <b>60</b>, so that the reaction forces do not act on the discharge tubes <b>80</b>, <b>81</b>, resulting that it is possible to prevent the cap member <b>12</b> from tilting.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the above-explained embodiments, the present invention is applied to the cap device provided in the serial-type printer, but an application object of the present invention may also be a cap device provided in a line-type printer. Further, it is possible to apply the present invention not only to the cap device provided in the ink-jet type printer but also to cap devices provided in various liquid jetting apparatuses jetting various types of liquids onto objects depending on their use.</p>
