<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Systems and methods for storing radioactive materials that afford adequate ventilation of the cavity in which the radioactive materials are stored. In one aspect, the invention is a method of storing radioactive materials comprising: a) positioning a system comprising a shell forming a cavity and at least one inlet ventilation duct extending from an inlet to an outlet at a bottom portion of the cavity in a below grade hole so that the inlet of the inlet ventilation duct is above grade and the outlet of the inlet ventilation duct into the cavity is below grade; b) introducing engineered till into the hole to circumferentially surround the shell; c) lowering a canister containing radioactive materials into the cavity; and d) subsequent to the canister being lowered into the cavity, placing a lid on the shell.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to the field of storing radioactive materials, and specifically to systems and methods for storing radioactive materials, such as spent nuclear fuel, in ventilated vertical modules.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the operation of nuclear reactors, it is customary to remove fuel assemblies after their energy has been depleted down to a predetermined level. Upon removal, this spent nuclear fuel is still highly radioactive and produces considerable heat, requiring that great care be taken in its packaging, transporting, and storing. In order to protect the environment from radiation exposure, spent nuclear fuel is first placed in a canister. The loaded canister is then transported and stored in large cylindrical containers called casks. A transfer cask is used to transport spent nuclear fuel from location to location while a storage cask is used to store spent nuclear fuel for a determined period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a typical nuclear power plant, an open empty canister is first placed in an open transfer cask. The transfer cask and empty canister are then submerged in a pool of water. Spent nuclear fuel is loaded into the canister while the canister and transfer cask remain submerged in the pool of water. Once fully loaded with spent nuclear fuel, a lid is typically placed atop the canister while in the pool. The transfer cask and canister are then removed from the pool of water, the lid of the canister is welded thereon and a lid is installed on the transfer cask. The canister is then properly dewatered and filled with inert gas. The transfer cask (which is holding the loaded canister) is then transported to a location where a storage cask is located. The loaded canister is then transferred from the transfer cask to the storage cask for long term storage. During transfer from the transfer cask to the storage cask, it is imperative that the loaded canister is not exposed to the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One type of storage cask is a ventilated vertical overpack &#x201c;VVO&#x201d;). A VVO is a massive structure made principally from steel and concrete and is used to store a canister loaded with spent nuclear fuel. VVOs stand above ground and are typically cylindrical in shape and extremely heavy, weighing over 150 tons and often having a height greater than 16 feet. VVOs typically have a flat bottom, a cylindrical body having a cavity to receive a canister of spent nuclear fuel, and a removable top lid.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In using a VVO to store spent nuclear fuel, a canister loaded with spent nuclear fuel is placed in the cavity of the cylindrical body of the VVO. Because the spent nuclear fuel is still producing a considerable amount of heat when it is placed in the VVO for storage, it is necessary that this heat energy have a means to escape from the VVO cavity. This heat energy is removed from the outside surface of the canister by ventilating the VVO cavity. In ventilating the VVO cavity, cool air enters the VVO chamber through bottom ventilation ducts, flows upward past the loaded canister, and exits the VVO at an elevated temperature through top ventilation ducts. The bottom and top ventilation ducts of existing VVOs are located circumferentially near the bottom and top of the VVO's cylindrical body respectively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">While it is necessary that the VVO cavity be vented so that heat can escape from the canister, it is also imperative that the VVO provide adequate radiation shielding and that the spent nuclear fuel not be directly exposed to the external environment. The inlet duct located near the bottom of the overpack is a particularly vulnerable source of radiation exposure to security and surveillance personnel who, in order to monitor the loaded overpacks, must place themselves in close vicinity of the ducts for short durations.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additionally, when a canister loaded with spent nuclear fuel is transferred from a transfer cask to a storage VVO, the transfer cask is stacked atop the storage VVO so that the canister can be lowered into the storage VVO's cavity. Most casks are very large structures and can weigh up to 250,000 lbs. and have a height of 16 ft. or more. Stacking a transfer cask atop a storage VVO/cask requires a lot of space, a large overhead crane, and possibly a restraint system for stabilization. Often, such space is not available inside a nuclear power plant. Finally, above ground storage VVOs stand at least 16 feet above ground, thus, presenting a sizable target of attack to a terrorist.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a traditional prior art VVO <b>2</b>. Prior art VVO <b>2</b> comprises flat bottom <b>17</b>, cylindrical body <b>12</b>, and lid <b>14</b>. Lid <b>14</b> is secured to cylindrical body <b>12</b> by bolts <b>18</b>. Bolts <b>18</b> serve to restrain separation of lid <b>14</b> from body <b>12</b> if prior art VVO <b>2</b> were to tip over.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, underground VVO <b>20</b> is illustrated according to a first embodiment of the present invention. Underground VVO <b>20</b> is a vertical, ventilated dry spent fuel storage system that is fully compatible with 100 ton and 125 ton transfer casks for spent fuel canister transfer operations. Underground VVO <b>20</b> can be modified/designed to be compatible with any size or style transfer cask. Underground VVO <b>20</b> is designed to accept spent fuel canisters for storage at an Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation &#x201c;ISFSI&#x201d;) in lieu of above ground overpacks (such as prior art VVO <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). All spent fuel canister types engineered for storage in free-standing and anchored overpack models can be stored in underground VVO <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As used herein the term &#x201c;canister&#x201d; broadly includes any spent fuel containment apparatus, including, without limitation, multi-purpose canisters and thermally conductive casks. For example, in some areas of the world, spent fuel is transferred and stored in metal casks having a honeycomb grid-work/basket built directly into the metal cask. Such casks and similar containment apparatus qualify as canisters, as that term is used herein, and can be used in conjunction with underground VVO <b>20</b> as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Underground VVO <b>20</b> comprises body <b>21</b>, base <b>22</b>, and removable lid <b>41</b>. Body <b>21</b> is constructed of concrete, but can be constructed of other suitable materials. Body <b>21</b> is rectangular in shape but can be any shape, such as for example, cylindrical, conical, spherical, semi-spherical, triangular, or irregular in shape. A portion of body <b>21</b> is positioned below grade so that only top portion <b>24</b> protrudes above grade level <b>23</b>. Preferably, at least a major portion of the height of body <b>21</b> is positioned below grade. The exact height which top portion <b>24</b> of body <b>21</b> extends above ground level <b>23</b> can be varied greatly and will depend on a multitude of design considerations, such as canister dimensions, radioactivity levels of the spent fuel to be stored, ISFSI space limitations, geographic location considering susceptibility to missile-type and ground attacks, geographic location considering frequency of and susceptibility to natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis, etc.), environmental conditions (such as temperature, precipitation levels), and/or ground water levels. Preferably, top portion <b>24</b> of body <b>21</b> is less than approximately 42 inches above ground level <b>23</b>, and most preferably approximately 6 to 36 inches above ground level <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, it may even be preferable that the entire height of body <b>21</b> be below grade (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8D and 8E</figref>). As will be discussed in more detail below, when the entire height of body is below grade, only the top surface of the body will be exposed to the ambient air above grade.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, body <b>21</b> forms cylindrical cavity <b>26</b> therein (best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). While cavity <b>26</b> is cylindrical in shape, cavity <b>26</b> is not limited to any specific size, shape, and/or depth and can be designed to receive and store almost any shape of canister without departing from the spirit of the invention. While not necessary to practice the invention, it is preferred that the horizontal cross-sectional size and shape of cavity <b>26</b> be designed to generally correspond to the horizontal cross-sectional size and shape of the canister-type that is to be used in conjunction with that particular underground VVO. More specifically, it is desirable that the size and shape of cavity <b>26</b> be designed so that when a spent fuel canister (such as canister <b>70</b>) is positioned in cavity <b>26</b> for storage, a small clearance exists between the outer side walls of the canister and the side walls of cavity <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Designing cavity <b>26</b> so that a small clearance is formed between the side walls of the stored canister and the side walls of cavity <b>26</b> limits the degree the canister can move within the cavity during a catastrophic event, thereby minimizing damage to the canister and the cavity walls and prohibiting the canister from tipping over within the cavity. This small clearance also facilitates flow of the heated air during spent nuclear fuel cooling. The exact size of the clearance can be controlled/designed to achieve the desired fluid flow dynamics and heat transfer capabilities for any given situation. In some embodiments, for example, the clearance may be 1 to 3 inches. A small clearance also reduces radiation streaming.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Two inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> are provided in body <b>21</b> for providing inlet ventilation to the bottom of cavity <b>26</b>. Inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> are elongated substantially S-shaped passageways extending from above grade inlets <b>27</b> to below grade outlets <b>28</b>. Above grade inlets <b>27</b> are located on opposing side walls of top portion <b>24</b> of body <b>21</b> and open to the ambient air above ground level <b>23</b>. As use herein, the terms ambient air, ambient atmosphere, or outside atmosphere, refer to the atmosphere/air external to the underground VVO, and include the natural outside environment and spaces within buildings, tents, caves, tunnels, or other man-made or natural enclosures.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Below grade outlets <b>28</b> open into cavity <b>26</b> at or near its bottom at a position below the ground level <b>23</b>. Thus, inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> provide a passageway for the inlet of ambient air to the bottom of cavity <b>26</b>, despite the bottom of cavity <b>26</b> being well below grade. Vent screens <b>31</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) are provided to cover above grade inlets <b>27</b> so that objects and other debris can not enter and block the passageways of inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b>. As a result of the elongated S-shape of inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b>, above grade inlets <b>27</b> cease to be a location of elevated dose rate that is common in free-standing above ground VVOs. While below grade outlets <b>28</b> are illustrated as being opening near the bottom of the walls of cavity <b>26</b>, below grade outlets <b>28</b> can be located in the floor of cavity <b>26</b> is desired. This can be accomplished by appropriately reshaping inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> and forming an opening through bottom plate <b>38</b> and into cavity <b>26</b>. In such an embodiment, base <b>22</b> can be considered part of the body <b>21</b> through which the inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> extend.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Above grade inlets <b>27</b> are located in the side walls of body <b>21</b> at an elevation of about 10 inches above ground level <b>23</b>. However, the elevation of above grade inlets <b>27</b> is not limiting of the present invention. The inlets <b>27</b> can be located at any desired elevation above the ground level, including level/flush therewith, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8D and 8E</figref>. Elevating above grade inlets <b>27</b> substantially above the ground level <b>23</b> helps reduce the likelihood that rain or flood water will enter the cavity <b>26</b>. It is noted that for IFSI's in flood zones, floodwater can possibly rise more than a foot above ground level and, thus, enter cavity <b>26</b> via inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b>. However, as discussed below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, underground VVO <b>20</b> is specifically designed to deal with the worst flood conditions in a safe and effective manner.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">While above grade inlets <b>27</b> are preferably located in the side walls of body <b>21</b>, the above grade inlets are not limited to such a location and, if desired, can be located anywhere on the body, including for example in the top surface (or any other surface) of the body. Further examples of possible locations for above grade inlets <b>27</b> on body <b>21</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> have a rectangular cross-sectional area of about 6 inches by 40 inches. However, any cross-sectional shape and/or size can be used, such as for example, round, elliptical, triangular, hexagonal, octagonal, etc. Additionally, while the shape of inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> is an elongated substantially S-shaped passageway, a multitude of shapes can be used that still achieve acceptable dose rates at the above grade inlets <b>27</b>. For example, rather than an elongated S-shape, the inlet ventilation duct can extend from the above grade inlet to the below grade outlet in a zig-zag shape, a tilted linear shape, a general L-shape, or any angular, linear, or curved combination. The exact shape, size, and cross-sectional configuration of the inlet ventilation duct is a matter of design preference and will be dictated by such factors, such as thickness of the body of the VVO, radioactivity level of the spent fuel being stored in the cavity, temperature of the spent fuel canister, desired fluid flow dynamics through the ducts, and placement of the above grade inlet vents on the body (i.e., whether the above grade inlet vents/opening are located on the side walls of the body, its top surface, or some other surface of the body). Further examples of possible shapes for inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> are preferably formed by a low carbon steel liner. However, inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> can be made of any material or can be mere passageways formed into concrete body <b>21</b> without a lining.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, cavity <b>26</b> is formed by thick steel shell <b>34</b> and bottom plate <b>38</b>. Shell <b>34</b>, bottom plate <b>38</b>, and inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> are preferably made of a metal, such as steel, preferably low carbon steel, but can be made of other materials, such as stainless steel, aluminum, aluminum-alloys, plastics, and the like. Inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> are seal joined to shell <b>34</b> and bottom plate <b>38</b> to form an integral/unitary structure <b>100</b> (shown in isolation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) that is hermetically sealed to the ingress of below grade water and other fluids. In the case of weldable metals, this seal joining may comprise welding or the use of gaskets. Thus, the only way water or other fluids can enter cavity <b>26</b> is through above grade inlets <b>27</b> or outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b> in lid <b>41</b>. As will be discussed below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-15</figref>, the integral structure itself is an invention and can be used to store spent nuclear fuel without the use of body <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">An appropriate preservative, such as a coal tar epoxy or the like, is applied to the exposed surfaces of shell <b>34</b>, bottom plate <b>38</b>, and inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> in order to ensure sealing, to decrease decay of the materials, and to protect against fire. A suitable coal tar epoxy is produced by Carboline Company out of St. Louis, Mo. under the tradename Bitumastic 300M. In some embodiments of the underground VVO of the present invention, a bottom plate will not be used.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Concrete body <b>21</b> surrounds shell <b>34</b> and inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b>. Body <b>21</b> provides non-structural protection for shell <b>34</b> and inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b>. Insulation <b>37</b> is provided at the interface between shell <b>34</b> and concrete body <b>21</b> and at the interface between inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> and concrete body <b>21</b>. Insulation <b>37</b> is provided to prevent excessive transmission of heat decay from spent fuel canister <b>70</b> to concrete body <b>21</b>, thus maintaining the bulk temperature of the concrete within FSAR limits. Insulating shell <b>34</b> and inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> from concrete body <b>21</b> also serves to minimize the heat-up of the incoming cooling air before it enters cavity <b>26</b>. Suitable forms of insulation include, without limitation, blankets of alumina-silica fire clay (Kaowool Blanket), oxides of alimuna and silica (Kaowool S Blanket), alumina-silica-zirconia fiber (Cerablanket), and alumina-silica-chromia (Cerachrome Blanket).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Insulating inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> from the heat load of spent fuel in cavity <b>26</b> is very important in facilitating and maintaining adequate ventilation/cooling of the spent fuel. The insulating process can be achieved in a variety of ways, none of which are limiting of the present invention. For example, in addition to adding an insulating material to the exterior of the shell <b>34</b> and inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b>, it is also possible to insulate inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> by providing a gap in concrete body <b>21</b> between cavity <b>26</b> and inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b>. The gap may be filled with an inert gas or air if desired. Moreover, irrespective of the means used to provide the insulating effect, the insulating means is not limited to being positioned on the outside surfaces of shell <b>34</b> or inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> but can be positioned anywhere between cavity <b>26</b> and inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Body <b>21</b>, along with the integral steel unit formed by bottom plate <b>38</b>, shell <b>34</b>, and ventilation ducts <b>25</b>, are placed atop base <b>22</b>. Base <b>22</b> is a reinforced concrete slab designed to satisfy the load combinations of recognized industry standards, such as, without limitation, ACI-349. Base <b>22</b> is rectangular in shape but can take on any shape necessary to support body <b>21</b>, such as round, elliptical, triangular, hexagonal; octagonal, irregularly shaped, etc. While using a base is preferable to achieve adequate load supporting requirements, situations can arise where using such a base may be unnecessary.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, underground VVO <b>20</b> has a removable ventilated lid <b>41</b>. Lid <b>41</b> is positioned atop body <b>21</b>, thereby substantially enclosing cavity <b>26</b> so that radiation does not escape through the top of cavity <b>26</b> when canister <b>70</b> is positioned in cavity <b>26</b>. When lid <b>41</b> is placed atop body <b>21</b> and spent fuel canister <b>70</b> is positioned in cavity <b>26</b>, outlet air plenum <b>36</b> is formed between the top surface of canister <b>70</b> and lid <b>41</b>. Outlet air plenum <b>36</b> is preferably a minimum of 3 inches in height, but can be any desired height. The exact height will be dictated by design considerations such as desired fluid flow dynamics, canister height, VVO height, the depth of the cavity, canister heat load, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Lid <b>41</b> has four outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b>. Outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b> form a passageway from the top of cavity <b>26</b> (specifically from outlet air plenum <b>36</b>) to the ambient air so that heated air can escape from cavity <b>26</b>. Outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b> are horizontal passageways that extend through side wall <b>30</b> of lid <b>41</b>. However, the outlet ventilation ducts can be any shape or orientation, such as vertical, L-shaped, S-shaped, angular, curved, etc. Because outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b> are located within lid <b>41</b> itself, the total height of body <b>21</b> is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Lid <b>41</b> comprises a roof <b>35</b> made of concrete. Roof <b>35</b> provides radiation shielding so that radiation does not escape from the top of cavity <b>26</b>. Side wall <b>30</b> of lid <b>41</b> is an annular ring. Outlet air plenum <b>36</b> helps facilitate the removal of heated air via outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b>. In order to minimize the heated air exiting outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b> from being siphoned back into inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b>, outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b> are azimuthally and circumferentially separated from inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Ventilated lid <b>41</b> also comprises shear ring <b>47</b>. When lid <b>41</b> is placed atop body <b>21</b>, shear ring <b>47</b> protrudes into cavity <b>26</b>, thus, providing enormous shear resistance against lateral forces from earthquakes, impactive missiles, or other projectiles. Lid <b>41</b> is secured to body <b>21</b> with bolts (not shown) that extend therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">While not illustrated, it is preferable that duct photon attenuators be inserted into all of inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> and/or outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b> of underground VVO <b>20</b>, irrespective of shape and/or size. A suitable duct photon attenuator is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,519,307, Bongrazio, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an embodiment of a lid <b>50</b> that can be used in underground VVO <b>20</b> is illustrated. Lid <b>50</b> contains similar design aspects as lid <b>41</b> and is illustrated to more fully disclose the aforementioned lid design aspects. Lid <b>50</b> has four horizontal outlet ventilation ducts <b>51</b> in side wall <b>52</b>. Shear ring <b>54</b> is provided on the bottom of lid <b>50</b> to fit into cavity <b>26</b>. Bolts <b>18</b> are used to secure lid <b>50</b> to tapped holes in the top of body <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">While the outlet ventilation ducts are illustrated as being located within the lid <b>50</b> of underground VVO <b>20</b>, the present invention is not so limited. For example, outlet ventilation ducts can be located in the body of the underground VVO at a location above grade. This concept is illustrated if <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8E</figref>. If the outlet ventilation ducts are located in the body of the underground VVO, the openings of the outlet ventilation ducts to the ambient air can be located in the body's side walls, on its top surface, or in any other surface. Similar to when the outlet ventilation ducts are located in the lid, the outlet ventilation ducts can take on a variety of shapes and/or configurations when located in the body of the underground VVO itself. As with the inlet ventilation ducts, the outlet ventilation ducts are preferably formed by a low carbon steel liner, but can be made of any material or can be mere passageways formed into concrete body <b>21</b> or lid <b>41</b> without a lining. In all embodiments of the present invention which have both inlet and outlet ventilation ducts, it is preferred that the outlet ventilation duct openings be azimuthally and circumferentially separated from the inlets of the inlet ventilation ducts to minimize interaction between inlet and outlet air streams. There is no limitation on the shape and style of lid used in conjunction with underground VVO <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, soil <b>29</b> surrounds body <b>21</b> for almost the entirety of its height. When spent fuel canister <b>70</b> is positioned in cavity <b>26</b>, at least a major portion, if not the entirety, of canister <b>70</b> is below grade. Preferably, the entire height of canister <b>70</b> is below grade in order to take full advantage of the shielding effect of the soil <b>29</b>. Thus, soil <b>29</b> provides a degree of radiation shielding for spent fuel stored in underground VVO <b>20</b> that can not be achieved in above-ground overpacks. Underground VVO <b>20</b> is unobtrusive in appearance and there is no danger of underground VVO <b>20</b> tipping over. Additionally, underground VVO <b>20</b> does not have to contend with soil-structure interaction effects that magnify the free-field acceleration and potentially challenge the stability of an above ground free-standing overpack.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, area VI-VI of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is illustrated in detail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates design aspects that are important to ensure that underground VVO <b>20</b> can successfully withstand flood conditions without adverse impact. Support blocks <b>32</b> are provided on the bottom surface (formed by plate <b>38</b>) of cavity <b>26</b> so that canister <b>70</b> can be placed thereon. Support blocks <b>32</b> are circumferentially spaced from one another (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). When canister <b>70</b> is loaded into cavity <b>26</b> for storage, the bottom surface <b>71</b> of canister <b>70</b> rests on support blocks <b>32</b>, forming an inlet air plenum <b>33</b> between the bottom surface <b>71</b> of the canister <b>70</b> and the bottom surface/floor of cavity <b>26</b>. Support blocks <b>32</b> are made of low carbon steel and are preferably welded to the bottom surface of the cavity <b>26</b>. Other suitable materials of construction include, without limitation, reinforced-concrete, stainless steel, and other metal alloys.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Support blocks <b>32</b> also serve an energy/impact absorbing function. Support blocks <b>32</b> are preferably of a honeycomb grid style, such as those manufactured by Hexcel Corp., out of California, U.S.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Support blocks <b>32</b> are specifically designed so that bottom surface <b>71</b> of canister <b>70</b> is lower than top <b>74</b> of below grade outlets <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b>. Preferably, support blocks <b>32</b> are designed so that bottom surface <b>71</b> of canister <b>70</b> is about 2 to 6 inches below top <b>74</b> of below grade outlets <b>28</b>. However, any desired height differential can be achieved through proper design. By supporting canister <b>70</b> in cavity <b>26</b> so that its bottom surface <b>71</b> is lower than top <b>74</b> of below grade outlets <b>28</b>, underground VVO <b>20</b> will provide adequate cooling to canister <b>70</b> under even the most adverse flood condition, which is colloquially referred to as a &#x201c;smart flood.&#x201d; A &#x201c;smart flood&#x201d; is one that floods the VVO so that the water level is just high enough to block airflow though the inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> completely. In other words, the water level is just even with top <b>74</b> of the below grade outlets <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">However, underground VVO <b>20</b> can adequately deal with the &#x201c;smart flood&#x201d; condition because the bottom surface <b>71</b> of the canister <b>70</b> is situated at a height that is below top <b>74</b> of below grade outlets <b>28</b>. As a result, if a &#x201c;smart flood&#x201d; was to occur, the bottom of the canister <b>70</b> will be in contact with (i.e. submerged in) the water. Because the heat removal efficacy of water is over 100 times that of air, a wet bottom is all that is needed to effectively remove heat and keep the canister <b>70</b> cool. The deeper the submergence of canister <b>70</b> in the water, the cooler canister <b>70</b> and its contained fuel will remain. As the water in cavity <b>26</b> is heated by the bottom of canister <b>70</b>, the water evaporates, rises through cavity <b>26</b> via annular space <b>60</b>, and exits cavity <b>26</b> via the outlet ventilation ducts. Thus, the canister cooling action changes from ventilation air-cooling to evaporative water cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In one embodiment, below grade outlets <b>28</b> of inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> will be 8 inches high by 40 inches wide and inlet air plenum <b>33</b> is 6 inches high. This provides a height differential of 2 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">It should be noted that the height differential design aspect of underground VVO <b>20</b> that is detailed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> can also be incorporated into free-standing above ground casks and VVOs to deal with &#x201c;smart flood&#x201d; conditions, independent of the other features of underground VVO <b>20</b>. Thus, this concept is an independent inventive aspect of the present application. When incorporated into above ground VVOs, the inlet ventilation ducts should be designed so that radiation can not escape to the surrounding environment from the inlet ventilation ducts. This is a threat because the canister will be below the inlet duct's opening into the storage cavity. In this embodiment, the inlet ventilation ducts will be shaped so that a line of sight does not exist to the canister in the storage cavity from the ambient air. For example, the inlet ventilation ducts can comprise a portion that is L-shaped, angled, S-shaped, or curved.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Moreover, while the height differential design aspect of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is achieved using support blocks <b>32</b>, it is also possible to practice this aspect of the invention without support blocks <b>32</b>. In such embodiments, canister <b>70</b> will be positioned in cavity <b>26</b> and rest directly on the floor of cavity <b>26</b>. However, the use of support blocks <b>32</b> is desirable because of the creation of air inlet plenum <b>33</b> and because the use of support blocks <b>32</b> helps prohibit debris and dirt from getting trapped at the bottom of cavity <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8E</figref>, examples of alternative configurations of the outlet ventilation ducts and the inlet ventilation ducts in an underground VVO according to the present invention are schematically illustrated. Much of the detail, and some structure, has been omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8E</figref> for simplicity with the understanding that any or all of the details discussed above with respect to underground VVO <b>20</b> can be incorporated therein. Like numbers are used to identify like parts with the exception of alphabetical suffixes being used for each embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">It should be noted that, in addition to the configurations of the inlet ventilation ducts and the outlet ventilation ducts illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8E</figref>, a multitude of other configurations, combinations, and modifications can be incorporated into the present invention. Some of these details are discussed above. Additionally, the outlet ventilation duct configurations of any of the illustrated embodiments can be combined with any of the illustrated inlet ventilation duct configurations, and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In all embodiments of the present invention, it is desirable that the heated air exiting the outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b> be prohibited from being siphoned back into the inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> (i.e., keeping the warm outlet air stream from mixing with the cool inlet air stream). This can be accomplished by in a number of ways, including: (1) the positioning/placement of the inlets <b>27</b> on the underground VVO <b>20</b> with respect to the outlets of the outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b>; providing a plate <b>98</b> or other structure that segregates the air streams (as exemplified in FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>C-<b>8</b>E); and/or (3) extending the inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> to a position away from the outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As a result of the heat emanating from canister <b>70</b>, cool air from the ambient is siphoned into inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> and into the bottom of cavity <b>26</b>. This cool air is then warmed by the heat from the spent fuel in canister <b>70</b>, rises in cavity <b>26</b> via annular space <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) around canister <b>70</b>, and then exits cavity <b>26</b> as heated air via outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b> in lid <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, ISFIs can be designed to employ any number of underground VVOs <b>20</b> (or integral structures <b>100</b>) and can be expanded in number easily to meet growing needs. Although underground VVOs <b>20</b> are closely spaced, the design permits any cavity to be independently accessed by cask crawler <b>90</b> with ease. The subterranean configuration of underground VVOs <b>20</b> greatly reduce the height of the stack structures created during loading/transfer procedures where transfer cask <b>80</b> is positioned atop underground VVO <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">An embodiment of a method of using underground VVO <b>20</b> to store spent nuclear fuel canister <b>70</b> will now be discussed in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>. Upon being removed from a spent fuel pool and treated for dry storage, spent fuel canister <b>70</b> is positioned in transfer cask <b>80</b>. Transfer cask is <b>80</b> is carried by cask crawler <b>90</b> to a desired underground VVO <b>20</b> for storage. While a cask crawler is illustrated, any suitable means of transporting transfer cask <b>80</b> to a position above underground VVO <b>20</b> can be used. For example, any suitable type of load-handling device, such as without limitation, a gantry crane, overhead crane, or other crane device can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In preparing the desired underground VVO <b>20</b> to receive canister <b>70</b>, lid <b>41</b> is removed from body <b>21</b> so that cavity <b>26</b> is open. Cask crawler <b>90</b> positions transfer cask <b>80</b> atop underground VVO <b>20</b>. After transfer cask is properly secured to the top of underground VVO <b>20</b>, a bottom plate of transfer cask <b>80</b> is removed. If necessary, a suitable mating device can be used to secure the connection of transfer cask <b>80</b> to underground VVO <b>20</b> and to remove the bottom plate of transfer cask <b>80</b> to an unobtrusive position. Such mating devices are well known in the art and are often used in canister transfer procedures. Canister <b>70</b> is then lowered by cask crawler <b>90</b> from transfer cask <b>80</b> into cavity <b>26</b> of underground VVO <b>20</b> until the bottom surface of canister <b>70</b> contacts and rests atop support blocks <b>32</b>, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">When resting on support blocks <b>32</b>, a major portion of the canister's height is below grade. Most preferably, the entirety of canister <b>70</b> is below grade when in its storage position. Once canister <b>70</b> is positioned and resting in cavity <b>26</b>, lid <b>41</b> is placed over cavity <b>26</b>, substantially enclosing cavity <b>26</b>. Lid <b>41</b> is oriented atop body <b>21</b> so that shear ring <b>47</b> protrudes into cavity <b>26</b> and outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b> are azimuthally and circumferentially separated from inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> on body <b>21</b>. Lid <b>41</b> is then secured to body <b>21</b> with bolts. As a result of the heat emanating from canister <b>70</b>, cool air from the ambient is siphoned into inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> and into the bottom of cavity <b>26</b>. This cool air is then warmed by the heat from the spent fuel in canister <b>70</b>, rises in cavity <b>26</b> via annular space <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) around canister <b>70</b>, and then exits cavity <b>26</b> as heated air via outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b> in lid <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an integral structure <b>100</b> for storing spent nuclear fuel is illustrated according to an embodiment of the invention.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Shell <b>34</b>, bottom plate <b>38</b>, and inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> are preferably formed of a metal, such as low carbon steel. Other suitable materials include, without limitation, stainless steel, aluminum, aluminum-alloys, plastics, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b>, bottom plate <b>38</b>, and shell <b>34</b> are seal welded at all junctures to form a unitary structure that is hermetically sealed to the ingress water and other fluids.

The height of shell <b>34</b> is designed so that a canister of spent fuel can be positioned within cavity <b>26</b> so as not to protrude from top opening <b>101</b>. There is no limitation on the height to which shell <b>34</b> can be constructed. The exact height of shell <b>34</b> will be dictated by the height of the spent fuel canister to be stored therein, the desired depth (below grade) at which the canister is to be stored, whether the outlet ventilation ducts are in the lid or integrated into the shell <b>34</b>, and/or the desired height of the outlet air plenum that is to exist during canister storage.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a hole <b>200</b> is first dug into the ground <b>210</b> at a desired position within the ISFSI and at a desired depth.

Moreover, the desired engineered fill can be supplied to the hole by any means feasible, including manually, dumping, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, soil <b>301</b> is supplied to hole <b>200</b> until soil <b>301</b> surrounds integral structure <b>100</b> and fills hole <b>200</b> to a level where soil <b>301</b> is approximately equal to ground level <b>212</b>. Soil <b>301</b> is in direct contact with the exterior surfaces of integral structure <b>100</b> that are below grade. When hole <b>200</b> is filled with soil <b>301</b>, inlets <b>27</b> of inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> are above grade. Shell <b>34</b> also protrudes from soil <b>301</b> so that opening <b>101</b> is slightly above grade. Therefore, because integral structure <b>100</b> is hermetically sealed at all junctures, below grade liquids and soil can not enter into cavity <b>26</b> or inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b>. Support blocks <b>32</b> are provided at the bottom of cavity <b>26</b> for supporting a stored spent fuel canister.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, once hole <b>200</b> is adequately filled with soil <b>301</b>, a canister <b>70</b> of spent fuel <b>70</b> is loaded into cavity <b>26</b> of integral structure <b>100</b>. The canister loading sequence is discussed in greater detail above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Canister <b>70</b> is lowered into cavity <b>26</b> until it rests on support blocks <b>32</b>. As discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, support blocks <b>32</b> and outlets <b>28</b> of integral structure <b>100</b> are specially designed to deal with &#x201c;smart flood&#x201d; conditions. Canister <b>70</b> rests on support blocks <b>32</b>, forming an inlet air plenum <b>33</b> between the bottom of canister <b>70</b> and the floor of cavity <b>26</b> (which in this case is bottom plate <b>38</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">When canister <b>70</b> is supported on support blocks <b>32</b>, the entire height of canister <b>70</b> is below ground level <b>212</b>. This maximizes use of the ground's radiation shielding capabilities. The depth at which canister <b>70</b> is below ground level <b>212</b> can be varied by increasing or decreasing the depth of hole <b>200</b>. Once canister <b>70</b> is supported in cavity <b>26</b>, lid <b>41</b> is placed atop shell <b>34</b>, thereby closing opening <b>101</b> and prohibiting radiation from escaping upwards from cavity <b>26</b>. Outlet air plenum <b>36</b> is formed between the bottom surface of lid <b>41</b> and the top of canister <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Lid <b>41</b> comprises outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b>. Outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b> form passageways from outlet air plenum <b>36</b>, through lid <b>41</b>, to the ambient air above ground level <b>212</b>. Outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b> do not have to be provided in lid <b>41</b>, but can be formed as part of the integral structure <b>100</b> if desired. This will be discussed in greater detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, when integral structure <b>100</b> is used to store spent nuclear fuel canister <b>70</b>, the radiation shielding effect of the sub-grade is utilized while adequately facilitating cooling of canister <b>70</b>. The cooling of canister <b>70</b> is facilitated by cool air entering inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> via above grade inlets <b>27</b>. The cool air travels through inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b> until it enters cavity <b>26</b> at or near inlet air plenum <b>33</b> via below grade outlets <b>28</b>. Once the cool air is within cavity <b>26</b> it is warmed by the heat emanating from canister <b>70</b>. As the air is warmed, it travels upward along the outer surface of canister <b>70</b> via annular space <b>60</b> until the air enters outlet air plenum <b>36</b>. As the air travels upward through annular space <b>60</b> it continues to remove heat from canister <b>70</b>. The warmed air then exits cavity <b>26</b> via outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b> and enters the ambient air. This natural convective cooling flow repeats continuously until the canister <b>70</b> is adequately cooled.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, an alternative embodiment of an integral structure <b>200</b> is illustrated. Integral structure <b>200</b> is used to store a spent fuel canister in manner similar to that of integral structure <b>100</b> discussed above. While much of the structure is identical to that of integral structure <b>100</b>, integral structure <b>200</b> further comprises outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b> seal welded directly to shell <b>34</b>. The outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b> can be formed out of any of the materials discussed above with respect to the inlet ventilation ducts <b>25</b>. As a result of the outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b> being part of integral structure <b>200</b>, lid <b>41</b> can be free of such ducts. The cooling process of canister <b>70</b> remains the same.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates an integral structure <b>300</b> according to another aspect of the present invention. Integral structure <b>300</b> is similar in many respect to that of integral structures <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> in its design and functioning. However, integral structure <b>300</b> is specifically designed to store canisters <b>70</b> holding low heat spent fuel. When a canister <b>70</b> is giving off low heat, for example in the magnitude of 2-3 kW, it is not necessary to supply inlet ventilation ducts to supply cool air to cavity <b>26</b>. Therefore, the inlet ventilation ducts are omitted from integral structure <b>300</b>. Integral structure <b>300</b> comprises only outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b>, which act as both an inlet for the cooler air and an outlet for the warmer air.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">While outlet ventilation ducts <b>42</b> of integral structure <b>300</b> are seal welded to shell <b>34</b>, it is possible for the outlet ventilation ducts to be located in the lid <b>41</b> if desired. Moreover, the concept of eliminating the inlet ventilation ducts for low heat load canister storage can be applied to any of the underground or above ground VVO embodiments illustrated in this application, specifically including underground VVO <b>20</b> and it derivatives.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">While the invention has been described and illustrated in sufficient detail that those skilled in this art can readily make and use it, various alternatives, modifications, and improvements should become readily apparent without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Specifically, it is possible for the entire underground VVO and/or integral structure of the present invention to be below grade, so long as the inlet ventilation ducts and/or outlet ventilation ducts open to the ambient air above grade. This facilitates very deep storage of spent fuel canisters.</p>
