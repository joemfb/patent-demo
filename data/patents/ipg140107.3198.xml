<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2011-0004088, filed on Jan. 14, 2011, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aspects of one or more embodiments of the present invention relate to an organic light-emitting display device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Organic light-emitting display devices, which are self-emitting display devices that electrically excite an organic compound to emit light, have attracted much attention as next-generation display devices because the organic light-emitting display devices may be driven at a low voltage, may be easily made with a thin profile, and have advantages such as wide viewing angles, fast response speeds, etc., which are pointed out as problems in liquid crystal display (LCD) devices.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the organic light-emitting display devices, pixels that emit light are divided by an insulating layer, e.g., a pixel-defining layer. The pixel-defining layer is mainly formed of an organic material, such as acryl, that discharges a gas in a baking process or in a driving process.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Such a gas may degrade characteristics of the organic light-emitting devices or exfoliate the pixel-defining layer.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Aspects of embodiments according to the present invention are directed toward an organic light-emitting display device capable of preventing or reducing degradation of characteristics of an organic light-emitting device due to discharge of gas from an organic material.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an organic light-emitting display device including: a substrate; a thin-film transistor on the substrate; a first insulating layer covering the thin-film transistor; a first electrode on the first insulating layer, and electrically connected to the thin-film transistor; a second insulating layer on the first insulating layer so as to cover the first electrode, and having an opening for exposing a part of the first electrode; a porous member in the second insulating layer; a second electrode on the second insulating layer, and facing the first electrode so as to correspond to the opening; and an organic emission layer between the first electrode and the second electrode so as to correspond to the opening.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The porous member may be on the first insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Three surfaces of the porous member, except for a surface of the porous member contacting the first insulating layer, may contact the second insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The porous member may surround the first electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The porous member may continuously surround the first electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The porous member may discontinuously surround the first electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The porous member may be formed of an oxide or a carbide of a material selected from the group consisting of silicon (Si), titanium (Ti), aluminum (Al), zinc (Zn), and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an organic light-emitting display device including: a substrate; an organic emission unit on the substrate, and including a plurality of organic light-emitting devices; an insulating layer on the substrate; and a porous member in the insulating layer.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Now, exemplary embodiments according to the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a pixel of an organic light-emitting display device, according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the organic light-emitting display device includes a substrate <b>10</b>, a buffer layer <b>11</b> formed on the substrate <b>10</b>, and a thin-film transistor T formed on the buffer layer <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The buffer layer <b>11</b> may planarize a surface of the substrate <b>10</b> by reducing or preventing permeation of impurities therein. The buffer layer <b>11</b> may be formed of any suitable material. For example, the buffer layer <b>11</b> may be formed of an inorganic material such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, aluminum oxide, aluminum nitride, titanium oxide, or titanium nitride, an organic material such as polyimide, polyester, or acryl, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the buffer layer <b>11</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">An active layer <b>12</b> formed of a semiconductor material may be patterned on the buffer layer <b>11</b>. The active layer <b>12</b> may be formed of polycrystal silicon, but the present invention is not limited thereto, and thus, the active layer <b>12</b> may be formed of an oxide semiconductor. For example, the oxide semiconductor may be a G-I&#x2014;Z&#x2014;O layer [a (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)a(Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)b(ZnO)c layer], wherein a, b, and c are real numbers that satisfy conditions of a&#x2267;0, b&#x2267;0, and c&#x3e;0, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A gate insulating layer <b>13</b> is formed on the buffer layer <b>11</b> so as to cover the active layer <b>12</b>, and a gate electrode <b>14</b> is formed on the gate insulating layer <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">An interlayer insulating layer <b>15</b> is formed on the gate insulating layer <b>13</b> so as to cover the gate electrode <b>14</b>, and a source electrode <b>16</b> and a drain electrode <b>17</b> are formed on the interlayer insulating layer <b>15</b> and each contact the active layer <b>12</b> via a contact hole.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">At least one thin-film transistor T having the above-described structure may be formed for each pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The thin-film transistor T is covered by a first insulating layer <b>18</b>. The first insulating layer <b>18</b> has a layered structure that has at least one layer that is formed on the interlayer insulating layer <b>15</b>. The first insulating layer <b>18</b> may be formed of an organic material and/or an inorganic material. The organic material may be a polymer material such as acryl, polyimide, or polyester, and the inorganic material may be silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, aluminum oxide, aluminum nitride, titanium oxide, or titanium nitride.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A first electrode <b>21</b> is formed on the first insulating layer <b>18</b> and is connected to the drain electrode <b>17</b> via a via-hole formed in the first insulating layer <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A second insulating layer <b>24</b> is formed on the first insulating layer <b>18</b> and covers both edges of the first electrode <b>21</b>. The second insulating layer <b>24</b> includes an opening <b>25</b> for exposing a part of the first electrode <b>21</b>. The second insulating layer <b>24</b> may be formed of an organic material such as acryl, polyimide, or polyester, but the present invention is not limited thereto, and thus, the second insulating layer <b>24</b> may be formed of an inorganic material or a combination of an organic material and an inorganic material.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">An organic emission layer <b>23</b> is formed on the first electrode <b>21</b> and the second insulating layer <b>24</b> so as to cover the part of the first electrode <b>21</b> exposed by the opening <b>25</b>, and a second electrode <b>22</b> is formed on the organic emission layer <b>23</b> and the second insulating layer <b>24</b> so as to cover the organic emission layer <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The first electrode <b>21</b> is patterned for each pixel, and the second electrode <b>22</b> is formed as a common electrode so as to cover all the pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The first electrode <b>21</b>, the second electrode <b>22</b>, and the organic emission layer <b>23</b> constitute an organic light-emitting device <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The first electrode <b>21</b> and the second electrode <b>22</b> may be formed to have opposite polarities. That is, the first electrode <b>21</b> and the second electrode <b>22</b> may be an anode and a cathode, respectively, or vice-versa.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">An electrode functioning as an anode may include a conductor having a work function of a high absolute value, and an electrode functioning as a cathode may include a conductor having a low absolute value of a work function. The conductor having a work function of a high absolute value may be a transparent conductive oxide material such as indium tin oxide (ITO), In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, zinc oxide (ZnO), or indium zinc oxide (IZO), but the present invention is not limited thereto, and the conductor having a high absolute value of a work function may be a noble metal such as gold (Au). The conductor having a low absolute value of a work function may be silver (Ag), aluminum (Al), magnesium (Mg), lithium (Li), calcium (Ca), lithium fluoride (LiF)/Ca, or LiF/Al.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a top emission type display, in which an image is displayed in an opposite direction of the substrate <b>10</b>, the first electrode <b>21</b> may include a light reflector, and the second electrode <b>22</b> may be a light-transmitting type electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Here, when the first electrode <b>21</b> functions as an anode, the light reflector may be formed of any one metal selected from the group consisting of Ag, Mg, Al, platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), Au, Ni, neodymium (Nd), iridium (Ir), chromium (Cr), and combinations thereof, and ITO, IZO, ZnO, or In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>having a high work function is formed on the light reflector. When the first electrode <b>21</b> functions as a cathode, the light reflector may be formed of any one metal selected from the group consisting of Ag, Al, Mg, Li, Ca, LiF/Ca, LiF/Al, and combinations thereof that has a low work function and is a light reflective material.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the second electrode <b>22</b> functions as a cathode, the second electrode <b>22</b> may have a thin profile so as to be a semi-permeable layer formed of any one metal selected from the group consisting of Li, Ca, LiF/Ca, LiF/Al, Al, Mg, or Ag having a low work function. A transparent conductor such as ITO, IZO, ZnO, or In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>may be formed on the semi-permeable layer, thereby solving a high resistance problem due to the thin thickness of the second electrode <b>22</b>. When the second electrode <b>22</b> functions as an anode, the transparent conductor such as ITO, IZO, ZnO, or In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>may be formed on the second electrode <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Materials for forming the first electrode <b>21</b> and the second electrode <b>22</b> are not limited to those described above, and the first electrode <b>21</b> and the second electrode <b>22</b> may be formed of other different suitable materials within the scope that one of ordinary skill in the art would use.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The first electrode <b>21</b> and the second electrode <b>22</b> respectively apply voltages having opposite polarities to the organic emission layer <b>23</b> interposed therebetween so that light emission occurs at the organic emission layer <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The organic emission layer <b>23</b> may be formed of a low or high molecular organic material. When the organic emission layer <b>23</b> is a low molecular organic material, the organic emission layer <b>23</b> may be configured as a single-layer including a hole injection layer (HIL), a hole transport layer (HTL), an emission layer (EML), an electron transport layer (ETL), or an electron injection layer (EIL) or as a multi-layer including a combination thereof. The organic material may be copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), N,N&#x2032;-Di(naphthalene-1-yl)-N,N&#x2032;-diphenyl-benzidine (NPB), tris-8-hydroxyquinoline aluminum (Alq3), or the like. The organic emission layer <b>23</b> formed of the low molecular organic material may be formed using a vacuum evaporation method.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When the organic emission layer <b>23</b> is formed of a high molecular organic material, the organic emission layer <b>23</b> may generally have a structure including an HTL and an EML. Here, the HTL may be formed of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), and the EML may be formed of a poly-Phenylene vinylene (PPV)-based high molecular organic material or a polyfluorene-based high molecular organic material, and the HTL and the EML may be formed using a screen printing method or an inkjet printing method.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">However, the present invention is not limited thereto, and the above-described organic emission layer <b>23</b> may be formed of various other suitable materials or may be formed using any of various other suitable methods.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A porous member <b>26</b> is formed in the second insulating layer <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The porous member <b>26</b> may be formed of a gas adsorption material. The porous member <b>26</b> may be formed of an oxide or a carbide such as silicon (Si), Ti, Al, or Zn. In more detail, the porous member <b>26</b> may be formed of a silicon oxide, a titanium oxide, an aluminum oxide, or a zinc oxide that have suitable porosity. The porous member <b>26</b> may also be formed of a silica-based material such as SiC having high mechanical characteristics, a wide bandgap, and chemical stability.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The porous member <b>26</b> has a large surface area, and thus, may easily adsorb gas. The porous member <b>26</b> may be used as a high temperature heat blocking layer due to its high resistance and low heat conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Also, the porous member <b>26</b> may be an organic/inorganic composite that may be made by inserting an organic material capable of forming pores into an inorganic matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When the first insulating layer <b>18</b> and/or the second insulating layer <b>24</b> are/is formed of an organic material, the porous member <b>26</b> may adsorb the gas discharged from the organic material, and thus, the porous member <b>26</b> may reduce or prevent degradation of the organic light-emitting device <b>20</b> due to the gas. Also, the porous member <b>26</b> may reduce or prevent the second insulating layer <b>24</b> from being exfoliated by the first insulating layer <b>18</b> due to the gas.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The porous member <b>26</b> may be formed of a material having a low refractive index, and thus, the porous member <b>26</b> may provide a diffusion effect to light emitted from the organic emission layer <b>23</b> toward the second insulating layer <b>24</b> so as to further increase an emission efficiency of the organic light-emitting device <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The porous member <b>26</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, may be formed on the same layer the first electrode <b>21</b> is formed, that is, on the first insulating layer <b>18</b>. The porous member <b>26</b> may be covered by the second insulating layer <b>24</b>. Thus, three surfaces of the porous member <b>26</b>, except for a surface of the porous member <b>26</b> contacting the first insulating layer <b>18</b>, may contact the second insulating layer <b>24</b>. Thus, the porous member <b>26</b> may easily adsorb the gas discharged from the second insulating layer <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition, the porous member <b>26</b> may be completely buried in the second insulating layer <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The porous member <b>26</b> may be formed to surround each pixel. That is, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the porous member <b>26</b> may be formed to surround the first electrode <b>21</b>. In this case, the porous member <b>26</b> may be formed as a rectangular loop to surround the first electrode <b>21</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, or may be formed discontinuously to surround the first electrode <b>21</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Although not shown in the drawings, the porous member <b>26</b> may contact a part of a side surface of the first electrode <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating an organic light-emitting display device according to another embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an organic emission unit <b>19</b>, including a plurality of organic light-emitting devices, is disposed approximately in a central area of the substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The organic emission unit <b>19</b> includes a plurality of pixels such as the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, that is, the organic emission unit <b>19</b> includes a plurality of the organic light-emitting devices <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The organic emission unit <b>19</b> is formed on the first insulating layer <b>18</b>, and the second insulating layer <b>24</b> is formed in the organic emission unit <b>19</b> and at an outer area thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Sealants <b>31</b> are formed in an outer area of the organic emission unit <b>19</b>, and a sealing substrate <b>30</b> is adhered to the sealant <b>31</b> to be coupled to the substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the second insulating layer <b>24</b> extends between the sealant <b>31</b> and the substrate <b>10</b>, but the present invention is not limited thereto. The second insulating layer <b>24</b> may not be formed in a portion between the sealant <b>31</b> and the substrate <b>10</b>, i.e., may not extend between them, and the sealant <b>31</b> may be directly formed on the substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In this structure, the porous member <b>26</b> may be formed in a non-emission area formed outside of the organic emission unit <b>19</b>. Here, the porous member <b>26</b> is formed in the second insulating layer <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The porous member <b>26</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, may be formed on the first insulating layer <b>18</b>, and may be covered by the second insulating layer <b>24</b>. Thus, three surfaces of the porous member <b>26</b>, except for a surface of the porous member <b>26</b> contacting the first insulating layer <b>18</b>, may contact the second insulating layer <b>24</b>. Although not shown in the drawings, when the organic light-emitting display device is a passive matrix type display in which the thin-film transistor T is not formed for each pixel, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the first insulating layer <b>18</b> may be omitted, and the porous member <b>26</b> may be formed on the substrate <b>10</b> and may be covered by the second insulating layer <b>24</b>. As the embodiment described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the porous member <b>26</b> may be completely buried in the second insulating layer <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic plan view illustrating a pattern of the porous member <b>26</b> of the organic light-emitting display device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, according to an embodiment of the present invention. The porous member <b>26</b> may be formed to surround the organic emission unit <b>19</b>. Here, the porous member <b>26</b> may be formed to completely surround the organic emission unit <b>19</b> as a rectangular loop, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, or may be formed to surround discontinuously, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
