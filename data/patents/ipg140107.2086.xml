<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority of U.S. provisional application No. 61/078,076 filed Jul. 3, 2008, which provisional application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to metal making equipment and processes, and more particularly to an apparatus, system, and method applicable to desulfurization stations for injecting desulfurization reagents into transfer ladles of molten metal.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is common when making steel to take molten iron from a blast furnace, subject it to desulfurization, introduce it into a basic oxygen furnace to remove carbon, and to then continuously cast the resultant liquid product. In desulfurization pretreatment, a lance is lowered into the molten iron in the transfer ladle and a controlled amount of powdered reagents consisting typically of magnesium, lime and calcium carbide is injected through the lance into the molten iron. Sulfur impurities are thereby reacted into insoluble sulfides that collect in the slag which can then be raked off. As a practical matter, it is desired to complete the desulfurization process without undue delay, in order not to interrupt downstream processing. If there is an interruption in flow or plugging of materials and the ribbon of continuous cast material becomes broken, significant costs are involved to restart the ribbon. Therefore, it is essential that desulfurization continue without significant interruption. To help ensure uninterrupted desulfurization, dual port lances such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,188,661 were introduced, followed by dual lance desulfurization stations, as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,010,658. In state of the art desulfurization stations, a mixture of powdered magnesium and a carrier reagent, like for example powdered lime and/or calcium carbide, is injected through each of a pair of lances of a dual lance station, or through each port of a dual port lance, into the molten iron.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The powdered reagents are initially stored in separate &#x201c;injectors&#x201d; each including a pressurized storage vessel and a single outlet orifice (co-injection). Alternatively, depending on the metallurgical treatment requirements of some applications, it is not required to use separate &#x201c;injectors&#x201d; but instead a single injector (mono-injection) is used that injects a suitable reagent containing the components required for that particular treatment application. For yet other metallurgical treatment requirements of some applications, it is required to use a combination of separate &#x201c;injectors&#x201d; and single injectors (multiple-injection) to be able to inject the desired combination of reagents for the given application.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For the sake of clarity the following disclosures do concentrate on the co-injection process of lime reagent and magnesium reagent but it shall be understood that the same principles shall apply to the other injection processes and suitable reagents as well. Flow of powdered reagent through the injector outlet orifice may be governed by a variable orifice valve of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,108,075, or by a fixed orifice valve. If a fixed orifice valve is used, flow rates may be varied by varying the pressure in the vessel, or by changing the orifice. A shut-off valve is also provided upstream of the orifice valve for selectively stopping flow through the orifice valve, thereby allowing for maintenance of the orifice valve.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Initially, an inert gas under pressure, which is typically referred to as transport gas, will be introduced into a tube below the outlet orifice of the lime injector to initiate flow of the lime reagent. The transport gas will then flow to a location below the outlet orifice of the magnesium injector, so the powdered lime can pick up the magnesium reagent and transport it to a lance.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of a dual-lance desulfurization station <b>10</b> of the prior art. Station <b>10</b> includes a first magnesium injector <b>2</b> having a magnesium supply vessel <b>12</b> and a first lime injector <b>4</b> having a lime supply vessel <b>14</b>, each injector <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> feeding material into a first supply pipe <b>16</b> through respective outlet orifices <b>18</b> and <b>20</b>. First supply pipe <b>16</b> carries material, with the help of an inert pressurized transport gas, to a first lance <b>22</b> for injection into molten metal contained within ladle <b>24</b>. Station <b>10</b> also includes a second magnesium injector <b>3</b> having a magnesium supply vessel <b>13</b> and a second lime injector <b>5</b> having a lime supply vessel <b>15</b>, each injector <b>3</b>, <b>5</b> feeding material into a second supply pipe <b>17</b> through respective outlet orifices <b>19</b> and <b>21</b>. Material from second magnesium injector <b>3</b> and second lime injector <b>5</b> flows with the aid of pressurized transport gas through second supply pipe <b>17</b> to a second lance <b>23</b> for injection into the molten metal within ladle <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As may be understood, dual lance system <b>10</b> requires a pair of magnesium injectors <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and a pair of lime injectors <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> in order to supply each of the dual injection lances <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> with a controlled amount of a suitably proportioned mixture of magnesium and lime. A similar duplication of reagent injectors is necessary in the case of a single immersion lance having independent, dual exit ports injecting magnesium-lime mixture though each port.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to eliminate the need for a duplicate set of reagent injectors in a dual lance or dual port desulfurization station.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to achieve this object, a dual outlet injector is provided in a desulfurization station, whereby reagent from the dual outlet injector may be fed simultaneously to two independent supply pipes respectively corresponding to a pair of lances or pair of lance ports of the desulfurization station. The dual outlet injector may comprise an outlet splitter adapted for attachment to the injector's reagent supply vessel. The outlet splitter may include an attachment flange and a pair of conduit branches extending from the flange, whereby powdered reagent may be simultaneously received into each conduit branch of the splitter from a common outlet of the reagent supply vessel. The splitter may further include a pair of orifice valves, one in each conduit branch, for regulating output flow from the injector to the associated supply pipe carrying reagent to a lance. The splitter may also include a gate or shut-off valve in each conduit branch at a location upstream from the orifice valve for selectively allowing and stopping flow through the associated conduit branch.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention extends to a dual lance or dual port desulfurization station comprising a first dual outlet injector having a magnesium supply vessel and a second dual outlet injector having another reagent supply vessel, such as a lime supply vessel. Each injector simultaneously feeds powdered reagent to two different supply pipes, whereby a suitable reagent mixture can be carried to each lance or lance port without the need for a duplicate pair of reagent injectors.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A programmable logic controller may be used to automatically operate the orifice valves of the injectors based on information from sensors and detectors installed in the desulfurization station. In one embodiment, weigh cells associated with the reagent supply vessels and flow sensors associated with the lance supply pipes send signal information to the programmable logic controller for feedback control to achieve and maintain a target mixing ratio and flow rate of reagent mixture to a pair of lances. It is also possible to install pressure sensors in the lance supply pipes and/or the reagent supply vessels for feedback control purposes. Manual operation is also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A diverter system may be installed between the lance supply pipes for diverting all flow to one lance or lance port when the other lance or lance port is malfunctioning or being serviced. The diverter system may be manually operated, and it may be connected to the programmable logic controller for automatic diversion of flow if a problem is sensed.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> of the drawings, wherein a desulfurization station formed in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is identified by reference numeral <b>110</b>. Desulfurization station <b>110</b> comprises a single magnesium injector <b>102</b> having a magnesium supply vessel <b>112</b> feeding powdered magnesium into a first supply pipe <b>116</b> and also into a second supply pipe <b>117</b> by way of an outlet splitter <b>40</b> attached to magnesium supply vessel <b>112</b> to receive powdered magnesium exiting the supply vessel through an outlet orifice <b>118</b> at a bottom portion of the vessel. Outlet splitter <b>40</b>, described in greater detail below, includes a first branch <b>42</b> connected to first supply pipe <b>116</b> and a second branch <b>43</b> connected to second supply pipe <b>117</b>, and is operable to inject powdered magnesium from vessel <b>112</b> into both supply pipes <b>116</b> and <b>117</b>. Supply pipes may be, for example, &#xbe; inch pipe (0.75 inch ID, 1.05 inch OD), 1 inch pipe (1.0 inch ID, 1.31 inch OD), or other size pipe suitable for flow communication with lances <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Likewise, desulfurization station <b>110</b> further comprises a single lime injector <b>104</b> having a lime supply vessel <b>114</b> feeding powdered lime into first supply pipe <b>116</b> and into second supply pipe <b>117</b> by way of another outlet splitter <b>40</b> attached to lime supply vessel <b>114</b> in association with an outlet orifice <b>120</b> of lime supply vessel <b>114</b>. As will be understood, lime is a carrier reagent in the example embodiments described herein, and another carrier reagent may be substituted for lime without straying from the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Powdered magnesium from injector <b>102</b> and powdered lime from injector <b>104</b> flows through first supply pipe <b>116</b> to a first lance <b>122</b> for injection into molten metal contained within a transfer ladle (not shown). In similar fashion, powdered magnesium from injector <b>102</b> and powdered lime from injector <b>104</b> flows through second supply pipe <b>117</b> to a second lance <b>123</b> for injection into molten metal contained within the transfer ladle (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Outlet splitter <b>40</b>, shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is designed for attachment to a reagent supply vessel, such as magnesium supply vessel <b>112</b> or lime supply vessel <b>114</b>. Splitter <b>40</b> may include a flange <b>44</b> adapted for attachment to the outlet portion of the supply vessel, for example by providing a bolt-hole circle about the flange or by configuring the flange to cooperate with other attachment devices. Splitter <b>40</b> may be removably attached to the supply vessel, for example by threaded fasteners or other suitable means, or permanently attached to the supply vessel, for example by welding. For typical applications, a six-inch diameter ANSI standard-class 300# flange may be used. As mentioned above, splitter <b>40</b> includes first branch <b>42</b> and second branch <b>43</b>. Branches <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> are each in communication with the vessel outlet orifice and may diverge slightly from one another as they extend downward from flange <b>44</b>. Each branch <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> defines a passageway for carrying powdered reagent out of the vessel to a different associated supply pipe <b>116</b>, <b>117</b>. By way of example, branches <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> may comprise 1&#xbd; inch pipe (1.5 inch ID, 1.9 inch OD). In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each branch <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> includes a gate valve <b>46</b> operable to shut-off or open flow from the vessel to the branch, and an orifice valve <b>48</b> located downstream from gate valve <b>46</b>. Gate valve may be a suitable commercially available valve, such as a 1&#xbd; inch Worcester ball valve, product #1 &#xbd;-4446TSE. Orifice valve <b>48</b> may be a fixed orifice valve, in which case flow rates may be varied by varying the pressure in the vessel, or by changing the orifice. Alternatively, orifice valve <b>48</b> may be a variable orifice valve having an adjustable orifice, for example a variable orifice valve of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,108,075.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the context of providing an outlet splitter <b>40</b> on each of the magnesium and lime supply vessels, several alternative orifice valve configurations are contemplated. These include four fixed orifice valves (two on the branches of the lime injector's splitter and two on the branches of the magnesium injector's splitter); four variable orifice valves (two on the branches of the lime injector's splitter and two on the branches of the magnesium injector's splitter); two fixed orifice valves on the branches of the lime injector's splitter and two variable orifice valves on the branches of the magnesium injector's splitter; or two fixed orifice valves on the branches of the magnesium injector's splitter and two variable orifice valves on the branches of the lime injector's splitter.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As may be appreciated, dual outlet injectors <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> enable desulfurization station <b>110</b> to operate with exactly one magnesium injector and exactly one lime injector. Consequently, a second magnesium injector and a second lime injector required in desulfurization stations of the prior art may be eliminated or used to provide another independent desulfurization station.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another aspect of the present invention, desulfurization station <b>110</b> may comprise a programmable logic controller (PLC) <b>50</b> that sends control signals to orifice valves <b>48</b> (in this case variable orifice valves) via lines <b>51</b> to automatically achieve and maintain desired flow rates of the respective reagents and a desired mixing ratio thereof. PLC <b>50</b> receives a plurality of input signals as feedback. The input signals may include respective weight signals from weigh cells <b>52</b> associated with supply vessels <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> communicated to PLC <b>50</b> by way of lines <b>53</b>, wherein the weight signals indicate the weight of reagent remaining in each vessel. The input signals may include respective flow rate signals from flow sensors <b>54</b> positioned along supply pipes <b>116</b> and <b>117</b> communicated to PLC <b>50</b> via lines <b>55</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, flow sensors <b>54</b> are located along each supply pipe <b>116</b>, <b>117</b> between the injection point of lime from injector <b>104</b> and the injection point of magnesium from injector <b>102</b> and also after (downstream from) the injection point of magnesium from injector <b>102</b>. PLC <b>50</b> may be programmed to send control signals to orifice valves <b>48</b> based on the input signals the PLC receives from weigh cells <b>52</b> and flow sensors <b>54</b> to continually adjust injection of reagent into supply lines <b>116</b> and <b>117</b> to achieve and maintain targeted reagent flow rates and a targeted mixing ratio for the reagent mixture delivered to lances <b>122</b> and <b>123</b>. As mentioned above, pressure sensors may be installed to provide additional feedback signals to PLC <b>50</b>. Of course, desulfurization station <b>110</b> may be manually controlled by overriding or omitting PLC <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a desulfurization station <b>210</b> formed in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Station <b>210</b> is generally similar to station <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, however a lance diverter system <b>60</b> is provided between supply pipes <b>116</b> and <b>117</b> for diverting some or all of the reagent flow from one supply pipe to the other, whereby only one of the dual lances <b>122</b>, <b>123</b> injects to ladle <b>24</b> while the other lance is serviced. Lance diverter system <b>60</b> includes a crossover pipe <b>62</b> from supply pipe <b>116</b> to supply pipe <b>117</b>, and another crossover pipe <b>64</b> from supply pipe <b>117</b> to supply pipe <b>116</b>. Flow through crossover pipe <b>62</b> is restricted by an associated valve <b>63</b>, and flow through crossover pipe <b>64</b> is restricted by an associated valve <b>65</b>. A shut-off valve <b>66</b> is located downstream from crossover pipe <b>62</b> along supply pipe <b>116</b> for selectively stopping flow to lance <b>122</b>, in which case flow from supply pipe <b>116</b> may be diverted to supply pipe <b>117</b> for injection by lance <b>123</b>. Similarly, a shut-off valve <b>68</b> is located downstream from crossover pipe <b>64</b> along supply pipe <b>117</b> for selectively stopping flow to lance <b>123</b>, in which case flow from supply pipe <b>117</b> may be diverted to supply pipe <b>116</b> for injection by lance <b>122</b>. Valves <b>63</b>, <b>65</b>, <b>66</b>, and <b>68</b> may be connected to PLC <b>50</b> by lines <b>69</b> for automatic diversion of flow to one of the lances if a flow problem is detected with respect to the other lance. Of course, the valves of lance diverter system <b>60</b> may be manually operated to divert flow if a problem is observed or detected.</p>
