<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">A UAV is a remotely piloted or self-piloted aircraft that can carry cameras, sensors, communications equipment, or other payloads, is capable of controlled, sustained, level flight, and is usually powered by an engine. A self-piloted UAV may fly autonomously based on preprogrammed flight plans.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">UAVs are becoming increasingly used for various missions where manned flight vehicles are not appropriate or not feasible. These missions may include military situations, such as surveillance, reconnaissance, target acquisition, data acquisition, communications relay, decoy, harassment, or supply flights. UAVs are also used for a growing number of civilian missions where a human observer would be at risk, such as firefighting, natural disaster reconnaissance, police observation of civil disturbances or crime scenes, and scientific research. An example of the latter would be observation of weather formations or of a volcano.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As miniaturization technology has improved, it is now possible to manufacture very small UAVs (sometimes referred to as micro-aerial vehicles, or MAVs). For examples of UAV and MAV design and operation, see U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 11/752,497, 11/753,017, and 12/187,172, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety herein.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A UAV can be designed to use a ducted fan for propulsion, and may fly like a helicopter, using a propeller that draws in air through a duct to provide lift. The UAV propeller is preferably enclosed in the duct and is generally driven by a gasoline engine. The UAV may be controlled using micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) electronic sensor technology.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Traditional aircraft may utilize a dihedral wing design, in which the wings exhibit an upward angle from lengthwise axis of the aircraft when the wings are viewed from the front or rear of this axis. A ducted fan UAV may lack a dihedral wing design and, therefore, it may be challenging to determine which direction a ducted fan UAV is flying. Consequently, it can be difficult for both manned and unmanned vehicles to avoid collisions with such a UAV. As UAVs are more widely deployed, the airspace will become more crowded. Thus, there is an increasing need to improve UAV collision avoidance systems.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, there currently exist a number of UAVs that are too small to carry the sensors required to perform on-board collision avoidance.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an embodiment, a system includes an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) configured to be equipped with data representing a first UAV flight plan, and a ground station configured to control the UAV. The ground station is operable to receive, at a first time, a first data set representing at least one flight path of at least one aircraft, calculate a second UAV flight plan to avoid the at least one flight path of the at least one aircraft, the second UAV flight plan being based on the data representing the first UAV flight plan and the first data set representing at least one flight path of the at least one aircraft, and transmit data representing the second UAV flight plan to the UAV.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an exemplary UAV <b>100</b>. UAV <b>100</b> may be used for reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition (RSTA) missions. For example, UAV <b>100</b> may launch and execute an RSTA mission by flying to one or more waypoints according to a flight plan before arriving at a landing position. Once launched, UAV <b>100</b> can perform such a UAV flight plan autonomously or with varying degrees of remote operator guidance from one or more ground control stations (&#x201c;ground station&#x201d;). UAV <b>100</b> may be a hovering ducted fan UAV, but alternative UAV embodiments can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">UAV <b>100</b> may include one or more active or passive sensors, such as a video camera or an acoustic sensor. In alternative embodiments, different types of sensors may be used in addition to the video camera and/or the acoustic sensor, such as motion sensors, heat sensors, wind sensors, RADAR, LADAR, electro-optical (EO), non-visible-light sensors (e.g. infrared (IR) sensors), and/or EO/IR sensors. Furthermore, multiple types of sensors may be utilized in conjunction with one another in accordance with multi-modal navigation logic. Different types of sensors may be used depending on the characteristics of the intended UAV mission and the environment in which the UAV is expected to operate.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">UAV <b>100</b> may also comprise a processor and a memory coupled to these sensors and other input devices. The memory is preferably configured to contain static and/or dynamic data, including the UAV's flight plan, flight corridors, flight paths, terrain maps, and other navigational information. The memory may also contain program instructions, executable by the processor, to conduct flight operations, and other operations, in accordance with the methods disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Generally speaking, UAV <b>100</b> may be programmed with a UAV flight plan that instructs UAV <b>100</b> to fly between a number of waypoints in a particular order, while avoiding certain geographical coordinates, locations, or obstacles. For example, if UAV <b>100</b> is flying in the vicinity of a commercial, civilian or military flight corridor, UAV <b>100</b> should avoid flying in this corridor during the flight corridor's hours of operation. Similarly, if UAV <b>100</b> is programmed with a flight path of a manned aircraft or another UAV, UAV <b>100</b> should adjust its UAV flight plan avoid this flight path. Additionally, if UAV <b>100</b> is flying according to its UAV flight plan and UAV <b>100</b> encounters a known or previously unknown obstacle, UAV <b>100</b> should adjust its UAV flight plan to avoid the obstacle.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Herein, the term &#x201c;flight plan&#x201d; generally refers to the planned path of flight of a UAV, such as UAV <b>100</b>, while the term &#x201c;flight path&#x201d; generally refers to an observed or planned path of flight of another aerial vehicle that the UAV may encounter. However, these terms may otherwise be used interchangeably.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example of a suitable operating environment, such as a ground station <b>200</b>, in which an embodiment of the invention may be implemented. The operating environment is only one example of a suitable operating environment and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of the invention. Well known computing systems, environments, and/or configurations that may be suitable for use with the invention include, but are not limited to, personal computers, server computers, hand-held, wearable computing systems, laptop devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based systems, programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, or distributed computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Embodiments of the invention may be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, executed by one or more computers or other devices. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Typically the functionality of the program modules may be combined or distributed as desired in various embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The operating environment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> typically includes at least some form of computer readable media. Computer readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by one or more components of such operating environment. By way of example, and not limitation, computer readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media.

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, illustrated in the form of a functional block diagram are modules executable by, and storable on at least one computer readable medium associated with or otherwise accessible to, a ground station <b>200</b>. The illustrated embodiment includes a mission logic system <b>205</b>, which in turn includes an operator-alerts module <b>210</b>, a degree-of-certainty-analyzer (DOC) module <b>215</b>, an overlays tool <b>220</b>, and a flight-plan-update tool <b>225</b>. The structure and function of the modules included by the mission logic system <b>205</b>, and principles under which they operate, incorporate concepts described in commonly owned U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0077214, which was filed on Sep. 17, 2007 and is entitled, &#x201c;System for Fusing Information from Assets, Networks, and Automated Behaviors&#x201d;; U.S. Pat. No. 8,543,265, which issued on Sep. 24, 2013 and is entitled, &#x201c;Systems and Methods for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Navigation&#x201d; and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0138521, which was filed on Sep. 17, 2007 and is entitled, &#x201c;Method and System for Sharing Information Between Disparate Data Sources In A Network&#x201d;, which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an embodiment, the station <b>200</b> receives, via one or more radios <b>221</b>, digital flight-path and/or position reports from airborne objects (AOs) <b>320</b>, which could be other UAVs, helicopters, fixed wing aircraft, or balloons and other lighter than air aircraft. These reports may include, for example, position, heading, altitude, and velocity of the AO <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A report/overlay (R/O) analyzer <b>236</b> is configured to process the AO flight-path reports and compare the information associated with the reports to current-position information <b>230</b> and future flight plans <b>235</b> of one or more UAVs <b>100</b> under the control of the station <b>200</b>. This comparison may generate one or more overlays of the projected respective positions of the controlled UAVs <b>100</b> and the AOs to enable a determination of potential flight-path conflicts.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The alerts module <b>210</b> is configured to provide instant alerts (e.g., auditory and/or displayed to a display device (not shown) associated with the station <b>200</b>) to the operator of the station <b>200</b> in response to a determination by the R/O analyzer <b>236</b> that one or more of the controlled UAVs <b>100</b> will be positioned within a user-configurable or pre-defined thresholds proximity of one or more of the AOs <b>320</b>. The pre-defined thresholds can be based on standards or other regulations.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The DOC module <b>215</b> is configured to calculate the degree of certainty resulting from the incoming flight-path reports. For example, the station <b>200</b> may be configured to receive a series of reports from the AOs over a period of time for purposes of updating the flight paths of such AOs. If the station <b>200</b> fails to receive a report of the series, either through station malfunction or a communication failure on the part of an AO, the DOC module <b>215</b> can calculate an estimate of the AO's flight path based on the last report received from the AO. Additionally, the mission logic system <b>205</b> can notify the operator that the certainty of the position analysis is reduced and that manual operation of the controlled UAVs <b>100</b> should be resumed. The station <b>200</b> can also provide a displayed estimated flight path of the AO on an associated display device. The station <b>200</b> can also provide a maximum possible radius marker of the AO that is based on last known position augmented with information such as predicted location based on last known heading and speed information.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The overlays tool <b>220</b> is configured to generate &#x201c;control measure&#x201d; overlays representing the flight paths of the AOs in order to enable construction by the update tool <b>225</b> of flight plans for the controlled UAVs <b>100</b> and to ensure that the operator does not plan a controlled-UAV route or manually direct a controlled UAV into a position in conflict with an actual or potential AO position or is at least notified of a potential conflict requiring additional coordination on the part of the UAV operator.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The update tool <b>225</b> takes into account all the information from the other modules of the mission logic system <b>205</b>, as well as the current position of controlled UAVs <b>100</b>, current flight plans of controlled UAVs, and incoming AO reports, and automatically updates the controlled-UAV flight plans to avoid collisions with AOs.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The flight planning module <b>240</b> and flight control module <b>245</b> are configured to communicate with the controlled UAVs <b>100</b> to upload safe, non-conflicting flight plans, and uploads these new flight plans when the mission logic system <b>205</b> determines that the controlled UAVs <b>100</b> are on a potential collision course with one or more AOs.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The control measures and digital messaging module <b>250</b> is configured to communicate using radios <b>221</b> the proposed flight plans for the controlled UAVs <b>100</b> to the AOs <b>320</b> and/or air traffic management sites for coordination and approval. Such communications can be expanded to support pre-approval and flight clearances with appropriate agencies.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts an exemplary embodiment of a controlled UAV, such as UAV <b>100</b>, using an updated flight plan received from station <b>200</b> to avoid an aircraft <b>320</b>. UAV <b>100</b> is flying according to a pre-programmed UAV flight plan <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">At point G, UAV <b>100</b> receives an updated flight plan from station <b>200</b> in response to station having determined that aircraft <b>320</b> is flying according to aircraft vector <b>330</b>. UAV <b>100</b> may then follow the updated flight plan to avoid aircraft <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As alluded to above herein, the characteristics of the updated flight plan may be configured by a user of the station <b>200</b> or pre-defined based on standards or regulations. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the station <b>200</b> may be configured to generate an alert to an associated display device via a user interface <b>400</b> that allows a user to select collision avoidance settings that the station can use to develop updated flight plans for controlled UAVs <b>100</b>. A distance setting <b>410</b> allows the user to specify the minimum distance between a controlled UAV <b>100</b> and an AO that the controlled UAV should observe in following the updated flight plan. Additionally, a style setting <b>420</b> allows the user to specify a particular maneuver style that the controlled UAV <b>100</b> should observe in following the updated flight plan. Such maneuver styles may include Always Descend (Down), Always Ascend (Up), Safest (e.g., descend if below airborne object; ascend if above airborne object), Fastest (e.g., used if the UAV can ascend faster than it can descend, or vice versa). In addition, the system may use pre-defined settings such as from Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations or other standard operating procedures in response to selection of setting <b>430</b>.</p>
