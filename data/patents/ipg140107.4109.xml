<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Hereinafter, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">First, a basic principle of the exemplary embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In recent years, apparatuses that deal with images having a color gamut different from that of conventional printed material have been increasing due to the dissemination of personal computers (PCs) and the development of displays. Conventional printed material is expressed using a color gamut called &#x201c;Japan Color&#x201d;. Meanwhile, in digital cameras, for example, a color gamut called &#x201c;sRGB&#x201d; or &#x201c;Adobe RGB&#x201d; is normally used to cover a wider range of colors. Thus, colors of printed material actually output from a printer may be considerably different from colors viewed on a display.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Two methods are available as a method for addressing such a problem. One is a method for covering a color gamut by increasing the number of colors used in a printer from the conventional four (YMCK) to six or seven. The other is a method for enabling output of a color gamut corresponding to a display by changing the color hue of the currently used four colors.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">However, the necessity of greatly changing the body of a printer arises in the former method, whereas the color gamut of conventionally output printed material is not satisfied in the latter method.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Accordingly, the exemplary embodiment enables output of both the color gamut of Japan Color, which is suitable for printed material, and the color gamut of sRGB, which is close to the color gamut on a display, while using the conventional four colors (YMCK).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Now, a conventional typical color expression method will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the typical color expression method, solid colors are placed at the periphery of a color gamut, and lighter colors (on an inner side of the color gamut) are expressed by generating halftone through a screen process. Such a color expression method is called area coverage modulation.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> illustrate the state of toner on a sheet in a case where a dark color is reproduced and the state of toner on a sheet in a case where a light color is reproduced by using the typical color expression method. Among those figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates the state of toner when a primary color is reproduced, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates the state of toner when a secondary color is reproduced by mixing primary colors. As is clear from the figures, in this typical color expression method, a light color is expressed using halftone for each of the primary color and the secondary color. The right side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a schematic view. Actually, two toners that are overlapped may deviate from each other depending on the manner of a screen process. Here, overlapping of all the two or more toners is not always necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating a color gamut in a case where the typical color expression method is used.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the hue and saturation of solid primary colors are represented by black squares, and the hue and saturation of secondary colors generated by overlapping the solid primary colors are represented by a solid line in an a*b* plane. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, colors expressed using halftone exist on a straight line extending between the origin and a point representing the hue and saturation of a solid color, and thus the colors in the hexagonal range defined by the solid line may be expressed. That is, the hexagonal range corresponds to a color gamut in a case where the typical color expression method is used.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the hue and saturation of Japan Color are also shown in the a*b* plane. That is, in the typical color expression method, colors close to Japan Color may be reproduced.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Note that, in the exemplary embodiment, the amount of toner in the typical color expression method is regarded as 100%, and the periphery of the color gamut in a case where the typical color expression method is used is referred to as &#x201c;100% solid color&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">On the other hand, according to the exemplary embodiment, it has been found that a color gamut may be changed by changing the amount of toner.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> are diagrams illustrating changes in hue and saturation when the amount of magenta toner is changed. Among those figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates changes in hue and saturation in a case where PR<b>122</b> is used as a pigment, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates changes in hue and saturation in a case where PR<b>238</b> is used as a pigment. In both the figures, the origin corresponds to a density of 0%, and the other points correspond to densities of 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 150%, 200%, and 300% along the curve with increasing distance from the origin.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Regarding cyan and yellow, similar diagrams illustrating changes in hue and saturation when the amount of toner is changed may be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">On the basis of such findings, colors are expressed by changing the amount of toner in the exemplary embodiment. Such a color expression method is called density modulation. In the exemplary embodiment, the amount of toner for realizing a certain color gamut is regarded as a reference, and lighter colors are expressed using area coverage modulation.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> illustrate the state of toner on a sheet in a case where a dark color is reproduced and the state of toner on a sheet in a case where a light color is reproduced by using the color expression method according to the exemplary embodiment. Among those figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates the state of toner when a primary color is reproduced. At this time, a light color is expressed by reducing the amount of toner. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates the state of toner when a secondary color is reproduced by mixing the light color illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. At this time, since the light color illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is expressed by reducing the amount of toner, a color lighter than the light color is expressed using halftone. The right side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a schematic view, like the right side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram illustrating a color gamut in a case where the color expression method according to the exemplary embodiment is used.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the hue and saturation change along a thin chain curve when the amount of magenta toner is changed. Also, the hue and saturation change along a thin dotted curve and a thin broken curve when the amount of cyan toner and the amount of yellow toner are changed respectively. At this time, the hue and saturation change in the direction toward the origin along the curve if the amount of toner is reduced, and the hue and saturation change in the direction away from the origin along the curve if the amount of toner is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the hue and saturation of 100% solid primary colors are represented by black squares, and the hue and saturation of secondary colors generated by overlapping the 100% solid primary colors are represented by a bold solid line in an a*b* plane. Also, the color gamut in a case where the amount of toner for solid colors is 70% is represented by a bold dotted line, and the color gamut in a case where the amount of toner for solid colors is 150% is represented by a bold chain line. That is, by continuously decreasing the amount of toner from 100% to 70% or continuously increasing the amount of toner from 100% to 150%, colors in the color gamut defined by the bold chain line to the color gamut defined by the bold dotted line via the color gamut defined by the bold solid line may be evenly covered. Particularly, the color gamut on the side of a density lower than 100% is close to the sRGB color gamut of a display that cannot be covered by the foregoing typical color expression method.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Next, an image forming apparatus to which the exemplary embodiment may be applied will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration example of an image forming apparatus <b>1</b> to which the exemplary embodiment is applied. The image forming apparatus <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a so-called tandem color printer and includes an image forming section <b>10</b> and a control unit <b>30</b>. The image forming section <b>10</b> is an example of an image forming section that performs image formation on the basis of image data. The control unit <b>30</b> controls operation of the entire image forming apparatus <b>1</b>. Furthermore, the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> includes a communication unit <b>35</b> that communicates with a personal computer (PC) <b>3</b> or the like to receive image data, an image reading unit <b>50</b> that reads an image from a document to generate read image data, an image processing unit <b>70</b> that performs predetermined image processing on the image data received by the communication unit <b>35</b> or the read image data generated by the image reading unit <b>50</b> and that transfers the image data to the image forming section <b>10</b>, and a user interface (UI) unit <b>80</b> that accepts input of an operation from a user and that displays various pieces of information to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The image forming section <b>10</b> is a section that forms an image using an electrophotographic system, for example, and includes four image forming units <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, and <b>11</b>K (hereinafter referred to as image forming units <b>11</b>) that are arranged in parallel. Each of the image forming units <b>11</b> includes, as functional members, a photoconductor drum <b>12</b> serving as an example of an image carrier on which an electrostatic latent image is formed while being rotated in the direction indicated by an arrow A and on which a toner image is formed thereafter, a charging device <b>13</b> that causes the surface of the photoconductor drum <b>12</b> to be charged at a predetermined potential, an exposure device <b>14</b> that causes the photoconductor drum <b>12</b> charged by the charging device <b>13</b> to be exposed on the basis of image data, a developing device <b>15</b> that develops an electrostatic latent image formed on the photoconductor drum <b>12</b> with toner of a corresponding color, and a drum cleaner <b>16</b> that cleans the surface of the photoconductor drum <b>12</b> after transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The individual image forming units <b>11</b> have configurations substantially similar to each other except the toner accommodated in the developing device <b>15</b>, and form toner images of yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C), and black (K), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The image forming section <b>10</b> also includes an intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b> onto which toner images of respective colors formed on the photoconductor drums <b>12</b> of the respective image forming units <b>11</b> are transferred, and first transfer rollers <b>21</b> that sequentially transfer toner images of the respective colors formed in the respective image forming units <b>11</b> onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b> (first transfer). Furthermore, the image forming section <b>10</b> includes a second transfer roller <b>22</b> that transfers all the toner images of the respective colors transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b> onto paper P (second transfer), which is a recording medium (recording paper), and a fuser <b>60</b> that causes the second-transferred toner images of the respective colors to be fused onto the paper P.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The image forming units <b>11</b> of the image forming section <b>10</b> form toner images of yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C), and black (K), respectively, through an electrophotographic process using the foregoing functional members. The toner images of the respective colors formed in the image forming units <b>11</b> are electrostatically transferred in order onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b> by the first transfer rollers <b>21</b>, so that a composite toner image in which the toner images of the respective colors are superimposed is formed. The composite toner image on the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b> is transported to a second transfer region Tr where the second transfer roller <b>22</b> is placed in accordance with the movement of the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b> (in the direction indicated by an arrow B), and is electrostatically transferred onto the paper P supplied from a paper container <b>40</b>. After that, the composite toner image that has been electrostatically transferred onto the paper P is fused onto the paper P through a fusing process performed by the fuser <b>60</b>. Then, the paper P on which the fused image is formed is transported to and accumulated on a paper loading unit <b>45</b> provided at an output unit of the image forming apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">On the other hand, the toner adhering to the photoconductor drum <b>12</b> after the first transfer (first transfer residual toner) and the toner adhering to the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b> after the second transfer (second transfer residual toner) are removed by the drum cleaner <b>16</b> and a belt cleaner <b>25</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this way, the image forming process in the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> is repeatedly performed in cycles the number of which corresponds to the number of printed sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the exemplary embodiment, in the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> capable of performing image formation by changing the amount of toner, a user is allowed to select any of a color gamut based on the conventional typical color expression method and a different color gamut such as the sRGB color gamut for forming an image, and image formation is performed with the amount of toner being adjusted in accordance with the selected color gamut.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As a method for adjusting the amount of toner, a method for controlling the amount of charge with which the photoconductor drum <b>12</b> is charged by the charging device <b>13</b> is available. Hereinafter, the control unit <b>30</b> and the image processing unit <b>70</b> will be described in detail, with the method for controlling the amount of charge on the photoconductor drum <b>12</b> being used as an example.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a configuration example of the control unit <b>30</b> and the image processing unit <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The control unit <b>30</b> includes a color gamut information obtaining unit <b>31</b>, a color gamut information memory <b>32</b>, a co-rule memory <b>33</b>, and a screen controller <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When a user inputs information about the color gamut to be reproduced from the UI unit <b>80</b>, the color gamut information obtaining unit <b>31</b> obtains information that specifies the color gamut (color gamut information) on the basis of the input. In the exemplary embodiment, the color gamut information obtaining unit <b>31</b> is provided as an example of a determining unit that determines the color gamut to be reproduced.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The color gamut information memory <b>32</b> stores the color gamut information obtained by the color gamut information obtaining unit <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The co-rule memory <b>33</b> stores a rule prescribing a maximum density expressed using density modulation or a minimum density expressed using area coverage modulation (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;co-rule&#x201d;) in a case where the densities of individual color signals of YMC are expressed using density modulation and area coverage modulation. For example, if the density of a C signal is 35%, a method for expressing a density of 70% using density modulation and expressing a density of 50% using area coverage modulation or a method for expressing a density of 50% using density modulation and expressing a density of 70% using area coverage modulation may be used. The former method is based on a rule prescribing that density modulation is used for expression up to 70% (area coverage modulation is used for expression over 70%), in which a density of 70% is employed as an example of a first density based on a color gamut and a density of 50% is employed as an example of a second density based on the first density. The latter method is based on a rule prescribing that density modulation is used for expression up to 50% (area coverage modulation is used for expression over 50%), in which a density of 50% is employed as an example of a first density based on a color gamut and a density of 70% is employed as an example of a second density based on the first density.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The screen controller <b>34</b> controls a screen process in a screen processing unit <b>75</b> of the image processing unit <b>70</b> on the basis of the color gamut information stored in the color gamut information memory <b>32</b> and the co-rule stored in the co-rule memory <b>33</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the screen controller <b>34</b> is provided as an example of a controller that performs control so that colors in a color gamut that cannot be reproduced if area coverage modulation, not density modulation, is used for expression are included in an image.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Also, the image processing unit <b>70</b> includes a drawing unit <b>72</b>, a rendering unit <b>73</b>, a gamma correction unit <b>74</b>, and the screen processing unit <b>75</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The drawing unit <b>72</b> converts color signals that are obtained through interpretation of a page description language (PDL) in the communication unit <b>35</b> or color signals transmitted from the image reading unit <b>50</b> (RGB in the figure) into color signals (YMCK) of the image forming section <b>10</b>. At that time, drawing is performed with an intermediate code corresponding to the resolution of the image forming section <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The rendering unit <b>73</b> renders the intermediate code drawn by the drawing unit <b>72</b> into raster image data.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The gamma correction unit <b>74</b> performs gamma correction on the individual color signals of YMCK.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The screen processing unit <b>75</b> performs a screen process (binarization process) on the individual gamma-corrected color signals generated by the gamma correction unit <b>74</b> (multivalued color signals) by using a dither pattern and outputs the color signals on which the screen process has been performed (binarized color signals) to the image forming section <b>10</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the screen processing unit <b>75</b> is provided as an example of an obtaining unit that obtains color signals.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, operations of the control unit <b>30</b> and the image processing unit <b>70</b> will be described. Note that a co-rule for a color gamut that is reproduced using both density modulation and area coverage modulation is stored in the co-rule memory <b>33</b> prior to the operations.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">First, a user inputs information specifying a color gamut to be reproduced (color gamut information) to the UI unit <b>80</b>. Here, it is assumed that any of information specifying Japan Color and information specifying sRGB is input as color gamut information.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Then, in the control unit <b>30</b>, the color gamut information obtaining unit <b>31</b> obtains the input color gamut information. Then, the obtained color gamut information is stored in the color gamut information memory <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Accordingly, the operation of the screen controller <b>34</b> starts.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an operation example of the screen controller <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">First, the screen controller <b>34</b> reads the color gamut information stored in the color gamut information memory <b>32</b> (step S<b>301</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Subsequently, the screen controller <b>34</b> determines whether the read color gamut information is information specifying Japan Color or information specifying sRGB (step S<b>302</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As a result, if the screen controller <b>34</b> determines that the read color gamut information is information specifying sRGB, the screen controller <b>34</b> determines a maximum percentage of density to be expressed using density modulation with reference to the co-rule stored in the co-rule memory <b>33</b> (step S<b>303</b>). For example, if a co-rule prescribing that density modulation is used for expression up to 70% for sRGB is stored in the co-rule memory <b>33</b>, the screen controller <b>34</b> determines that density modulation is used for expression up to a density of 70%.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Accordingly, the screen controller <b>34</b> outputs a charge amount control signal for setting a charge amount that realizes the density determined in step S<b>303</b> to the charging device <b>13</b> of the image forming section <b>10</b> (step S<b>304</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Then, the screen controller <b>34</b> instructs the screen processing unit <b>75</b> of the image processing unit <b>70</b> to perform a screen process in which density modulation is used for expression up to the density determined in step S<b>303</b> (step S<b>305</b>). For example, when it is assumed that an instruction to use density modulation for expression up to a density of 70% is provided to the screen processing unit <b>75</b>, the screen processing unit <b>75</b> performs a screen process on the individual color signals of YMC input via the drawing unit <b>72</b>, the rendering unit <b>73</b>, and the gamma correction unit <b>74</b> under the assumption that density modulation is used for expression up to the density specified by the screen controller <b>34</b>. For example, if the density of the input C signal is 35% and if the density specified by the screen controller <b>34</b> is 70%, the screen processing unit <b>75</b> performs a screen process for setting the density to 50% and outputs the individual color signals on which the screen process has been performed to the image forming section <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">On the other hand, if the screen controller <b>34</b> determines in step S<b>302</b> that the read color gamut information is information specifying Japan Color, the screen controller <b>34</b> instructs the screen processing unit <b>75</b> of the image processing unit <b>70</b> to perform a normal screen process (a screen process based on the typical color expression method described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, and <b>2</b>) in step S<b>306</b>. Accordingly, the screen processing unit <b>75</b> performs the normal screen process on the individual color signals of YMC input via the drawing unit <b>72</b>, the rendering unit <b>73</b>, and the gamma correction unit <b>74</b>, and outputs the individual color signals on which the screen process has been performed to the image forming section <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the exemplary embodiment, a color gamut that cannot be reproduced using the conventional typical color expression method is reproduced in the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> that forms an image using four colors YMCK. Alternatively, in a more generalized manner, a color gamut that cannot be reproduced by the conventional typical color expression method may be reproduced in an image forming apparatus that forms an image using n colors.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the exemplary embodiment, a color gamut to be reproduces is specified in accordance with an instruction of a user provided from the UI unit <b>80</b>, but another method is also acceptable. For example, an image input from the communication unit <b>35</b> or the image reading unit <b>50</b> may be analyzed and a color gamut to be reproduced may be specified on the basis of an analysis result. As an analysis method for such an image, the following method may be used, for example. The frequency of appearance of colors that are to be desirably expressed using sRGB in the image is determined. If the frequency of appearance of such colors is high, sRGB is specified as a color gamut to be reproduced.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Furthermore, in the exemplary embodiment, an instruction to perform a normal screen process is provided without referring to the co-rule stored in the co-rule memory <b>33</b> in the case of Japan Color, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. However, a rule prescribing that density modulation is used for expression up to a density of 100% and that area coverage modulation is used for expression over a density of 100% may be stored for Japan Color in the co-rule memory <b>33</b>, and an instruction to perform the normal screen process may be provided by referring to the rule.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Furthermore, in the exemplary embodiment, a method for changing the amount of toner by controlling the amount of charge on the photoconductor drum <b>12</b> is employed as a method for expressing the density of a color signal using density modulation, but another method may also be employed. For example, the amount of toner may be changed by performing an image formation process plural times, the process including a series of operations of first-transferring toner images of respective colors formed by the image forming units <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, and <b>11</b>K onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b>, second-transferring the first-transferred toner images of the respective colors onto a recording medium from the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b>, and fusing the second-transferred toner images of the respective colors onto the recording medium by the fuser <b>60</b>. Note that such a method is realized by providing a path for transporting again the recording medium onto which the toner images are once fused by the fuser <b>60</b> to the image forming units <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, and <b>11</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the exemplary embodiment, the control unit <b>30</b> in the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> performs control of changing a color gamut. Alternatively, this process may be performed by a multi-purpose computer.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Now, a description will be given of a hardware configuration of a computer <b>90</b> serving as the multi-purpose computer.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a diagram illustrating a hardware configuration of the computer <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the computer <b>90</b> includes a central processing unit (CPU) <b>91</b> serving as an operating unit, a memory <b>92</b> serving as a memory, and a magnetic disk device (hard disk drive (HDD)) <b>93</b>. Here, the CPU <b>91</b> executes various types of software, such as an operating system (OS) and an application, and realizes the foregoing functions. The memory <b>92</b> is a storage area that stores various types of software and data used for execution of the software. The magnetic disk device <b>93</b> is a storage area that stores data input to the various types of software and data output from the various types of software.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Furthermore, the computer <b>90</b> includes a communication interface (I/F) <b>94</b> for performing communication with the outside, a display mechanism <b>95</b> including a video memory and a display, and an input device <b>96</b>, such as a keyboard and a mouse.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The program that realizes the exemplary embodiment may be provided by being stored on a recording medium, such as a compact disc read only memory (CD-ROM), as well as through a communication unit.</p>
