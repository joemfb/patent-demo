<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a hydraulic system for actuating a transmission with a control hydraulics power source that includes a control hydraulic pump, a control pressure accumulator, and a low-pressure pump that provides low-pressure volumetric flow for a low-pressure hydraulic component.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is an object of the present invention to optimize a hydraulic system with regard to the design space, weight, costs, and energy efficiency.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The object of the present invention is achieved by a hydraulic system for actuating a transmission with a control hydraulics power source that includes a control hydraulic pump, a control pressure accumulator, and a low-pressure pump that provides low-pressure volumetric flow for a low-pressure hydraulic component. The low-pressure pump can be connected with the control hydraulic pump in a driving manner, and the control hydraulic pump is connected in a charging manner with the control pressure accumulator. Connection in a driving manner means that the low-pressure pump is utilized to drive the control hydraulic pump. The connection in a driving manner can be carried out mechanically or hydraulically, for example. The control hydraulic pump is connected in a driven manner with the low-pressure pump only occasionally, in order to charge the control pressure accumulator, preferably depending upon demand. The connection in a charging manner means that the control pressure accumulator is charged by the control hydraulic pump.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The low-pressure pump is preferably driven mechanically by an internal combustion engine. The low-pressure volumetric flow preferably involves a cooling oil flow, particularly to supply a wet running clutch with cooling oil. The utilization of the low-pressure pump to drive the control hydraulic pump has the advantage that an electric motor that would otherwise be necessary for driving the control hydraulic pump can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A preferred exemplary embodiment of the hydraulic system is characterized in that the control hydraulic pump is connected hydraulically with the low-pressure pump. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the low-pressure volumetric flow generated for the low-pressure hydraulic component, partially or occasionally is used hydraulically to drive the control hydraulic pump.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A further preferred exemplary embodiment of the hydraulic system is characterized in that the low-pressure pump is hydraulically connected with a hydraulic motor that drives the control hydraulic pump. The hydraulic motor is driven by the low-pressure volumetric flow of the low-pressure pump and is connected in a driving manner with the control hydraulic pump, for example mechanically connected.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A further preferred exemplary embodiment of the hydraulic system is characterized in that an output of the hydraulic motor is or can be connected with the low-pressure hydraulic component. Therefore, the volumetric flow used to drive the control hydraulic pump can be fed to the low-pressure hydraulic component.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A further preferred exemplary embodiment of the hydraulic system is characterized in that the control hydraulic pump is or can be connected mechanically in a driven manner with the low-pressure pump and with an internal combustion engine. The control hydraulic pump can be driven directly via a corresponding mechanical coupling by the internal combustion engine. The control hydraulic pump can also be driven by a similar mechanical coupling via the low-pressure pump.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A further preferred exemplary embodiment of the hydraulic system is characterized in that a clutch is integrated between the control hydraulic pump and the low-pressure pump or the internal combustion engine. Thus, the control hydraulic pump can be driven occasionally, as required, when the clutch is engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A further preferred exemplary embodiment of the hydraulic system is characterized in that the clutch includes an electric actuating device. The electric clutch actuating device can be activated by an engine control, for example, in order to engage the clutch occasionally, as required, so that the control hydraulic pump is driven.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A further preferred exemplary embodiment of the hydraulic system is characterized in that the clutch includes a hydraulic actuating device. The hydraulic clutch actuating device can preferably be connected hydraulically with the low-pressure pump.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention further relates to a transmission with a hydraulic system as described above. The transmission can be a stepped automatic transmission or a twin clutch transmission. The transmission is preferably executed as a stepless, adjustable pulley, chain driven transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention further relates to a process for actuating the transmission described above, whereby the low-pressure pump is used for driving the control hydraulic pump. In accordance with an essential aspect of the invention, the low-pressure pump is used in order to drive the control hydraulic pump. The low-pressure volumetric flow of the low-pressure pump can be used in order to drive the control hydraulic pump hydraulically. In the process, a change occurs from a high volumetric flow at low-pressure to a low volumetric flow at high pressure. This energy change occurs preferably only briefly in order to charge the pressure accumulator via the control hydraulic pump. Another possibility is to conduct the energy of the low-pressure volumetric flow into a hydraulically switchable clutch by means of a valve. That clutch then briefly connects the control hydraulic pump with an engine of a vehicle in order to charge the pressure accumulator. A further possibility therein includes disposing a switchable clutch between the control hydraulic pump and the engine of the motor vehicle, a clutch that is actuated via any actuator, electrically, for example, in order to charge the pressure accumulator.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, four different exemplary embodiments of a hydraulic system in accordance with the invention are shown in the form of respective hydraulic circuit diagrams. The hydraulic system includes a vehicle engine <b>1</b> that is executed preferably as an internal combustion engine of a motor vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A low-pressure hydraulic component <b>2</b> is supplied with a cooling medium from a tank <b>4</b> by means of a low-pressure pump <b>5</b>. The cooling medium is preferably cooling oil that is withdrawn from the tank <b>4</b> through a throttle <b>6</b> and a valve <b>8</b>. The cooling medium that is withdrawn is fed from the low-pressure pump <b>5</b> via a further valve <b>10</b> to the hydraulic component <b>2</b>. The hydraulic component <b>2</b> can be, for example, a wet running clutch that is connected upstream of a transmission. Low-pressure pump <b>5</b> is driven directly by the engine <b>1</b> through a mechanical coupling <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The hydraulic systems shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> each include a control hydraulic pump <b>12</b> in addition to the low-pressure pump <b>5</b>. Control hydraulic pump <b>12</b> draws hydraulic medium from a tank <b>14</b> and delivers it to a pressure accumulator <b>16</b> and/or to a transmission actuator <b>18</b>. The hydraulic medium can be hydraulic oil.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The transmission actuator <b>18</b> is controlled or actuated hydraulically through the control hydraulic pump <b>12</b> or through the pressure accumulator <b>16</b>. In accordance with an essential aspect of the invention, the control hydraulic pump <b>12</b> is driven directly or indirectly by the low-pressure pump <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the low-pressure volumetric flow provided by the low-pressure pump <b>5</b> is fed occasionally and as required to a hydraulic motor <b>19</b> through the valve <b>10</b> in order to drive motor <b>19</b> hydraulically. The low-pressure volumetric flow utilized to drive the hydraulic motor <b>19</b> is then fed to a tank <b>22</b>. The tank <b>22</b> can be identical with the tank <b>4</b>. By means of rectangle <b>20</b>, it is indicated that the hydraulic motor <b>19</b> is connected with the control hydraulic pump <b>12</b> in order to drive the latter. In the rectangle <b>20</b>, the relatively large volumetric flow at low-pressure that is provided by the low-pressure pump <b>5</b> is transformed into a relatively small volumetric flow at high pressure by means of the hydraulic motor <b>19</b> and the control hydraulic pump <b>12</b>. The energy transformation within the rectangle <b>20</b> always occurs only briefly in order to charge the pressure accumulator <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> there is shown an exemplary hydraulic system embodiment that is generally similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but in which the low-pressure volumetric flow to drive the hydraulic motor <b>19</b> is fed to the hydraulic component <b>2</b> via recirculation line <b>25</b>. Otherwise, the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> corresponds with the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it is indicated by a rectangle <b>40</b> and a mechanical coupling <b>41</b> that the control hydraulic pump <b>12</b> can be mechanically driven through the mechanical couplings <b>11</b> and <b>41</b>, and the low-pressure pump <b>5</b> can be driven by the vehicle engine <b>1</b> through the mechanical coupling <b>11</b>. The vehicle engine <b>1</b> can be operatively connected as required via a coupling <b>44</b> in order to drive the control hydraulic pump <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The coupling <b>44</b> can be actuated by a hydraulic actuating device <b>45</b> that can be activated via a hydraulic line <b>46</b> and the valve <b>10</b>. Via the valve arrangement <b>10</b>, the low-pressure volumetric flow provided by the low-pressure pump can be fed entirely or partially to the hydraulic actuating device <b>45</b> in order to close the coupling <b>44</b> so that the control hydraulic pump <b>12</b> is mechanically driven by the vehicle engine <b>1</b>. In the closed state of the coupling <b>44</b>, the pressure accumulator <b>16</b> is charged from the tank <b>14</b> by the control hydraulic pump <b>12</b> that is driven by the vehicle engine <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a similar exemplary embodiment to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is shown, but includes within a rectangle <b>50</b> a clutch <b>54</b> is that is connected between the mechanical coupling <b>41</b> that connects low-pressure pump <b>5</b> and control hydraulic pump <b>12</b>. As indicated by an arrow <b>55</b>, the clutch <b>54</b> can be actuated via an actuator, for example, electrically, in order to charge the pressure accumulator <b>16</b>. In this exemplary embodiment and in the exemplary embodiment in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the hydraulic motor <b>19</b> can be omitted because the control hydraulic pump <b>12</b> can be coupled directly with the vehicle's engine <b>1</b> through the clutch <b>54</b> and the mechanical coupling <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Although particular embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit of the present invention. It is therefore intended to encompass within the appended claims all such changes and modifications that fall within the scope of the present invention.</p>
