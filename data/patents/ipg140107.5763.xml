<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to the field of communication technologies, and more particularly, to a communication method and communication device for transmitting multimedia data during a call.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">With the improvement of data processing capability of communication platforms, in recent decades have seen a considerable growth in the number of communication applications, such as short messages, phone books, games, photo graphing, multimedia players and so on. It is believed that the high-speed transfer of data across the communication network will be put into extensive applications with the development of various communication standards (e.g., SIP, GPRS, UMTS, CDMA, WAP, HSDPA).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">During communication, especially during a call, once a subscriber wants to play a multimedia data file (e.g., audio, picture or video data file stored in jpg, mp3, avi, wmv, rm, mpeg format) to the other subscriber of the call, how to transmit the multimedia data during the call, i.e. how to insert the multimedia data into the call is a problem.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to existing technical solutions, all multimedia data transmission resources are occupied at the beginning of a call and are then released at the end of the call, so that a large amount of resources are wasted when no multimedia data is being transmitted. Additionally, when subscribers wish to store more multimedia data for subsequent multimedia data transmission, more and more storage space will be consumed. Thus, the subscribers might have to lower the quality of picture, audio or vide data files by using high rate compression, so as to accommodate more data files.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of the problems described above, the present invention provides a communication method and communication device for transmitting multimedia data during a call.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a communication method for transmitting multimedia data during a call between terminals. The method can comprise the steps: receiving a multimedia data transmission request initiated from one of the terminals in the call; and responsive to the request, transmitting the multimedia data to one or more of the terminals in the call.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a communication device for transmitting multimedia data during a call between terminals. The communication device can comprise: a reception unit for receiving a multimedia data transmission request initiated from one of the terminals in the call; and a transmission unit for, responsive to the request, transmitting the multimedia data to one or more of the terminals in the call.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of embodiments illustrating the principles of the present invention, when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The main principle of the present invention is to transmit multimedia data to one or more terminals during a call upon request of a terminal while two or more terminals are in the call.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view of communication process of transmitting multimedia data to a terminal during a call according to the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, terminal 1 and terminal 2 are in a call. At this point, if terminal 1 intends to transmit specific multimedia data (e.g. audio, video, picture files or a combination thereof) to terminal 2 and/or itself, then terminal 1 can send a multimedia data transmission request to a multimedia communication device <b>3</b> of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Next, the communication device (e.g. multimedia communication device <b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) can learn terminal 1 intends to transmit what multimedia data to which terminal in the call, by analyzing the request. For example, terminal 1 wishes to transmit the song &#x201c;moonriver.mp3&#x201d; to terminal 1 itself and terminal 2 in the call.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Then, multimedia communication device <b>3</b> can search for the requested multimedia data, e.g. the song &#x201c;moonriver.mp3,&#x201d; among multimedia data pre-stored in its storage unit and then transmit the found multimedia data to terminals 1 and 2.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Afterwards, terminals 1 and 2 may play by multimedia players provided with themselves the multimedia data received from multimedia communication device <b>3</b>, while terminals 1 and 2 remain in the call state. In this way, subscribers to terminals 1 and 2 can listen to the song, watch video, appreciate pictures, or the like at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the present invention, multimedia communication device <b>3</b> may provide multimedia data transmission service. The term &#x201c;multimedia transmission service&#x201d; means that responsive to a terminal's request, multimedia communication device <b>3</b> transmits desired multimedia data to this terminal and/or the other terminal which is in a call with this terminal. For the multimedia transmission service, terminals may be registered to multimedia communication device <b>3</b> in advance. For example, when multimedia communication device <b>3</b> allows the providing of multimedia data transmission service to a terminal, on a terminal service record table stored on multimedia communication device <b>3</b> is recorded that multimedia data transmission service is enabled for this terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further, according to the present invention, in multimedia communication device <b>3</b> is also stored &#x201c;receive enabled/disabled&#x201d; information indicating whether a terminal agrees to receive multimedia data transmitted from multimedia communication device <b>3</b>. For the &#x201c;receive enabled/disabled&#x201d; information, a terminal is also registered to multimedia communication device <b>3</b> in advance. For example, if a terminal agrees to receive multimedia data transmitted from multimedia communication device <b>3</b>, then the &#x201c;receive enabled/disabled&#x201d; information in the terminal service record table is set as &#x201c;enabled.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of the terminal service record table on multimedia communication device <b>3</b>. As indicated in line 2, column 3 of Table 1, for terminal 1 with an address of 870001, &#x201c;multimedia data transmission service&#x201d; information is set as &#x201c;enabled&#x201d; on multimedia communication device <b>3</b>. This means that multimedia communication device <b>3</b> may, in response to a request of terminal 1, transmit desired multimedia data to terminal 1 and/or the other terminal which is in a call with terminal 1. Additionally, as indicated in line 2, column 4 of Table 1, for terminal 1 with an address of 870001, &#x201c;receive enabled/disabled&#x201d; information is set as &#x201c;enabled&#x201d;, which means that terminal 1 agrees to receive multimedia data. Likewise, as is clear from line 3 of Table 1, multimedia data transmission service is not enabled for terminal 2 with an address of 8700002, whereas terminal 2 can receive multimedia data transmitted from the multimedia communication device.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the present invention, transmitted multimedia data is stored in a storage unit in multimedia communication device <b>3</b>. The multimedia data may be pre-stored, provided by terminals, or provided by service providers. For example, when terminals are mobile phones, multimedia data is transferred via WAP to multimedia communication device <b>3</b> of the present invention. When terminals are personal computers, multimedia data is transferred to multimedia communication device <b>3</b> by HTTP, FTP or the like via a web server. In this manner, multimedia data stored in multimedia communication device <b>3</b> can be updated and managed by various means.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart of a communication method according to an embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, terminal 1 and terminal 2 are in a call. Terminal 1 sends to multimedia communication device <b>3</b> a multimedia data transmission request for the transmission of multimedia data to terminal 2 and terminal 1 itself. When it is determined that multimedia data transmission service has been enabled for terminal 1, and &#x201c;receive enabled/disabled&#x201d; information is set as &#x201c;enabled&#x201d; for terminals 1 and 2, multimedia data is transmitted. When multimedia data is being transmitted during the call, terminals 1 and 2 can keep the call without interruption.

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A content type &#x201c;application/play+xml&#x201d; is added to the body of the SIP INFO message, and the requested content is described in XML at the end of the body. In this embodiment, terminal 1 requests the transmission of &#x201c;moonriver.mp3&#x201d; to &#x201c;subscriber 2,&#x201d; i.e. terminal 2, in 5 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It is to be understood that the content type &#x201c;application/play+xml&#x201d; used in the SIP INFO message in this embodiment may also be &#x201c;application/play+txt&#x201d; or &#x201c;application/play+javascript&#x201d; for example. That is to say, the requested content may be described in plain text, javascript and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Additionally, it is to be understood that the request of terminal 1 may be sent by means of a message of other type in addition to the SIP INFO message.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In step <b>202</b>, a record for the terminal initiating the multimedia data transmission request is searched for. Specifically, upon receipt of the request from terminal 1, a record for terminal 1 is searched for in the terminal service record table as shown by Table 1. For example, the record for terminal 1 may include the address and name of terminal 1, &#x201c;multimedia data transmission service&#x201d; information, &#x201c;receive enabled/disabled&#x201d; information and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In step <b>203</b>, it is judged whether multimedia data transmission service has been enabled for the terminal. If yes, then the flow will go to step <b>204</b>. If not, then the flow will end.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In step <b>204</b>, a record for a terminal to which multimedia data is to be transmitted is searched for. In this embodiment, multimedia data will be transmitted to terminals 1 and 2, so records for terminals 1 and 2 are recorded in the terminal service record table.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In step <b>205</b>, it is judged whether the &#x201c;receive enabled/disabled&#x201d; information in the record for the terminal has been set as &#x201c;enabled.&#x201d; If yes, then the flow will go to step <b>206</b>. If not, then the flow will end. In this embodiment, since the &#x201c;receive enabled/disabled&#x201d; information in the record for each of terminals 1 and 2 is set as &#x201c;enabled,&#x201d; both of terminals 1 and 2 can receive the transmitted multimedia data. Then, the flow goes to step <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In step <b>206</b>, the requested multimedia data is obtained according to the received multimedia data transmission request.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As described previously, prior to the implementation of the method of the present invention, multimedia data used for transmission may be provided in various manners. For example, mobile phones, personal computers, or personal digital assistants (PDAs) may provide multimedia data through HTTP, FTP, or WAP, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Therefore, in step <b>206</b>, the name of multimedia data to be transmitted, moonriver.mp3 for example, is obtained from the multimedia data transmission request first, then the large amount of stored multimedia data is subsequently searched for so as to obtain the requested multimedia data. If the requested multimedia data is not found, then the terminal initiating the multimedia data transmission request will be notified and the flow will end.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In step <b>207</b>, the multimedia data is transmitted, while the call between the terminals is not interrupted.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">At this point, multimedia data which terminal 1 wishes to transmit may be simultaneously transmitted to terminals 1 and 2 while they are in a call. Upon receipt of the multimedia data, terminals 1 and 2 can play it using their own multimedia players. In this manner, subscribers to terminals 1 and 2 can listen to a song, watch video, or appreciate pictures without affecting the normal call.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Preferably, in step <b>208</b>, a multimedia data transmission stopping request is received from a terminal. The terminal requesting the stop of multimedia data transmission may be a terminal for which &#x201c;receive enabled/disabled&#x201d; has been enabled, a terminal that is receiving multimedia data, any one of these terminals, or even any one of terminals in the call.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, terminal 2 can edit, for example a SIP INFO message as illustrated below, and send it to a specific number associated with the multimedia communication device:</p>
