<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for metering liquid anhydrous ammonia at a manifold which simultaneously divides the ammonia equally among multiple injection locations and controls total ammonia flow to applicator injectors. The apparatus allows a wider range of rates than a manifold with fixed orifices. The apparatus also improves flow rate adjustment accuracy between injection locations.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Injection of anhydrous ammonia into the soil is a commonly used method of supplying nitrogen fertilizer to grain and other crops using an applicator vehicle pulled by a tractor. An ammonia storage tank is pulled behind the applicator. A hose connects the storage tank to the distribution system on the applicator. The distribution system splits the ammonia into separate lines which feed multiple knives. These knives are lowered into the soil several inches and ammonia is injected into the ground at the bottom of the knives as the knives are pulled through the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is normally desired that ammonia be applied uniformly over a field. One of the main problems in achieving this uniformity is difficulty in controlling a stream of mixed liquid and gaseous ammonia. Gaseous ammonia causes most flow sensors to supply incorrect data. Many anhydrous ammonia application systems use a heat exchanger to cool the ammonia flow from the storage tank to condense vapor which has been created by friction in the hose from a nurse tank.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Part of the liquid ammonia is used as a refrigerant to cool the inlet liquid stream. This is accomplished in a heat exchanger which mechanically separates the main stream of inlet liquid ammonia from a stream of coolant ammonia. Typically, the coolant stream is taken from the main stream after the heat exchanger. The coolant passes through a restriction and loses pressure and temperature before it enters coolant side of the heat exchanger. A portion of the coolant stream evaporates in the heat exchanger, taking heat from the main stream. This cools the main stream and condenses incoming ammonia vapor back to Liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Most current anhydrous ammonia application systems follow the heat exchanger with a flow sensor which measures the rate of flow of incoming liquid ammonia. After the flow sensor this flow goes through a servo valve which regulates the total flow rate. At the servo valve the anhydrous experiences a pressure drop which causes some of it to vaporize. The resulting mixture of liquid and vapor phases is not easily split among the multiple injection locations.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Crops such as corn are planted by planters with a selected space between rows. The spacing between rows varies depending upon a number of factors including crop to be grown, soil conditions, and hours of sun shine during the crop growing period. The applicator usually has the number of soil cutting knives required to apply ammonia to the number of rows planted by a planter during each pass through a field. With automated tractor guidance system employed by some farmers, the number of soil cutting knives on an ammonia applicator may not be limited by the number of planter row units on the planter. A large applicator tool bar may require multiple metering manifolds.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The method and apparatus of the present invention encompasses a manifold which divides anhydrous ammonia flow among multiple injection locations. The invention has five advantages over other manifolds currently in use. First, it divides the liquid stream of anhydrous from the flow meter equally among the multiple injection locations. Second, the invention, which acts as a servo valve, allows control of the total flow of the ammonia. Third, the invention allows a much wider range of rates than a manifold with fixed orifices. Fourth, the invention's wide range makes possible variable rate application across a field. Fifth, the invention may include solenoid valves on lines to each row, making possible control of overlapping &#x201c;point&#x201d; rows in fields with odd shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Design of a variable, multiple orifice manifold can be of several shapes. These shapes include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">1-disk shape with the orifices located around the circumference of the disk. An inside rotor (disk) has orifices of a given configuration and an outside housing (stator) has orifices of a different given configuration. As the rotor turns inside the stator, the two different orifice configurations relate to vary the open area between the orifices.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">2-disk shape with the orifices located in a circle around the face of the disk, concentric with the geometric center of the disk. An inside rotor (disk) has orifices of a given configuration and an outside housing (stator) has orifices of a different given configuration. As the rotor turns inside the stator, the two different orifice configurations relate to vary the open area between orifices.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">3-linear shape with the orifices located along concentric bars or rounds. An inside part, has orifices of a given configuration in a straight line along that part. An outside housing has orifices of a different given configuration in a straight line, on the same spacing. As the two parts move linearly in relation to each other, the two different orifice configurations relate to vary the open area between the orifices.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Design-1 is not desirable because of the difficulty of machining orifices in curved surfaces. Design 2 is the preferred embodiment for this patent because precision rotary actuators are readily available for moving the orifices relative to each other. A limiting factor in design of the manifold is a requirement that the connections to the injection points be far enough apart so that appropriate fittings can be installed. Another factor mandating a minimum distance between is the need for one of orifices to travel a significant distance in order to vary the net difference in overall orifice opening. Too short of a distance can prevent the actuating device from making precise adjustments.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">There is a multitude of geometries which can be defined for each set of orifices. The main requirement is that they can be machined in production. Another requirement is that the flow be proportional as the orifices move in relation to each other. Current manifold orifices generally have holes with diameters upward from 0.02 inches. The configuration and relation of orifices as an embodiment of this invention is:</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">1&#x2014;one set of orifices consists of round holes 0.160 inch diameter;</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">2&#x2014;the other set of orifices are slots transitioning from a hole of 0.03 inch diameter to a hole of 0.16 inch diameter;</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">3&#x2014;the rotor orifice slot has center distance between holes of about &#xbd; inch; and</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">4&#x2014;travel between the two sets of orifices is such that one end of travel, there is no common opening between the orifices. At the other end of travel there is maximum area open for flow through the set of orifices.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Since the variable orifices provide varying flow with a generally constant fluid pressure before the manifold, flow can be varied while maintaining the anhydrous ammonia as a liquid in the manifold. This is the prime requirement for maintaining equal flow among application rows.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Since there is a practical limit to the number of orifices that can be contained in a manifold, higher number of rows will utilize multiple synchronized manifolds.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The metering and distribution apparatus for anhydrous ammonia operates in a system with or without a mechanical pump. The flow of anhydrous ammonia through the apparatus is obtained by the vapor pressure of the anhydrous ammonia in a storage and supply tank. A heat exchanger may be employed to cool the anhydrous ammonia and prevent the formation of anhydrous ammonia vapors that could enter the metering and distribution apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The metering and distribution apparatus includes a body with an open top. The body includes a body cylindrical inside surface, a bottom wall and an anhydrous ammonia inlet in the bottom wall. A cover plate is clamped to the body to substantially close the open top and form a chamber. The chamber is defined by the cylindrical inside surface of the wall, the bottom wall and the cover plate.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A central bore through the cover plate has a bore axis that is coaxial with a body central axis and the body cylindrical inside surface. The bore axis is perpendicular to a chamber inside flat surface on the bottom wall.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A bearing counter bore is provided in an upper end of the central bore through the cover plate. A bearing is mounted in the bearing counter bore. A seal counter bore is provided in a lower end of the central bore through the cover plate. A seal is mounted in the seal counter bore. A drive shaft passes through the bearing and through the seal and into the chamber. The drive shaft has an axis of rotation that is coaxial with the body central axis. A motor mounted on cover plate outside of the chamber pivots the drive shaft to selected positions to control the flow rate of anhydrous ammonia.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A rotor is rotably fixed to the drive shaft and axially slidable on the drive shaft inside the chamber. The rotor has a radially outer surface that is spaced from the body cylindrical inside surface. A rotor bottom surface is parallel to and spaced from the chamber inside flat surface on the bottom wall. A plurality of inlet passages for anhydrous ammonia, pass through the rotor. The inlet passages are spaced from the shaft axis of rotation. The inlet passages through the rotor are in communication with a plurality of passages in the wall and the anhydrous ammonia inlet. The anhydrous ammonia inlet, the plurality of passages in the bottom wall and the plurality of inlet passages through the rotor cooperate to carry anhydrous ammonia into the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Each of a plurality of elongated orifices pass through the rotor from a rotor top surface to the rotor bottom surface. The elongated orifices are spaced from each other and radially, spaced inward from the rotor radially outer surface. Each of the plurality of elongated orifices includes a first cylindrical end arc with a first arc diameter and a second cylindrical end arc with a second arc diameter. The second arc diameter is smaller than the first arc diameter. A radially outer wall extends from the first cylindrical end arc to the second cylindrical end arc. A radially inner wall extends from the first cylindrical end arc to the second cylindrical end arc. An axis of the first cylindrical end arc and an axis of the second cylindrical end arc are positioned an equal distance from the shaft axis of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A plurality of discharge bores pass through the bottom wall of the body, are spaced apart from each other, and are spaced the same distance from the body central axis. Each of the plurality of discharge bores includes a discharge counter bore that is coaxial with the discharge bore. The discharge counter bore extends from the chamber to the discharge bore. A threaded counter bore is in communication with the discharge bore and extend out of the body. A resilient O-ring is mounted in the discharge counter bore adjacent to the discharge bore. A graphite tube is slidably received in the discharge counter bore. A graphite tube first end is in sealing engagement with a resilient O-ring. A graphite tube second end is in engagement with the rotor bottom surface. A tube bore passes through the graphite tube from the first end to the second end. The resilient O-ring urges the graphite tube toward the rotor. The rotor is axially urged toward the graphite tube parallel to the shaft axis of rotation to maintain engagement between the graphite tube second end and the rotor bottom surface. A spring is provided to urge the rotor toward the graphite tube second end.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref> depict embodiments of the apparatus of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The relation of the present invention to other components of an anhydrous ammonia applicator is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The apparatus of the present invention is shown being pulled behind a tow vehicle <b>100</b> which could be a tractor, truck, or the like. The apparatus includes a toolbar applicator frame <b>101</b> which supports a heat exchanger <b>102</b>, a total flow measurement system <b>103</b>, an electrically operated shut off valve <b>105</b>, a flow rate control valve <b>104</b>, a distribution and metering manifold <b>106</b>, a plurality of connecting tubes <b>115</b> each of which is connected to one of a plurality of soil cutting knives <b>107</b>. Multiple knives <b>107</b> are suspended from the toolbar applicator frame <b>101</b>, with there being eight or more of the knives <b>107</b> attached to a toolbar applicator frame, which is adapted to raise or lower the knives <b>107</b> into the soil. Each knife <b>107</b> includes at least one injector nozzle <b>117</b> through which the ammonia can be emitted into the soil when the knife <b>107</b> is lowered into the soil. A storage tank <b>108</b>, for anhydrous ammonia or other liquid fertilizer is supported on a plurality of wheels <b>109</b> and towed behind the toolbar applicator frame <b>101</b>. The toolbar applicator frame <b>101</b> itself is supported on a plurality of wheels <b>110</b> and has a tongue <b>118</b> that is pivotally connected to a hitch on the rear of the tow vehicle <b>100</b>. The storage tank <b>108</b> is a pressurized tank that is commercially available and retains a predetermined quantity of fertilizer which may be, by way of illustration, anhydrous ammonia. The storage tank <b>108</b> is on a trailer that also has a tongue <b>116</b> that is pivotally connected to a hitch on the toolbar applicator frame <b>101</b>. Liquid pressurized by gas in the storage tank flows from the tank to a tank shut off valve <b>111</b> and to an acme quick connector with a globe shut off valve <b>112</b>. Liquid then flows through a hose <b>113</b> to a breakaway coupling <b>114</b> and to the heat exchanger <b>102</b>. The flow sensor <b>103</b> is connected to a console/controller in the operator's cab <b>119</b> of the tow vehicle <b>100</b> so that the operator of the tow vehicle can monitor and control the flow of ammonia through a distribution and metering manifold <b>106</b>. The console/controller regulates the manifold <b>106</b>. At the manifold <b>106</b> the liquid ammonia is metered among the lines <b>115</b> to the multiple injection knives <b>107</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the toolbar applicator frame is a Progressive series 1300 NH3&#xae; Toolbar, manufactured by Progressive Farm, Products, Inc. of Hudson, Ill. It is configured by Progressive for &#x201c;strip till&#x201d; ammonia application</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> displays the mechanical components of the distribution and metering manifold <b>106</b> in a sectional view. The rotor <b>202</b> is slidably attached to the drive shaft <b>212</b> and rotates inside the body <b>201</b> of the manifold <b>106</b>. A key <b>290</b> prevents rotation of the rotor relative to the drive shaft <b>212</b>. A gear motor <b>211</b> drives the shaft <b>212</b> within a selected fixed range of a few degrees to as much as 45 degrees. The gear motor <b>211</b> is attached to the cover plate <b>203</b> by means of an interface plate <b>204</b>. The drive shaft <b>212</b> is journaled by a sealed ball or roller bearing <b>207</b>. The drive shaft <b>212</b> may also be journaled in a bushing <b>190</b> in the bore <b>205</b> in the body <b>201</b>. A lip seal <b>208</b> prevents passage of anhydrous ammonia to the sealed roller or ball bearing <b>207</b> and atmosphere. The lip seal <b>208</b> is constructed from a material compatible with anhydrous ammonia such as Teflon&#xae; or UHMW polyethylene. The cover plate <b>203</b> is sealed to the body <b>201</b> by flexible sealant or an appropriately placed O-ring. Bolts <b>120</b> clamp the cover plate <b>203</b> to the body <b>201</b>. A Belleville washer spring <b>206</b> on the drive shaft <b>212</b> urges the rotor <b>202</b> toward the bore base <b>210</b> of the chamber <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a partial cross section view of the distribution and metering manifold <b>106</b>. Anhydrous ammonia enters the manifold <b>106</b> through pipe <b>301</b>. Flow splits in the body <b>201</b> into several passages <b>302</b>. Flow continues through the rotor <b>202</b> through a plurality of passages <b>303</b> and into a chamber <b>304</b>. The chamber <b>304</b> is defined by the bore base <b>210</b>, the cylindrical wall surface <b>214</b>, and the bottom surface <b>216</b> of the cover plate <b>203</b>. The chamber <b>304</b> inside the manifold body <b>201</b> allows flow to orifices <b>305</b> in the rotor <b>202</b>. The chamber <b>304</b> is filled with anhydrous ammonia. The space between a flat bottom surface <b>260</b> of the rotor <b>202</b> and the floor of the chamber <b>304</b> in the body <b>201</b> also holds some anhydrous ammonia. Orifices <b>305</b> in the rotor <b>202</b> communicate with tube bores <b>246</b> in the graphite cylinders <b>240</b>. As the rotor <b>202</b> is rotated inside the body <b>201</b>, open area between the orifices <b>305</b> and the tube bores <b>246</b> varies from totally open to totally closed. Flow from individual orifice <b>305</b> and tube bore <b>246</b> pairs pass through fittings <b>307</b> and tubes <b>115</b> to individual knives or openers <b>107</b>. The fittings <b>307</b> may include nipples, elbows, a combination of nipples and elbows or other suitable tubing members. Optionally, at the fitting <b>307</b> to each knife <b>107</b>, an electrically operated solenoid valve can be installed which turns on and off flow to that knife, independent of the other knives. Master rate controllers such as Insight made by Ag leader Technology of Ames, Iowa and Greenstar, made by Deere &#x26; Company of Moline, Ill. have the capability of shutting off flow to individual lines <b>115</b>. These controllers provide the mechanical means to turn off flow to individual knives <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the embodiment shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the fully closed position <b>401</b> is shown at the 10 o'clock position. The fully open position <b>403</b> is shown at the 5 o'clock position while partially open positions are shown in the other locations, typified by position <b>402</b>. One end <b>405</b> of the slot <b>305</b> is located on the circle which is the locus of centers of the fixed orifices <b>306</b>. These orifices <b>306</b> correspond to the tube bores <b>246</b> in graphite tubes <b>240</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. The center of the arc is such that when the rotor <b>202</b> is in fully open position <b>403</b> for maximum flow, the end <b>405</b> of the arc is directly over the fixed orifice <b>306</b>. The center of the arc is such that when the rotor <b>202</b> is positioned in closed position <b>401</b> to shut off flow, the end <b>404</b> of the arc is completely offset from the fixed orifice <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the fully closed position <b>501</b> is shown at the 10 o'clock position. The fully open position <b>503</b> is shown at the 5 o'clock position while partially open positions are shown in the other locations, typified by partially open position <b>502</b>. The slots shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are tapered between two holes of different diameters. The slot end <b>504</b> has a 0.160 inch diameter. This end <b>504</b> of the slot is located on the circle which is the locus of centers of the fixed orifices <b>306</b>. The end <b>504</b> of the slot is such that when the rotor is in position <b>503</b> for maximum flow, the end <b>504</b> of the slot is directly over the fixed orifice <b>306</b>. The slot end <b>505</b> has a 0.0325 inch diameter. The end <b>505</b> of the slot is such that it is offset on a circle outside the circle of the locus of the centers of fixed orifices <b>306</b>. However, the arc at the end <b>505</b> of the slot is completely contained inside the circle of fixed orifices <b>306</b> when directly over the fixed orifice as shown at the 9 o'clock position. For both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> the rotor <b>202</b> moves in relation to the fixed orifices <b>306</b> so that at one end of travel there is no overlapping of the fixed orifices and the rotating slot <b>305</b>. At the other end of rotation, the orifices overlap so that there are maximum open areas through both the slot <b>305</b> in the rotor <b>202</b> and the orifices <b>306</b> in the body <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A minor flow of anhydrous ammonia between the rotor <b>202</b> bottom surface <b>260</b> and the bore base <b>210</b> in the body <b>201</b> is desirable. The flow of anhydrous ammonia through the entire chamber <b>304</b> will maintain a substantially uniform ammonia temperature. An unintended increase in temperature or decrease in pressure in the chamber <b>304</b> could result in some anhydrous ammonia changing from a liquid to a gas. The rotor flat bottom surface <b>260</b> of the rotor <b>202</b> is parallel to the bore base <b>210</b> of the body <b>201</b> of the manifold <b>106</b>. The rotor flat bottom surface <b>260</b> is also perpendicular to the axis of rotation <b>606</b> of drive shaft <b>212</b>. During operation, all of the orifices <b>305</b> in the rotor <b>202</b> are in the same position relative to an adjacent orifice <b>306</b> in the body <b>201</b> so that the flow through one tube bore <b>246</b> is the same as the flow through all the other tube bores.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The control of the flow path of anhydrous ammonia from chamber <b>304</b> and into each tubular line <b>115</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. This flow control includes a counter bore <b>230</b> in the body <b>201</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. A discharge bore <b>232</b> extends from the counter bore <b>230</b> to a threaded counter bore <b>234</b>. A fitting <b>307</b> is mounted in each threaded counter bore <b>234</b>. A tubular line <b>115</b> is secured to the fitting <b>307</b>. A resilient O-ring <b>238</b> is inserted into the bottom <b>236</b> of the counter bore <b>230</b>. A graphite tube <b>240</b> is positioned in the counter bore <b>230</b>. The graphite tube <b>240</b> has an outer cylindrical surface that engages the walls of the counter bore <b>230</b>. The graphite tube <b>240</b> is sized to be received in the counter bore <b>230</b> without force and to minimize radial movement. A first end <b>242</b> of the tube <b>240</b> contacts the O-ring <b>238</b>. The second end <b>244</b> of the tube <b>240</b> engages the rotor <b>202</b>. The rotor <b>202</b> exerts some force on the tube <b>240</b> to compress the O-ring <b>238</b>. The O-ring <b>238</b> maintains a seal between the first end <b>242</b> of the tube <b>240</b> and the bottom <b>236</b> of the counter bore <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The tube <b>240</b> is preferably made from graphite. Graphite may be formed by extrusion, or molding. Tube <b>240</b> may also be formed by machining a graphite block. The graphite members preferably have high density and strength. A fine surface finish and precision tolerances are obtainable by employing suitable grades of graphite. The end products are resistant to oxidation, have low levels of thermal expansion and are suitable for chemical process equipment. Graphite is also a suitable bearing material. A tube bore <b>246</b> through the tube <b>240</b> has a diameter of 0.160 inches for a maximum flow rate. An increased application rate may be obtained by decreasing the speed of the tow vehicle <b>100</b>. However a higher application rate may damage a crop. The size of the tube bore <b>246</b> may also be increased if needed. The size of other passages would need to be increased to correspond with the increased diameter of the tube bore <b>246</b>. Pressure drops in the system are avoided to prevent the formation of gas.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a rotor <b>602</b> with elongated orifices <b>605</b>. Each of the elongated orifices <b>605</b> has a cylindrical end arc <b>604</b> with a diameter of 0.160 inches. Each of the orifices <b>605</b> also has a cylindrical end arc <b>603</b> with a diameter of 0.0325 inches. The end arcs <b>604</b> and <b>603</b> of the orifices <b>605</b> have arc axes that are the same distance from an axis of rotation <b>606</b> of the rotor <b>602</b> and the drive shaft <b>212</b>. A cylindrical wall <b>608</b> of the rotor <b>602</b> is also coaxial with the axis of rotation <b>606</b>. The cylindrical wall <b>608</b> is spaced from a cylindrical inside wall <b>222</b> of the body <b>201</b> to permit the flow of anhydrous ammonia. The radially inner wall <b>610</b> and the radially outer wall <b>612</b> of each orifice <b>605</b> are arcs extending from an end arc <b>603</b> to an end arc <b>604</b>. One end of the radially outer wall <b>612</b> joins the radially outer portion of the end arc <b>604</b>. The other end of the radially outer wall <b>612</b> joins a radially outer portion of the end arc <b>603</b>. One end of the radially inner wall <b>610</b> joins the radially inner portion of the end arc <b>604</b>. The other end of the radially inner wall <b>610</b> joins a radially inner portion of the end arc <b>603</b>. The distance between radially outer wall <b>612</b> and the radially inner wall <b>610</b> decreases from end arc <b>604</b> to end arc <b>603</b> of each orifice <b>605</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The distance between the radially outer wall <b>612</b> and a circle about the axis of rotation <b>606</b> of the rotor <b>602</b> and passing through the axes of end arcs <b>603</b> and <b>604</b>, along a radius of the rotor, is equal to the distance between the radially inner wall <b>610</b> and the circle about the axis of rotation of the rotor along the same radius of the rotor. An axis of the tube bore <b>246</b> of each graphite cylinder <b>240</b> is midway between the radially outer wall <b>212</b> and the radially inner wall <b>610</b> when the tube bore <b>246</b> is in alignment with an elongated orifice <b>605</b>. This structure insures that the second end <b>244</b> of the graphite tube <b>240</b> engages the rotor <b>602</b> in each counter bore <b>230</b>, in at least two areas one hundred and eighty degrees (180&#xb0;) apart in any position between the end arc <b>603</b> and the end arc <b>604</b> of each elongated orifice <b>605</b>. This structure of the elongated orifice <b>605</b> eliminates bending loads on the graphite tube <b>240</b>. Bending loads due to movement between the rotor <b>602</b> and the graphite tubes <b>240</b> are small. The elimination of bending loads insures that the O-ring <b>238</b> is able to maintain adequate pressure between graphite tube <b>240</b> second end <b>244</b> and the rotor <b>602</b> during all settings of flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Movement of the second end <b>244</b> of each graphite tube <b>240</b> along the radially inner wall <b>610</b> and along the radially outer wall <b>612</b> of each elongated orifice <b>605</b>, during anhydrous ammonia flow rate adjustment, is facilitated by continuous engagement with rotor <b>602</b> on both sides of the elongated rotor orifices. The lubrication characteristics of graphite reduce friction forces between the rotor and <b>602</b> and the graphite tube <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The elongated orifice <b>605</b> in the rotor <b>602</b> provides maximum flow rate of anhydrous ammonia when the orifice end <b>604</b>, with a diameter of 0.160 inches, is in axial alignment with the second end <b>244</b> of the tube bore <b>246</b> through the graphite tube <b>240</b>. The diameter of the cylindrical end <b>604</b> of the elongated orifice <b>605</b> through the rotor <b>602</b>, the diameter of the tube bore <b>246</b> through the graphite tube <b>240</b> and the diameter of the discharge bore <b>232</b> through the body <b>201</b> are all the same. If a larger maximum flow is desired at times, it would be desirable to increase all three diameters. If a smaller maximum flow rate is desired it would be desirable to decrease the diameter of the tube bore <b>246</b> through the tube <b>240</b> the diameter of the discharge bore <b>232</b>, and the diameter of the orifice end <b>604</b> of the elongated orifice <b>605</b>. Changes in the diameter of flow passages relative to each other inside the metering manifold <b>106</b> may result in pressure drops and allow some ammonia to become a gas. Anhydrous ammonia should remain a liquid at least until it enters the lines <b>115</b> that carry ammonia to the soil cutting knives <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The flow rate is reduced, from a maximum flow rate, by rotating the rotor <b>202</b> to a position in which the elongated orifice <b>605</b> decreases the size of the opening into the second end <b>244</b> of the tube <b>240</b>. The gear motor <b>211</b> is energized to rotate the rotor <b>202</b> or <b>602</b>. The rate of change in the flow rate is substantially constant along the length of the inner wall <b>610</b> and the outer wall <b>612</b>, when the inner and outer walls are controlling the size of the entrance into the tubular bore <b>246</b>. The elongated orifice <b>605</b> remains full of anhydrous ammonia during operation to assists in insuring that only liquid passes through the tube bore <b>246</b> in the tube <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">There are thirteen elongated orifices <b>605</b> through the rotor <b>602</b> that cooperate with the thirteen body orifices or tube bores <b>246</b> through the graphite tubes <b>240</b> in the body <b>201</b> to meter anhydrous ammonia into the ground. These thirteen passages provide anhydrous ammonia for twelve rows of plants such as American corn. If the planter makes two parallel side by side passes through the field, one of the two outside lines <b>115</b> to a soil cutting knife <b>107</b> is closed by a valve that is not shown. The elongated orifices <b>605</b> extend at least twenty degrees (20&#xb0;) from end <b>603</b> to the end <b>604</b> about the axis of rotation <b>606</b>. This angle provides elongated orifices <b>605</b> with sufficient length to accurately dispense anhydrous ammonia and to completely shut off flow through the metering manifold <b>106</b> with ninety seven percent (97%) accuracy or better. The accuracy is important because too little as well as too much anhydrous ammonia can decrease crop yield. The gear motor <b>211</b> and the metering manifold <b>106</b> can change the application rate, while moving across a field, based on soil samples and the quantity of nitrogen stored in the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The elongated orifices <b>605</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> extend an angle <b>650</b> of twenty three degrees (23&#xb0;) from each end arc <b>603</b> to the other end arc <b>604</b> of each orifice. The longer the length of each orifice <b>605</b> the more accurate the application rate. There is a limit to the number of elongated orifices that can be provided at an equal radius from the center of a rotor <b>602</b>. The diameter of a rotor <b>602</b> could be increased to increase the length of each elongated orifice <b>605</b>. An increase in diameter increases the volume of the chamber <b>304</b> and my lead to the formation of gas.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The elongated orifices <b>605</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> in combination with the tube bore <b>246</b> through the graphite tube all provide substantially the same flow rate of anhydrous ammonia. All of the flow rates are adjusted together simultaneously by energizing the gear motor <b>211</b> to pivot the rotor <b>202</b>. For larger tool bars more than one distribution and metering manifold may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Radially inner elongated orifices <b>705</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> can be added if desired. However, the 23&#xb0; arc is shorter. The shorter total length of each elongated orifice <b>705</b>, with the same diameter ends <b>603</b> and <b>604</b> as the radially outer elongated orifices <b>605</b>, requires some modification to permit the same passage flow rate of liquid anhydrous ammonia as the radially outer elongated orifice.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The orifice cylinder tubes <b>240</b> could be made from a material other than graphite. Nylon&#xae; tubes have been tried. Nylon is generally a good bearing material. However it has been found that some liquids such as water and anhydrous ammonia is either absorbed or sticks to the Nylon&#xae;. The result is a smaller effective diameter of the tube bore <b>246</b>. The changes in the effective diameter of the tube bore <b>246</b> changes the flow rate of anhydrous ammonia through the tubes <b>240</b>. The change in effective diameter of the tube bores <b>246</b> through Nylon&#xae; tubes appears to vary from one tube to another. The graphite tubes <b>240</b> provide a substantially uniform flow rate when pressure and temperature in the chamber <b>304</b> are unchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The orifice cylinder tubes <b>240</b>, when used with the slot <b>305</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, do not have equal surface area on the second end <b>244</b> engaging the flat bottom surface <b>260</b> of a rotor <b>202</b> on both sides of the slot <b>305</b>. In some positions the second end <b>244</b> may be out of engagement with the flat bottom surface <b>260</b> on one side of the slot <b>305</b>. As a result, forces are exerted unevenly across the second end <b>244</b> of an orifice tube <b>240</b>. This uneven force on the second end <b>244</b> of each orifice cylinder tube <b>240</b> results in variations in flow rates through the tube bores <b>246</b> when the rotor <b>202</b> is in one selected position. The slots <b>705</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> provides substantly equal fluid flow rates through all of the tube bores <b>246</b> when the rotor <b>602</b> is any one of the selected positions.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The second end <b>244</b> of the tubes <b>240</b> wears during use. Due to the wear and other factors, it may be difficult to maintain a desired compression load on the resilient O-ring <b>238</b> and maintain a seal. To control the force exerted on the O-ring <b>238</b>, the rotor <b>202</b> or <b>602</b> is permitted so slide on the drive shaft <b>212</b> parallel to the axis <b>606</b> of rotation of the rotor. A key <b>290</b> prevents rotation between the drive shaft <b>212</b> and the rotor <b>202</b> or <b>602</b>. A spring <b>206</b> urges the rotor <b>202</b> or <b>602</b> toward the second ends <b>244</b> of the tubes <b>240</b> and controls the load on the resilient O-rings <b>238</b>. The spring <b>206</b> is two Belleville washers as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. The spring <b>206</b> could also be a coil spring.</p>
