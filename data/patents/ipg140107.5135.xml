<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A capability is provided for supporting a layered wireless network. A method for supporting a service session for a wireless user device includes receiving a service request associated with the wireless user device, determining at least one characteristic of the service request, and selecting, using the at least one characteristic of the service request, one of a plurality of network layers available for supporting a service session for the service request. A network layer has a wireless access technology associated therewith and, optionally, also may have a core network technology associated therewith. The selection of the network layer for a service request may be performed within the network or performed at the wireless user device under the control of the network.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates generally to wireless networks, more specifically but not exclusively, to providing layered wireless networks.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As wireless networks continue to evolve to &#x201c;anything to anything&#x201d; networks that support &#x201c;anything to anything&#x201d; traffic, wireless networks need to be able to transport many different types of traffic both efficiently and cost effectively. For example, such wireless networks need to be able to transport traffic ranging from high end data traffic (e.g., streaming video services, video conferencing/collaboration services, peer-to-peer services, and the like) to low end data traffic for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication (e.g., healthcare monitoring, meter reading, and the like), and everything in between. Disadvantageously, however, existing wireless networks are &#x201c;one size fits all&#x201d; networks that do not support efficient and cost-effective use of network resources for transporting such traffic and, thus, the cost of providing all services, and the treatment of all services irrespective of the type of service, is the same. As such, the cost of providing services with lower data requirements is relatively high compared to the cost of providing services with high data requirements. In addition, low data requirement services, if in large enough volume, can overload a network intended to provide high data service, and, thus, compromise quality of service for services with high data requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Furthermore, as wireless networks evolve to &#x201c;anything to anything&#x201d; type networks, many different traffic bottlenecks occur, thereby reducing the quality of service. First, in an &#x201c;anything to anything&#x201d; network, the amount of signaling that is performed in support of the &#x201c;anything to anything&#x201d; traffic continues to increase. The signaling overhead is significant, which uses resources in the network at a much higher rate than other types of traffic. This problem is further exacerbated as the numbers and types of services made available via the network increase, because spectrum becomes even more of a bottleneck. Second, in an &#x201c;anything to anything&#x201d; network, the amount of traffic through the core of the network is also greatly increased and bottlenecks in the core network will occur, especially with data intensive services, blocking the flow of traffic and greatly reducing quality of service. This has already been experienced with the iPhone, which is a 3G service, and 4G promises even higher increases in data traffic. As a result, service traffic (e.g., such as high speed, high bandwidth traffic supporting high value services) would need to be throttled back in order to free up capacity to support the associated signaling overhead or core network resources for these and other lower value services.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Additionally, while the foregoing problems are applicable to all types of wireless networks, these problems may be further exacerbated by other problems specific to different types of wireless networks. For example, traffic for M2M communication is short and bursty in nature, and does not require high bandwidth or great use of network resources. As a result, this type of traffic could be bundled together for more efficient network utilization. However, M2M networks are currently fragmented (primarily because M2M networks are operated by individual businesses for their own purposes) such that bundling of M2M traffic is not performed for a variety of reasons. First, most M2M networks are independent of service provider wireless networks, such that M2M traffic must be transported through one type of network independent of which type of network is capable of transporting the M2M traffic most efficiently (i.e., depending on the type of wireless technology being used by the service provider, such as CDMA, UMTS, LTE, and the like). Second, even lower-cost M2M networks, such as Zigbee, are not incorporated into or even interfaced with service provider wireless networks. Thus, since bundling of M2M traffic is not performed, the cost of transporting M2M traffic is greater than is necessary. Furthermore, as M2M traffic expands with increased &#x201c;anything to anything&#x201d; usage, the need for more robust and more efficient ways to carry M2M traffic will occur.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As such, a need exists for an improved capability for bundling and handling traffic in wireless networks.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A layered wireless network capability is depicted and described herein. The layered wireless network capability supports layering of a service provider network using a plurality of network layers to form thereby a layered wireless network. The layered wireless network capability supports provider-controlled selection of network layers to be used for supporting service sessions for end users. The network layers of a layered wireless network may be defined in any suitable manner, including embodiments in which each network layer of the layered wireless network is defined as a combination of a wireless access technology and a core network technology, as well as embodiments in which one or more network layers of the layered wireless network may be defined in one or more other ways. The network layers of the layered wireless network are composed of networks which facilitate the service sessions, including wireless access networks and associated core networks that support the wireless access networks.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The layered wireless network capability is provided using a network layer selection server configured for performing functions such as receiving service requests, selecting network layers for supporting service sessions in response to the service requests (e.g., where selection of network layers for supporting the service sessions is based on one or more characteristics of the service requests and network layer selection information), initiating signaling for enabling establishment of the service sessions for the service requests, initiating signaling for reconfiguring service sessions in response to changes in network layer selection information and/or in response to trigger conditions, and the like, as well as combinations thereof. The network layer selection server performs network layer selection using network layer selection information. The network layer selection information may be maintained as network layer selection policies configured for use in selecting network layers for service sessions in response to service requests. The network layer selection policies maintained at the network layer selection server may be determined using one or more of the following types of network layer selection information: network status information received from networks of which the network layers are composed, user preference information associated with users for which service sessions are requested, application preference information associated with applications for which service sessions are requested, and the like, as described herein. It will be appreciated that the foregoing is merely a general description of certain aspects of the layered wireless network capability and, thus, the embodiments of the layered wireless network capability are not intended to be limited based on this general description.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The layered wireless network capability enables a service provider to balance traffic across multiple network layers based on one or more of the type of traffic (e.g., where traffic of certain applications is better suited for being transported and/or is more efficiently transported via certain types of wireless access network technologies and/or core network technologies), the status of the underlying networks of which the network layers are composed (e.g., status of the wireless access networks and/or core networks), and the like, as well as combinations thereof. This provides the service provider with significant control over which service provider networks transport which types of traffic, thereby enabling service providers to use the wireless and core networks more efficiently and, thus, provide better quality of service to end users while at the same time reducing costs.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The foregoing description of features of the layered wireless network capability is provided for purposes of introducing the layered wireless network capability and, therefore, the embodiments of the layered wireless network capability are not intended to be limited based on the foregoing description of features of the layered wireless network capability.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Although primarily depicted and described herein with respect to use of wireless access networks to form the network layers, it will be appreciated that one or more of the network layers of the layered wireless network may include wireline access networks and, thus, that the layered wireless network also may be referred to more generally herein as a layered network and, similarly, that the layered wireless network capability also may be referred to more generally herein as a layered network capability.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an exemplary communication system including a layered wireless network.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, exemplary communication system (CS) <b>100</b> includes a layered wireless network (LWN) <b>110</b> including a plurality of networks <b>112</b> (which, illustratively, include a plurality of wireless access networks (WANs) <b>112</b><sub>W </sub>and a plurality of core networks (CNs) <b>112</b><sub>C</sub>, which provide a plurality of network layers (NLs)), a wireless user device (WUD) <b>120</b>, a plurality of application servers (ASs) <b>130</b> (which, illustratively, include a plurality of service provider ASs <b>130</b><sub>S </sub>and a plurality of third-party ASs <b>130</b><sub>T</sub>) and a network layer selection server (NLSS) <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The networks <b>112</b> include a plurality of WANs <b>112</b><sub>W</sub>, including a Long Term Evolution (LTE) WAN <b>112</b><sub>W1</sub>, a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)/Evolution-Data Optimized (EVDO) WAN <b>112</b><sub>W2</sub>, a Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) WAN <b>112</b><sub>W3</sub>, a Zigbee WAN <b>112</b><sub>W4</sub>, and a Broadcast WAN <b>112</b><sub>W5 </sub>(e.g., a Digital Video Broadcasting-Handheld (DVB-H) network, a Digital Video Broadcasting-Satellite Services to Handhelds (DVB-SH) network, a MediaFLO network, and the like). Although primarily depicted and described with respect to specific WANs <b>112</b><sub>W</sub>, it will be appreciated that fewer or more WANs <b>112</b><sub>W </sub>may be used to form LWN <b>110</b> and, similarly, different types of WANs <b>112</b><sub>W </sub>may be used to form LWN <b>110</b>. For example, a service provider may use a 4G wireless access technology other than LTE in place of the LTE WAN <b>112</b><sub>W1 </sub>or in addition to the LTE WAN <b>112</b><sub>W1</sub>. For example, a service provider may use a 3G wireless access technology other than CDMA/EVDO in place of CDMA/EVDO WAN <b>112</b><sub>W2 </sub>or in addition to CDMA/EVDO WAN <b>112</b><sub>W2 </sub>(e.g., using one or more of a Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) based WAN, an Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) based WAN, and the like). Thus, it will be appreciated that the WANs <b>112</b><sub>W </sub>depicted and described herein are merely exemplary, for purposes of describing the layered wireless network capability, and that any suitable numbers and types of radio access technologies may be used to provide a layered wireless network.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The networks <b>112</b> include a plurality of CNs <b>112</b><sub>C</sub>, including an Evolved Packet Core (EPC) CN <b>112</b><sub>C1</sub>, a Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) Core CN <b>112</b><sub>C2</sub>, and a Wired Core CN <b>112</b><sub>C3</sub>. Although primarily depicted and described with respect to specific CNs <b>112</b><sub>C</sub>, it will be appreciated that fewer or more CNs <b>112</b><sub>C </sub>may be used to form LWN <b>110</b> and, similarly, different types of CNs <b>112</b><sub>C </sub>may be used to form LWN <b>110</b>. For example, a service provider may use a 4G core technology other than EPC in place of EPC CN <b>112</b><sub>C1 </sub>or in addition to EPC CN <b>112</b><sub>C1</sub>. For example, a service provider may use a 3G core technology other than 3GPP2 Core in place of 3GPP2 Core CN <b>112</b><sub>C2 </sub>or in addition to 3GPP2 Core CN <b>112</b><sub>C2</sub>. For example, the Wired Core CN <b>112</b><sub>C3 </sub>may be any wired network suitable for supporting wired communications for WANs <b>112</b><sub>W </sub>such as WiFi WAN <b>112</b><sub>W3</sub>, Zigbee WAN <b>112</b><sub>W4</sub>, Broadcast WAN <b>112</b><sub>W5</sub>, and the like, as well as combinations thereof. As such, it will be appreciated that the CNs <b>112</b><sub>C </sub>depicted and described herein are merely exemplary, for purposes of describing the layered wireless network capability, and that any suitable numbers and types of core network technologies may be used to provide a layered wireless network.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, each of the networks <b>112</b> includes one or more network APIs/agents <b>113</b> deployed therein. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, WANs <b>112</b><sub>W1</sub>-<b>112</b><sub>W5 </sub>include a plurality of WAN APIs/agents <b>113</b><sub>W1</sub>-<b>113</b><sub>W5 </sub>(collectively, WAN APIs/agents <b>113</b><sub>W</sub>) and CNs <b>112</b><sub>C1</sub>-<b>112</b><sub>C5 </sub>include a plurality of CN APIs/agents <b>113</b><sub>C</sub>-<b>113</b><sub>C3 </sub>(collectively, CN APIs/agents <b>113</b><sub>C</sub>). The WAN APIs/agents <b>113</b><sub>W </sub>and CN APIs/agents <b>113</b><sub>C </sub>may be referred to collectively herein as network APIs/agents <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In this embodiment, network APIs/agents <b>113</b> may be deployed within networks <b>112</b>, respectively, in any suitable manner, e.g., using any suitable network elements within networks <b>112</b>. For example, the network API/agent <b>113</b><sub>W1 </sub>associated with LTE WAN <b>112</b><sub>W1 </sub>may be deployed on one or more of the eNodeBs or other network elements of the LTE WAN <b>112</b><sub>W1</sub>. For example, network API/agent <b>113</b><sub>W2 </sub>associated with CDMA/EVDO WAN <b>112</b><sub>W2 </sub>may be deployed on one or more of the base stations (BSs), base station routers (BSRs), base station controller (BSCs), and/or other network elements of the CDMA/EVDO WAN <b>112</b><sub>W2</sub>. For example, the network API/agent <b>113</b><sub>C1 </sub>associated with EPC CN <b>112</b><sub>C1 </sub>may be deployed on one or more of the PDN Gateway (PGW), the Serving Gateway (SGW), the Mobility Management Entity (MME), and the like, as well as combinations thereof. It will be appreciated that one skilled in the art would understand deployment options for deployment of network APIs/agents <b>113</b> within other networks <b>112</b> for which specific deployment examples are not provided.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this embodiment, the network APIs/agents <b>113</b> may provide various functions for networks <b>112</b> in support of the layered wireless network capability.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The network APIs/agents <b>113</b> may facilitate communications between networks <b>112</b> and NLSS <b>140</b>. For example, the networks APIs/agents <b>113</b> may facilitate communications between networks <b>112</b> and NLSS <b>140</b> for one or more of providing network state information to NLSS <b>140</b> for use by NLSS <b>140</b> in selecting NLs for service sessions, for receiving network configuration information from NLSS <b>140</b> and distributing network configuration information within the networks <b>112</b> (e.g., for use in configuring network elements of the networks <b>112</b> to support service sessions based on selection of NLs for the service sessions), and the like, as well as combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The network APIs/agents <b>113</b> may facilitate communications between networks <b>112</b>. For example, the networks APIs/agent <b>113</b> of networks <b>112</b> may facilitate communications between networks <b>112</b> for reconfiguring service sessions in response to instructions from NLSS <b>140</b> (e.g., where an existing service session is moved from one NL to another NL, where an existing service session is supplemented with a new service session, and the like, as well as combinations thereof). The network APIs/agents <b>113</b> may facilitate communications between networks <b>112</b> for any other suitable purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The network APIs/agents <b>113</b> also may be configured for facilitating adaptation of services to the NL being used for the services (e.g., to provide content adaptation according to the NL being used for the service session or performing other similar adaptations which may depend on the type of service being provided). This may be used in addition to or in place of service adaptation provided by the applications, such as where an application does not support such service adaptation.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The network APIs/agents <b>113</b> may provide other functions for networks <b>112</b> in support of the layered wireless network capability.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Although depicted and described with respect to an embodiment in which each network <b>112</b> includes one or more network APIs/agents <b>113</b>, it will be appreciated that in other embodiments only a subset of the networks <b>112</b> will include associated network APIs/agents <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The WANs <b>112</b><sub>W </sub>and CNs <b>112</b><sub>C </sub>are interconnected using a plurality of network communication paths (NCPs) <b>114</b><sub>A</sub>-<b>114</b><sub>F </sub>(collectively, NCPs <b>114</b>). As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, NCPs <b>114</b> include a NCP <b>114</b><sub>A </sub>between LTE WAN <b>112</b><sub>W1 </sub>and EPC CN <b>112</b><sub>C1</sub>, a NCP <b>114</b><sub>B </sub>between CDMA/EVDO WAN <b>112</b><sub>W2 </sub>and EPC CN <b>112</b><sub>C1</sub>, a NCP <b>114</b><sub>C </sub>between CDMA/EVDO WAN <b>112</b><sub>W2 </sub>and 3GPP2 Core CN <b>112</b><sub>C2</sub>, a NCP <b>114</b><sub>D </sub>between WiFi WAN <b>112</b><sub>W3 </sub>and Wired Core CN <b>112</b><sub>C3</sub>, a NCP <b>114</b><sub>E </sub>between Zigbee WAN <b>112</b><sub>W4 </sub>and Wired Core CN <b>112</b><sub>C3</sub>, and a NCP <b>114</b> between Broadcast WAN <b>112</b><sub>W5 </sub>and Wired Core CN <b>112</b><sub>C3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The LWN <b>110</b> provides a set of network layers (NLs) available for selection to support service sessions for WUD <b>120</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, although LWN <b>110</b> includes only five WANs <b>112</b><sub>W</sub>, LWN <b>110</b> actually supports six NLs, as indicated by the six NCPs (illustratively, NCPs <b>114</b>) which may be used to support service sessions. Although LWN <b>110</b> is primarily depicted and described herein with respect to specific numbers of WANs and CNs supporting specific numbers of NLs, LWN <b>110</b> is not limited to any particular number of WANs, CNs, or NLs. The LWN <b>110</b> may include any number of WANs and any number of CNs, which may be connected in any number of ways, and, thus, LWN <b>110</b> may include any number of NLs. The layered wireless network capability is not limited to any particular numbers NLs, any particular WAN technologies, any particular CN technologies, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The NLSS <b>140</b> controls selection of NLs for service sessions based, at least in part, on network layer selection information available to NLSS <b>140</b>. The operation of NLSS <b>140</b> in selecting NLs to support service sessions for WUD <b>120</b> may be better understood by first considering the capabilities of WUD <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The WUD <b>120</b> may be any wireless user device, such as a computer, a Mobile Internet Device (MID), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a data card, a smartphone, a phone, a medical monitoring device, a meter reading device, and the like. The WUD <b>120</b> is configured for communicating using multiple wireless access technologies.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The WUD <b>120</b> includes a plurality of network interface modules (NIMs) <b>122</b>, including an LTE NIM <b>122</b><sub>1 </sub>configured for accessing the LTE WAN <b>112</b><sub>W1</sub>, a CDMA/EVDO NIM <b>122</b><sub>2 </sub>configured for accessing the CDMA/EVDO WAN <b>112</b><sub>W2</sub>, a WiFi NIM <b>122</b><sub>3 </sub>configured for accessing the WiFi WAN <b>122</b><sub>W3</sub>, a Zigbee NIM <b>122</b><sub>4 </sub>configured for accessing the Zigbee WAN <b>112</b><sub>W4</sub>, and a Broadcast NIM <b>122</b><sub>5 </sub>configured for accessing the Broadcast WAN <b>112</b><sub>W5</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It will be appreciated that NIMs <b>122</b> of WUD <b>120</b> may be implemented in any suitable manner. In one embodiment, for example, different chip sets may be included within WUD <b>120</b> for each of the different access technologies to be supported by WUD <b>120</b>, thereby enabling the WUD <b>120</b> to access the multiple access technologies. In one embodiment, for example, a single chip set supporting multiple access technologies may be included within WUD <b>120</b> for enabling the WUD <b>120</b> to access the multiple access technologies. It will be appreciated that use LWN <b>110</b> by WUD <b>120</b> is not intended to be limited by the manner in which access to the access networks is provided at WUD <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It will be appreciated that, although primarily depicted and described with respect to specific NIMs <b>122</b> supporting specific types of wireless access technologies, fewer or more NIMs <b>122</b> may be included within WUD <b>120</b> and, similarly, different types of NIMs <b>122</b> supporting different wireless access technologies may be included within WUD <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It will be appreciated that the numbers and types of NIMs included within a WUD may vary both for the same types of wireless user devices (e.g., depending on the types of NIMs that different manufacturers of wireless user devices choose to include within the wireless user devices, and other similar factors) and for different types of wireless user devices.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It will be appreciated that the level of control by the service provider over the NLs selected for supporting service sessions for a particular WUD will depend on the numbers and types of wireless access technologies supported by the WUD (e.g., a WUD supporting a larger number of wireless access technologies will have more options as to the wireless access networks that can be accessed and, thus, the service provider will have more options as to the network layers which may be selected to service sessions for the WUD).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The WUD <b>120</b> includes a network layer selection agent (NLSA) module <b>124</b>. The NLSA <b>124</b> is configured for operating as an interface between each of the NIMs <b>122</b> and higher layers on WUD <b>120</b>, including applications on WUD <b>120</b> that will communicate via the NIMs <b>122</b> (omitted for purposes of clarity).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The NLSA <b>124</b> is configured for selecting which of the NIMs <b>122</b> to use for a service session, although the initial NIM <b>122</b> selected by NLSA <b>124</b> for a service session may be changed by NLSS <b>140</b> via selection of a NL that uses a different WAN <b>112</b> W than is used by the initial NIM <b>122</b> selected by NLSA <b>124</b> for the service session.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The NLSA <b>124</b> may be configured for selecting between NIMs <b>122</b> using known techniques (e.g., selecting to communicate via the WiFi NIM <b>122</b><sub>3 </sub>in response to instruction by a user, selecting to communicate via the WiFi NIM <b>122</b><sub>3 </sub>when within range of a WiFi wireless access point (WAP), selecting to communicate via LTE NIM <b>122</b><sub>1 </sub>when within range of an LTE access point, and the like, as well as combinations thereof).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The NLSA <b>124</b> also may be configured for selecting between NIMs <b>122</b> based on behavioral information for the WUD <b>120</b>. The behavioral information for the WUD <b>120</b> may be stored on WUD <b>120</b>, stored on NLSS <b>140</b>, and the like, as well as combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The NLSA <b>124</b> also may be configured for selecting between NIMs <b>122</b> under the control of NLSS <b>140</b> (e.g., in response to control signals from NLSS <b>140</b> that instruct WUD <b>120</b> as to which NIM(s) to use for a particular service session(s), using network layer selection information received from NLSS <b>140</b>, and the like, as well as combinations thereof). In this manner, NLSS <b>140</b> is able to control which NL(s) of LWN <b>110</b> is used by WUD <b>120</b> for a service session(s) established in response to a service request.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In one embodiment, the application APIs/agents <b>131</b> may include layering control APIs/agents. A layering control API/agent of an application enables the application to perform functions associated with network layer control, such as: requesting NL preferences (e.g., by providing network layer preference information to NLSS <b>140</b> for use by NLSS <b>140</b> in selecting NLs for service sessions for the application); requesting one or more special services (e.g., requests to receive layer-aware feedback, requests for multiple IP connections for the application, and the like); receiving, from the NLSS <b>140</b> and/or from WUD <b>120</b>, network layer capability information associated with the NL(s) being used to provide service sessions for WUD <b>120</b>; and the like, as well as combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In one embodiment, the application APIs/agents <b>131</b> include bearer processing APIs/agents.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">For example, a bearer processing API/agent of an application enables the application to perform bearer processing functions. In one embodiment, for example, the bearer processing functions may include identification of applications in order to assess treatment of the applications by NLSS <b>140</b> (e.g., selection of NLs used to provide service sessions for the applications). For example, NLSS <b>140</b> may easily identify applications that are known to NLSS <b>140</b>, e.g., applications of the service provider or applications of third-party application providers for which the applications have been registered with the service provider, in any suitable manner (e.g., where each application has an identifier associated therewith and any service request associated with the application includes the associated identifier for use by NLSS <b>140</b> in identifying the application, or using any other suitable application identification capabilities). For example, NLSS may not be able to easily identify applications that are unknown to NLSS <b>140</b> (e.g., applications of third-party application providers that have not registered with the service provider), in which case the NLSS <b>140</b> may need to perform additional processing in order to identify applications that are not known to the service provider (e.g., by identifying an IP address associated with the service request and using the IP address to identify the application, using deep packet inspection (DPI) to identify the application, and the like, as well as combinations thereof).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">For example, a bearer processing API/agent of an application may adapt services to the capabilities of the NL being used to provide the service (e.g., adapting content to the capabilities of the NL being used to transport the service or any other similar types of adaptation which may be supported).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">For example, a bearer processing API/agent of an application may handle multiple IP interfaces to an access device.</p>

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The network layer selection information may include one or more of service provider policies, network state information, user preference information, application preference information, and the like, as well as combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The service provider policies specify service provider preferences and/or requirements regarding use of network layers of LWN <b>110</b> to support service sessions. The service provider policies may be specified on one or more of a per-application-type basis, a per-application basis, a per-device-type basis, a per-user-profile basis, a per-service-session basis, and the like, as well as combinations thereof. Therefore, selection of network layers for service sessions may be performed on one or more of a per-application-type basis, a per-application basis, a per-device-type basis, a per-user-profile basis, a per-service-session basis, and the like, as well as combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the service provider policies may be the base policies for controlling network layer selection, which may then be modified based on other types of network layer selection information. The service provider policies may be dynamically modified. The service provider policies may be received from any suitable source of such information and, similarly, may be formatted in any manner suitable for maintaining and using such information.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The network state information includes any information indicative of the states of the networks <b>112</b> of which the NLs are composed. The network state information for a network <b>112</b> may include any information suitable for use in network layer selection. For example, network state information for a network <b>112</b> may include congestion information indicative of congestion within the network <b>112</b>, network capability information indicative of the capabilities of the network to support certain services, and the like, as well as combinations thereof. The network state information of a network <b>112</b> may be received from any suitable source of such information (e.g., from one or more network elements of the network <b>112</b> (which may depend on the type of network <b>112</b> from which the network state information is received), from a management system responsible for providing management functions for the network <b>112</b>, and the like, as well as combinations thereof). The network state information may be received in any suitable manner, e.g., at any suitable time, in any suitable format, and the like. In one embodiment, NLSS <b>140</b> may receive the network state information from network APIs/agents deployed within each of the networks <b>112</b> (illustratively, network APIs/agents <b>113</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The user preference information includes information indicative of preferences of users of WUDs accessing LWN <b>110</b>. The user preference information may include any user-related information suitable for use in performing network layer selection. For example, user preference information may include user preferences regarding network layers which are used, user preferences regarding the quality of service desired or required by the user, information associated with Service Level Agreements (SLAs) agreed upon by the user and the service provider, and the like, as well as combinations thereof. The user preference information may be specified on one or more of a per-application-type basis, a per-application basis, a per-device basis, a per-service-session basis, and the like, as well as combinations thereof. In one embodiment, user preference information will be accepted for all users, or at least those users that want to provide such information. In one embodiment, user preference information will only be accepted for preferred users which will pay a premium to have greater control over the network layer selection process for their service sessions and, optionally, to have an agreed upon SLA with the service provider. The user preference information for a user may be received from any suitable source of such information (e.g., from a Home Subscriber Server (HSS) and/or other suitable network device, from the user via the WUD, and the like, as well as combinations thereof). The user preference information for a user may be received in any suitable manner, e.g., at any suitable time, in any suitable format, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The behavioral characteristic information includes information indicative of behavior of users of WUDs and/or the WUDs in accessing LWN <b>110</b>. The behavioral characteristic information may include any behavioral information suitable for use in performing network layer selection. For example, behavioral characteristic information may include indications of the types of wireless access networks expected to be available to the WUDs (e.g., on certain days of the week, at certain times of day, and the like), types of applications that are expected to be used to access certain services, and the like, as well as combinations thereof. In other words, the behavioral characteristics information may include any information related to the behavior of the users of WUDs and/or the WUDs which may be used to perform network selection. The behavioral characteristic information may be determined in any suitable manner, e.g., using one or more behavior tracking algorithms developed for learning such behavioral characteristics and tracking changes to behavioral characteristics over time. In one embodiment, behavior tracking algorithms may be used to dynamically track user information for users and make inferences based on the user information to form thereby the behavioral characteristic information which may be used to perform network layer selection for the users. For example, behavior tracking algorithms may track the types of wireless networks available to the user at certain times (e.g., certain days of the week, certain times of day, and the like). As an example, behavior tracking algorithms may determine that, on weekdays, between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM a user only has access to cellular wireless networks (e.g., as the user drives to work), between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM the user has access to both a WiFi network and cellular networks (e.g., while at work), between 5:00 PM and 6:00 PM a user only has access to cellular wireless networks (e.g., as the user drives back home), and so forth. For example, behavior tracking algorithms may track the applications accessed by the user most frequently and the times at which the applications are most likely to be accessed. It will be appreciated that these are merely a few examples of the types of user information that may be tracked, inferences that may be drawn, and resulting behavioral characteristic information that may be determined using behavior tracking algorithms and, thus, any suitable behavior tracking algorithm(s) may be developed and used for determining any behavioral characteristic information suitable for use in selecting network layers for the user in response to service requests.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In one embodiment, at least a portion of the behavioral characteristic information may be maintained as part of one or more network layer selection policies, which also may include maintaining one or more behavior tracking algorithms as part of one or more network layer selection policies such that the behavior tracking algorithms evolve over time as the tracked behavior evolves. The behavioral characteristic information may be specified on one or more of a per-application-type basis, a per-application basis, a per-device basis, a per-user basis, per-WUD basis and the like, as well as combinations thereof. In one embodiment, behavioral characteristic information will be accepted for all users, or at least those users that want to provide such information. The behavioral characteristic information may be received from any suitable source of such information. For example, the behavioral characteristic information may be received from a network element (e.g., locally from NLSS <b>140</b>, remotely from a network element such as a Home Subscriber Server (HSS), and/or from any other suitable network element), from the user via the WUD, and the like, as well as combinations thereof. The behavioral characteristic information may be received in any suitable manner, e.g., at any suitable time, in any suitable format, and the like. The behavioral characteristic information associated with a user enables selection of network layers in response to service requests from the user on the basis of any information related to the behavioral characteristic information that is maintained for the user (e.g., based on one or more of the given situation, location, application, and the like, as well as combinations thereof).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The application preference information includes information indicative of preferences of applications providing services to WUDs via LWN <b>110</b>. The application preference information may include any application-related information suitable for use in performing network layer selection. For example, application preference information may include information indicative of the preferences of applications as to which network layer(s) is used for service sessions for the applications, information associated with business agreements and the manner in which service sessions are provided according based on the business agreements, and the like, as well as combinations thereof. In a case in which an application specifies multiple network layers which may be used for service sessions using the application, application preference information for the application may specify the multiple network layers in priority order. The application preference information may be specified on one or more of a per-device-type basis, a per-user basis, and the like, as well as combinations thereof. The application preference information for an application may be received from any suitable source of such information (e.g., from an application server hosting the application and/or from any other suitable source). The application preference information for an application may be received in any suitable manner, e.g., at any suitable time, in any suitable format, and the like.</p>

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">As an example, where network selection policies are specified on a per-behavioral-characteristics basis, a network layer selection policy may be set and maintained based on behavioral characteristics (as opposed to, or in addition to being based on the preferences of the service provider). For example, a network layer selection policy based on behavior characteristics may be set such that, when a user enters an area in which a WiFi connection is typically available, and the network layer selection policy recognizes that the user traditionally remains in that WiFi area for a sufficiently long period of time to make the conversion to WiFi feasible (e.g., the user is at home, at a library, and the like), then the network layer selection policy will move the user to that WiFi network (e.g., moving the WUD from the NL including CDMA/EVDO WAN <b>112</b><sub>W2 </sub>and 3GPP2 Core CN <b>112</b><sub>C2 </sub>to the NL including WiFi WAN <b>112</b><sub>W3 </sub>and Wired CN <b>112</b><sub>C3</sub>). As described herein, behavioral characteristics also may be specified for specific applications, locations, and the like, as well as combinations thereof. The behavioral characteristic information associated with a user enables selection of network layers in response to service requests from the user on the basis of any information related to the behavioral characteristic information that is maintained for the user (e.g., based on one or more of the given situation of the user, location of the user, application request by or on behalf of the user, and the like, as well as combinations thereof).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Although specific examples are provided for purposes of clarity in describing types of network layer selection policies which may be used, it will be appreciated that network layer selection policies may be specified in any suitable manner in accordance with the embodiments depicted and described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The NLSS <b>140</b> receives a service request for establishment of a service session for WUD <b>120</b>. The NLSS <b>140</b> may receive the service request from WUD <b>120</b> and/or from the network (e.g., in the case of a service initiated by the network, such as for push services or other types of services which may be initiated by the network).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The NLSS <b>140</b> determines one or more characteristics of the service request.</p>

<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In one embodiment, the one or more characteristics of the service request include one or more application-related characteristics of the service request. For example, the one or more application-related characteristics may include an application-type of the service request, an application of the service request, and the like, as well as combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In one embodiment, the one or more characteristics of the service request include one or more user-related characteristics associated with the user with which the service request is associated. For example, the one or more user-related characteristics may include a device-type of the WUD of the user, an indication of a subscription level associated with the user (e.g., such as whether or not the user subscribes to a bronze, silver, or gold level service), a current situation of the user, a current location of the user, and the like, as well as combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In one embodiment, the one or more characteristics of the service request include one or more device-related characteristics of the WUD with which the service request is associated. For example, the one or more device-related characteristics may include a device-type of the WUD with which the service request is associated, a device of the WUD with which the service request is associated (e.g., where a per-user network layer selection policy may be supported), and the like, as well as combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In one embodiment, the one or more characteristics of the service request include one or more SLA-related characteristics associated with an SLA under which the requested service is to be provided. For example, the one or more SLA-related characteristics may include a minimum data rate that must be supported for the requested service, a maximum delay that cannot be exceeded for the requested service, and the like, as well as combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The one or more characteristics of the service request may include any other characteristics suitable for use in performing network layer selection, which may be dependent on the basis upon which network layer selection may be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In one embodiment, while a service request may have multiple characteristics associated therewith, only the characteristic(s) necessary for use in performing network layer selection for the service request may be determined. In one embodiment, for example, in which network layer selection is performed based on an application-type of the service request, the application-type of the service request is determined. In one embodiment, for example, in which network layer selection is performed based on an application of the service request, the application of the service request is determined. In one embodiment, for example, in which network layer selection is performed based on both an application-type and a device-type of the service request, the application-type and the device-type of the service request is determined.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The characteristic(s) of the service request may be determined in any suitable manner, such as from a message or portion of a message that is transporting the service request, by querying one or more devices using information from a message or portion of a message that is transporting the service request, and the like, as well as combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In one embodiment, for example, in which a received service request is associated with an application that is provided by the service provider, NLSS <b>140</b> may be able to determine the application-related characteristic(s) of the service request directly from information included within service request.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In one embodiment, for example, in which a received service request is associated with an application that is not provided by the service provider or not known by the service provider (e.g., the application of the service request is an application of a third-party application provider), NLSS <b>140</b> may not be able to determine the application-related characteristic(s) of the service request directly from information included within the service request. In one such embodiment, the NLSS <b>140</b> may determine the application-related characteristic(s) of the service request by performing additional processing using information included within the service request. For example, NLSS <b>140</b> may determine the destination IP address of an application server for which the service request is intended and use the determined destination IP address of the application server to determine the application-related characteristic(s) of the service request. For example, NLSS <b>140</b> may use deep packet inspection on the payload of a received packet in order to determine the application-related characteristic(s) of the service request. In such embodiments, the additional processing used to determine the application-related characteristic(s) of the service request may be used to determine the type of the application, to specifically identify the application, and the like, as well as combinations thereof. In such embodiments, the application-related characteristic(s) of the service request may be determined using information available on NLSS <b>140</b> (e.g., by querying a local lookup table on NLSS <b>140</b>) and/or using information obtained by NLSS <b>140</b> from one or more remote sources of such information (e.g., by using information extracted from or associated with the service request to query the application server, to query a remote repository of application identification information, and the like, as well as combinations thereof). In such embodiments, processing of information of a service request for determining the application-related characteristic(s) of the service request may be performed by NLSS <b>140</b> in any suitable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The NLSS <b>140</b> selects one or more NLs of LWN <b>110</b> for the service request using the characteristic(s) of the service request and the network layer selection information.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In one embodiment, for example, in which the network layer selection information is maintained as network layer selection profiles and where at least one of the profiles is associated with an application-type, NLSS <b>140</b>, upon receiving a service request, determines an application-type associated with the service request and selects one of the network layer selection profiles based on the application-type of the service request.</p>

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In one embodiment, for example, in which the network layer selection information is maintained as network layer selection profiles and where at least one of the profiles is associated with a specific user (e.g., where the network layer selection profile is based on one or more of user preferences, behavioral characteristics, and the like), NLSS <b>140</b>, upon receiving a service request, determines the user associated with the service request and selects the network layer selection profile associated with that user.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In some such embodiments, the network layer selection policy may already be configured to account for network layer selection information such as network state, user preferences, behavioral characteristics, application preferences, and the like. In this case, selection of the one of the network layer selection policies associated with the application type of the service request results in selection of the NL(s) for the service request without a need to perform additional processing of network layer selection information upon selection of the network layer selection policy (although such additional processing may be performed as necessary or desired, such as where a portion of the network layer selection information is covered by the network layer selection policies and a portion of the network layer selection information is not covered by the network layer selection policies).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In other such embodiments, the network layer selection policy may not already be configured to account for network layer selection information such as network state, user preferences, behavioral characteristics, application preferences, and the like (e.g., the network layer selection policies merely include service provider preference information indicative of the network layers the service provider would like to use to transport traffic from application types). In this case, selection of the one of the network layer selection policies associated with the application type of the service request results in an initial selection of the NL(s) for the service request, however, processing of additional network layer selection information by NLSS <b>140</b> may result in modification of the NL(s) ultimately selected for the service request (e.g., such as where service provider preferences regarding the use of network layers are overridden based on network layer selection information such as network state, user preferences, behavioral characteristics, application preferences, and the like, as well as combinations thereof).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">As such, although primarily depicted and described herein with respect to embodiments in which the characteristic(s) of a service request is used to select a network layer selection policy for determining a NL(s) for the service request, it will be appreciated that where network layer selection information is not maintained as network layer selection policies, selection of a NL(s) for the service request may be performed by, more generally, processing the network layer selection information for selecting the NL(s) for the service request based on the characteristic(s) of the service request.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The NLSS <b>140</b>, upon selection of a NL(s) for a service request, initiates signaling for enabling establishment of one or more service sessions using the selected NL(s).</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The selection of a single NL for a service session may result in establishment (or at least partial establishment) of a session within LWN <b>110</b> using the selected NL of LWN <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The selection of multiple NLs for a service session may result in establishment of one or more sessions within LWN <b>110</b> using the selected NLs of LWN <b>110</b>. For example, multiple NLs may be specified in priority order where only a single session is established via one of the NLs at any given time (e.g. a session is initially established via a highest priority NL and, if the session via the highest priority NL is lost or degraded, the session is then migrated to the next highest priority NL, and so forth, so that support for the service session within LWN <b>110</b> can adapt dynamically to conditions associated with WUD <b>120</b>, conditions within LWN <b>110</b>, and the like, as well as combinations thereof). For example, multiple NLs may be specified in priority order where only a single session is fully established via LWN <b>110</b> at any given time, but one or more protection sessions is partially established such that the time required to switch from the active session to a protection session is reduced (e.g., WUD <b>120</b> participates in a full session to a first WAN <b>112</b> and registers with an access terminal of a second WAN <b>112</b> so that the session can be switched to the second WAN <b>112</b> when needed or desired). For example, the requested service may require multiple sessions to be active at the same time, in which case the different sessions may be established over different NLs. It will be appreciated that these are just a few examples, and that many other combinations of active and/or partial sessions may be established and utilized to support a service session.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The NLSS <b>140</b> initiates signaling for enabling establishment of the service session(s) for the WUD <b>120</b>.

A more detailed description of such signaling follows.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In one embodiment, NLSS <b>140</b> signals an indication of the selected NL(s) to WUD <b>120</b> for use by WUD <b>120</b> in establishing one or more service sessions on the selected NL(s). In one such embodiment, establishment of the session(s) by WUD <b>120</b> may control establishment of the session(s) in LWN <b>110</b>. In another such embodiment, establishment of the session(s) by WUD <b>120</b> will not necessarily control establishment of the sessions in LWN <b>110</b> and, thus, NLSS <b>140</b> may perform additional signaling to LWN <b>110</b> for purposes of enabling the one or more service sessions to be established within LWN <b>110</b>. The NLSS <b>140</b> may signal the indication of the selected NL(s) to WUD <b>120</b> in any suitable manner (e.g., via a portion of LWN <b>110</b>, via a signaling path outside of LWN <b>110</b>, and the like, as well as combinations thereof). In one embodiment, NLSS <b>140</b> signals NLSA <b>124</b> of WUD <b>120</b> for providing the indication of the selected NL(s) from NLSS <b>140</b> to WUD <b>120</b> (e.g., such as where signaling is performed from a network layer selection agent on NLSS <b>140</b> to the NLSA <b>124</b> of WUD <b>120</b>). The indication of the selected NL(s) may be signaled from NLSS <b>140</b> to UD <b>120</b> in any other suitable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In one embodiment, NLSS <b>140</b> initiates signaling to LWN <b>110</b> for causing LWN <b>110</b> to establish one or more sessions on the selected NL(s). The NLSS <b>140</b> may provide any information suitable for use by LWN <b>110</b> in establishing one or more sessions on the selected NL(s), such as (1) an indication that one or more sessions should be established on the NL(s) (from which components of networks <b>112</b> may determine and apply configuration information for establishing the session(s)), (2) information adapted for use by components of networks <b>112</b> for determining and applying configuration information for establishing the session(s), (3) configuration information to be applied on components within networks <b>112</b> for establishing the session(s), and the like, as well as combinations thereof. The NLSS <b>140</b> may initiate signaling to any suitable components of LWN <b>110</b> and/or associated with LWN <b>110</b>, e.g., the network elements of the networks <b>112</b> to be configured, controllers of the networks <b>112</b> to be configured, the network APIs/agents <b>113</b> of the networks <b>112</b> to be configured, management systems associated with the networks <b>122</b> to be configured, and the like, as well as combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In one embodiment, NLSS <b>140</b> (and/or WUD <b>120</b>) signals an indication of the selected NL(s) to the associated AS <b>130</b> for use by the AS <b>130</b>. The AS <b>130</b> may use the indication of the selected NL(s) in any suitable manner. For example, the AS <b>130</b> may use the indication of the selected NL(s) to support establishment of the service session(s), such as by reserving application resources, initiating an application-layer session, obtaining addresses, and the like. For example, the AS <b>130</b> may use the indication of the selected NL(s) to adapt content to the capabilities of the selected NL(s). The NLSS <b>140</b> (and/or WUD <b>120</b>) may signal the indication of the selected NL(s) to WUD <b>120</b> in any suitable manner (e.g., via a portion of LWN <b>110</b>, via a signaling path outside of LWN <b>110</b>, and the like, as well as combinations thereof).</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The NLSS <b>140</b> may initiate signaling for enabling reconfiguration of the service session(s) for WUD <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The reconfiguration of the service session(s) for WUD <b>120</b> may include any suitable types of reconfigurations, such as one or more of moving a service session between NLs, establishing a new service session that is associated with the existing service session, establishing a new service session that replaces the existing service session, and the like, as well as combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The reconfiguration of the service session(s) may be initiated in response to one or more trigger conditions (e.g., such as changes in network layer selection information, trigger conditions detected by monitoring service sessions, and the like, as well as combinations thereof).</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The reconfiguration of the service session(s) may be initiated in response to changes in network layer selection information. The changes in network layer selection information may be detected in any suitable manner (e.g., such as where NLSS <b>140</b> monitors for changes in one or more of service provider preference information, network state information, and the like, as well as combinations thereof). For example, network state information indicating that there is congestion in the LTE WAN <b>112</b><sub>W1 </sub>may cause reconfiguration of a service session traversing LTE WAN <b>112</b><sub>W1 </sub>such that the service session moves from traversing LTE WAN <b>112</b><sub>W1 </sub>to traversing 3GPP2 Core WAN <b>112</b><sub>W2</sub>. For example, network selection state information received from an AS <b>130</b> associated with a service session using WiFi WAN <b>112</b><sub>W3 </sub>may indicate that the type of content being transported via the service session is better suited for transmission over LTE WAN <b>112</b><sub>W1</sub>, thereby causing reconfiguration of the service session such that the service session moves from traversing WiFi WAN <b>112</b><sub>W3 </sub>to traversing LTE WAN <b>112</b><sub>W1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The reconfiguration of the service session(s) may be initiated in response to trigger conditions detected by monitoring service sessions (e.g., detecting initiation of requests in conjunction with the service session(s), detecting conditions identified by monitoring content conveyed by the service session(s), and the like, as well as combinations thereof).</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">For example, participants in a conference call, where the user of the WUD <b>120</b> is communicating via a NL that includes CDMA/EVDO WAN <b>112</b><sub>W2 </sub>and 3GPP2 Core WAN <b>112</b><sub>C2</sub>, may decide to move to a video conference and, thus, may initiate a request for a video conference. In this example, NLSS <b>140</b> may detect the request to move to a video conference and, thus, may initiate signaling for causing the service session for WUD <b>120</b> to be moved from the NL that includes CDMA/EVDO WAN <b>112</b><sub>W2 </sub>and 3GPP2 Core WAN <b>112</b><sub>C2 </sub>to a NL that includes LTE WAN <b>112</b><sub>W1 </sub>and EPC WAN <b>112</b><sub>C1</sub>, which is better suited for transport of streaming video required for the video conference.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">For example, NLSS <b>140</b> may monitor heartbeat information transported via a service session established between WUD <b>120</b> (which is configured for monitoring the heart of the user of WUD <b>120</b>) and one of the ASs <b>130</b> (which is configured for receiving and storing the heartbeat information of the user such that it is available for analysis by a doctor). For example, the heartbeat monitoring session may be supporting using a NL that includes Zigbee WAN <b>112</b><sub>W4 </sub>and Wired CN <b>112</b><sub>C3</sub>. In this example, in response to detecting an irregular heartbeat of the user based on the monitoring of the heartbeat information, NLSS <b>140</b> initiates establishment of a telephone call between the user and his doctor. The NLSS <b>140</b> selects one of the NLs for the telephone call (e.g., such as CDMA/EVDO WAN <b>112</b><sub>W2 </sub>and EPC CN <b>112</b><sub>C1</sub>) and initiates signaling for establishing the service session via the NL that is selected for the telephone call. In this example, the original heartbeat monitoring session may continue to be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The trigger conditions may include any other trigger conditions which may cause reconfiguration of a service session.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The NLSS <b>140</b> may perform monitoring for the service session(s) for determining whether or not reconfiguration of the service sessions(s) should or must be initiated. The monitoring may be performed in any manner suitable for enabling NLSS <b>140</b> to detect conditions which cause reconfiguration of service sessions.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In one embodiment, reconfiguration of a service session includes moving service sessions between NLs. In one embodiment, in which a service session is moved from a first NL to a second NL, NLSS <b>140</b> initiates signaling to one or both of the first NL and the second NL, informing the NL(s) that the service session should be moved, and the first NL and second NL may then communicate directly for purposes of moving the service session. In one such embodiment, communication between NLs, for purposes of controlling the movement of a service session between the NLs, is exchanged by the network agents/APIs <b>113</b> of the networks <b>112</b> of the involved NLs. The movement of a service session between NLs also may include signaling within each of the respective NLs (e.g., between networks APIs/agents <b>113</b> of networks <b>112</b> and/or networks elements of networks <b>112</b> of the first NL for purposes of terminating the session within the first NL and between networks APIs/agents <b>113</b> of networks <b>112</b> and/or networks elements of networks <b>112</b> of the second NL for purposes of establishing the session within the second NL).</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In one embodiment, reconfiguration of a service session includes establishing a new service session that is associated with the existing service session.

<p id="p-0180" num="0179">For example, where a first network layer is being used for M2M traffic of a health monitoring device, upon detection by the health monitoring device of an anomaly associated with the health of the user of the health monitoring device, the health monitoring device may send a signal requesting initiation of a video conference call (e.g., such that the user may discuss the potential health problem with his or her doctor). The health monitoring device may initiate the request for the video conference call in any suitable manner. For example, the health monitoring device may initiate a request for an IP address for the video conference call. In this example, the request by the health monitoring device is detected by the NLSS, which then selects a network layer suitable for supporting for the video conference call (e.g., a second network layer that is better suited than the first network for streaming video) and initiates signaling for establishing the video conference call via the selected network layer.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">For example, where a first network layer is being used for voice traffic of participants in a conference call, upon detection, by the telephone of one of the participants, of a request by the participant to move to a video conference, the telephone sends a signal requesting initiation of a video conference. The telephone may initiate the request for the video conference in any suitable manner. For example, the telephone may initiate a request for an IP address for the video conference call. In this example, the request by the telephone is detected by the NLSS, which then selects a network layer suitable for supporting for the video conference (e.g., a second network layer that is better suited than the first network for streaming video) and initiates signaling for establishing the video conference call via the selected network layer.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">It will be appreciated that many other types of user devices may detect many other types of trigger conditions which cause initiation of associated trigger signals which are then detected by the NLSS and which cause the NLSS to initiate signaling for establishing new service sessions, reconfiguring existing service sessions, and the like, as well as combinations thereof.</p>

<p id="p-0184" num="0183">The layered wireless network capability may be better understood by way of an example.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6D</figref> depict an exemplary use of the layered wireless network of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to maintain wireless connectivity for an e-mail application. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A-6D</figref>, exemplary communication system <b>600</b> is essentially the same as exemplary communication system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, with some differences that are described below. In this example, WUD <b>120</b> includes an email client <b>602</b> and the ASs <b>130</b> include an email server <b>604</b> (the ASs <b>130</b> are omitted for purposes of clarity). In this example, WUD <b>120</b> includes a wired NIM <b>622</b> connected to wired CN <b>112</b><sub>C3</sub>. In this example, email client <b>602</b> is adapted for receiving and sending emails. In this example, email server <b>604</b> includes a layering control API/agent that can work in a high-rate mode or a low-rate mode. In this example, upon receiving a service request from WUD <b>120</b> for an email service supported by email client <b>602</b> and email server <b>604</b>, NLSS <b>140</b> identifies the network layer selection policy for email applications based on the application type associated with the request for the email service. In this example, assume that the network layer selection policy specifies use the following network access technologies in the following order (from highest priority to lowest priority): wired, WiFi, 3G, and 4G. In other words, in this example the network layer selection policy for email applications specifies use of a wired access network as one of the network access technologies, in addition to multiple wireless access technologies. It will be appreciated that the network layer selection policy may specify use of the 3G-based network layer before use of the 4G-based network layer, despite the higher rates available via the 4G-based network layer, so as to attempt to keep the 4G resource available for carrying types of traffic better suited for transport over a 4G network (e.g., video traffic and the like).</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, in response to a request by the WUD <b>120</b> for the email service, an active service session <b>605</b><sub>A </sub>is established between email client <b>602</b> on WUD <b>120</b> and email server <b>604</b> (via wired NIM <b>622</b> and wired CN <b>112</b><sub>C3</sub>) and a standby service session <b>606</b><sub>A </sub>is partially established from email client <b>602</b> on WUD <b>120</b> to WiFi WAN <b>112</b><sub>W3 </sub>(for use if needed). The WUD <b>120</b> obtains two local IP addresses, Le., one for wired NIM <b>622</b> and wired CN <b>112</b><sub>C3 </sub>(for use) and one for WiFi NIM <b>122</b><sub>3 </sub>and WiFi WAN <b>112</b><sub>W3 </sub>(for standby, if needed). The layering control API/agent of email server <b>604</b> is set to work in a high-rate mode for sending emails to the email client <b>602</b> of WUD <b>120</b> (based on the connection of WUD <b>120</b> via a wired connection).</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, in response to disconnection of the WUD <b>120</b> from using a wired connection, the service session for the email service is switched from using the active service session <b>605</b><sub>A </sub>via the wired connection to using the standby service session <b>606</b><sub>A </sub>via the WiFi-based network layer. In this case, establishment of the standby service session <b>606</b><sub>A </sub>via WiFi is completed such that the WiFi connection becomes the active service session <b>605</b><sub>B </sub>for the email service. The WUD <b>120</b> swaps from wired NIM <b>622</b> to WiFi NIM <b>122</b><sub>3</sub>. The WUD <b>120</b> swaps from the active local IP address obtained for wired CN <b>112</b><sub>C3 </sub>to the standby local IP address obtained for WiFi WAN <b>112</b><sub>W3</sub>. The wired CN <b>112</b><sub>C3 </sub>handles the swap using a Network Address Translation (NAT) function (e.g., of a domestic RGW). The layering control API/agent of email server <b>604</b> continues to work in the high-rate mode for sending emails to the email client <b>602</b> of WUD <b>120</b>. The WiFi-based network layer is used, even where 3G-based and/or 4G-based network layers are available, because the network layer selection policy specifies use of WiFi before 3G or 4G. In addition, assuming that 3G access is available to WUD <b>120</b>, a standby service session <b>606</b><sub>B </sub>is established between email client <b>602</b> on WUD <b>120</b> and email server <b>604</b> the 3G-based network layer (e.g., a new mobile domain IP address association is opened and the email client <b>602</b> of WUD <b>120</b> is authenticated with email server <b>604</b>, via the 3G-based network layer that traverses CDMA/EVDO NIM <b>122</b><sub>2</sub>, CDMA/EVDO WAN <b>112</b><sub>W2</sub>, and EPC CN <b>112</b><sub>C1</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, in response to loss of the WiFi connection by WUD <b>120</b> (e.g., the user has left his or her house and is driving to work), the service session for the email service is switched from using the active service session <b>605</b><sub>B </sub>via the WiFi-based network layer to using the standby service session <b>606</b><sub>B </sub>via the 3G-based network layer. In this case, the active service session <b>605</b><sub>C </sub>for the email service uses CDMA/EVDO WAN <b>112</b><sub>W2 </sub>and EPC CN <b>112</b><sub>C1</sub>. The WUD <b>120</b> swaps from WiFi NIM <b>122</b><sub>3 </sub>to CDMA/EVDO NIM <b>122</b><sub>2</sub>. The WUD <b>120</b> continues to use the local IP address. The email client <b>602</b> on WUD <b>120</b> reports a change (decrease) in capacity to email server <b>604</b> and, in response, the layering control API/agent of email server <b>604</b> switches from high-rate mode to low-rate mode for sending emails to the email client <b>602</b> of WUD <b>120</b>. The 3G-based network layer is used, even where the 4G-based network layer is available, because the network layer selection policy specifies use of 3G before 4G.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>, in response to loss of 3G coverage by WUD <b>120</b>, the service session for the email service is switched from using the active service session <b>605</b><sub>C </sub>via the 3G-based network layer to using the active service session <b>605</b><sub>D </sub>via the 4G-based network layer. In this case, the active service session <b>605</b><sub>D </sub>for the email service uses LTE WAN <b>112</b><sub>W1 </sub>and continues to use EPC CN <b>112</b><sub>C1</sub>. The WUD <b>120</b> swaps from CDMA/EVDO NIM <b>122</b><sub>2 </sub>to LTE NIM <b>122</b><sub>1</sub>. The WUD <b>120</b> continues to use the local IP address. The email client <b>602</b> on WUD <b>120</b> reports a change (increase) in capacity to email server <b>604</b> and, in response, the layering control API/agent of email server <b>604</b> switches from low-rate mode to high-rate mode for sending emails to the email client <b>602</b> of WUD <b>120</b>. The 3G-based network layer is used, even where the 4G-based network layer is available, because the network layer selection policy specifies use of 3G before 4G.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Although omitted for purposes of clarity, it will be appreciated that the email service session also may transition back to previously used network layers as the network layers become available (e.g., from using the 4G-based network layer to using the 3G-based network layer when WUD <b>120</b> regains 3G coverage, from using the 3G-based network layer to using the WiFi-based network layer when WUD <b>120</b> regains WiFi coverage, from using the 4G-based network layer to using the WiFi-based network layer when the WUD <b>120</b> regains WiFi coverage, and the like).</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">The layered wireless network capability enables selection between multiple network layers and, thus, multiple network technologies, including both radio access technologies and core technologies, thereby enabling traffic to be transported using technologies best suited for the traffic based on intelligent network layer selection policies, while also taking into account such information as provider preferences, network cost, network congestion, network availability, and the like, as well as combinations thereof. In this manner, the layered wireless network capability enables seamless use of the most optimum network for traffic depending on service provider preferences, network cost, network congestion, network availability, and the like, as well as combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">The layered wireless network capability provides many functions, as depicted and described herein. The layered wireless network capability allows invoked applications and network considerations to alter WUD-oriented selection of wireless access, e.g., by informing the WUD of the network layer(s) that it should or must access for particular applications and/or by forcing the WUD to access one or more network layer(s) for particular applications. The layered wireless network capability provides WUD and/or network support for simultaneous bearers on multiple wireless access technologies on a per-application and/or cross-application basis (e.g., where the capability is embedded in the WUD and/or implemented in APIs/agents of the layered wireless network capability). The layered wireless network capability enables applications to become NL-aware, such that content of the applications can be adapted to capabilities of the NL(s) used to transport the content (e.g., embedded within the applications and/or provided within the network using bearer control APIs/agents).</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">The layered wireless network capability provides costs savings for wireless service providers while at the same time improving the quality of service and quality of experience provided to end users. These benefits are achieved at least one or more of the following: enabling network layer selection (and, thus, access technology selection) based on application needs and transport costs, enabling traffic segmentation into network layers and load balancing between network layers (and, thus, between networks), economically supporting new applications by better managing capacity across network layers (and, thus, across networks), providing content adaptation based on access technology, and the like, as well as combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">The layered wireless network capability enables new business models which will bring in new sets of customers to the service provider. For example, the layered wireless network capability supports assigning of an application to a network layer(s) in accordance with the associated value of the application. For example, the layered wireless network capability supports providing highly reliable connections for critical applications (e.g., home security applications, health monitoring applications, and the like) using multiple sessions established over different network layers and, thus, different networks.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The layered wireless network capability provides many other advantages over existing network access schemes.</p>
