<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to blowers used in vehicle wash systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Blowers are used in the drying section of vehicle wash systems. In both conveyor/tunnel-type wash systems and &#x201c;roll-over&#x201d; type vehicle wash systems, the drying section is typically located just before the vehicle exits the wash system. The drying section of a wash system may be comprised of a plurality of air blowers mounted on a frame. The air blowers are employed to dry the vehicles by forcing a stream of air over the surface of the vehicle. The stream of air may also be heated above ambient temperature. Such blowers are commonly referred to as &#x201c;dryers&#x201d; in vehicle wash systems.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Each dryer typically has an outer housing or plenum enclosing a cavity that contains an impeller. The impeller may be connected to, and rotated by, the drive shaft of a motor. The motor may be an electric motor. The motor causes the impeller to draw in the gas (e.g. air) into the plenum, compress it, and then expel the compressed gas through an exit port, from the plenum. The exit port may have a nozzle associated therewith, to assist in directing the flow of air. The result is that a blower employed in a vehicle wash system can direct a high speed and volume of airflow over a vehicle surface to rapidly dry the vehicle before it exits the wash system.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The operation of blowers in vehicle wash systems may be controlled by a controller. For example, to conserve power, a relatively simple controller can be provided that is operable to switch the supply of power to the motor on and off, depending upon whether or not a vehicle is in the drying section of the vehicle wash system. The presence of a vehicle in the drying section can be detected by a known type of sensor. However, such blower control systems do not significantly address the intermittent nature of vehicle traffic in a wash system. It is not desirable to simply start and stop the blower motors as each vehicle passes into and out of the drying section.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It should be noted that starting and stopping an electric motor to achieve intermittent blower operation is disadvantageous. For example, when an electric motor is started, it generates a high transient peak load and often a large amount of heat. The high peak load may be undesirable as wash system operators may be charged more by their electrical utilities if there are peaks in their electricity demand, resulting in higher operational costs. The high peak load generated when starting an electric motor is compounded in a wash system since the drying section may have a plurality of blowers, many of which may be started at approximately the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Also, frequently starting and stopping a blower motor decreases the life span of the motor, resulting in overall higher operating costs. Additionally, the large amount of heat generated upon starting and stopping an electric motor limits the rate at which the motor may be started and stopped. The amount of heat generated may be so significant that the blower cannot feasibly be started and stopped for each vehicle. Furthermore, starting and stopping the blower motor is relatively slow and may limit the capacity of the drying section.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, operating the motors continuously under load results in unnecessary wear and tear on the blowers and is not energy efficient, both factors resulting in increased operating costs. A further disadvantage of continuously operating the blowers is that the blowers when being operated under load create a high noise level, particularly when no vehicle is present in the drying section to dampen the sound.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Previous attempts have been made to try to overcome some of these problems, but these methods are deficient in other ways. For example, a variable speed motor (variable frequency drive motor) could be employed, but there are significant additional costs associated with such motors. Additionally, variable speed motors may result in higher levels of electrical noise, compared to constant speed motors.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is also known to operate the blower motor continuously, but having an outlet valve device, whereby the exit port is only opened when a vehicle is in position to be dried. This approach allows the fan to be operated under a reduced load when the exit port is closed, reducing electricity usage and noise. However, restricting or blocking the exit port creates an undesirable back-pressure that may reduce the life span of the blower components. Furthermore, to limit the flow through the exit port, the components must be capable of providing sufficient force to overcome the high velocity airflow to secure the closure of the exit. Consequently, placing the control mechanism at the exit port results in increased cost and places the control system and other blower components under increased stress.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is also known to control the flow of air through a blower in a vehicle wash system by controlling the flow at the inlet using one or more damper devices. However, there are significant disadvantages to the known inlet control devices, particularly in the manner in which the flow of air into an air blower is regulated. Sustainable operation of known blower systems in wash systems at less than full capacity has proved difficult in the past. For example, it is known to employ a valve plate as a valve mechanism to control the amount of air entering the blower; however this results in an unbalanced load being distributed over the impeller when the intake damper is not in the fully open or fully closed positions. Similarly, it is known to employ louvers to block the air flow at the inlet, but this may disturb the uniformity of the air entering the blower when rotated to a partially open position and provide non-uniform input air flow on the impeller. The louvers may also be required to be positioned a minimum distance from the impeller for optimal performance, particularly if rotated to a partially open position, rendering it difficult to design a compact blower system.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additionally, known systems for drying vehicles do not accommodate variations in the types of vehicle being dried or distinguish between different part of the same vehicle, by varying the amount of air flow directed to the vehicle or specific parts thereof.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As referenced above, wash systems typically include a drying section to remove water from the vehicle surface, employing high velocity and high volume air, before the vehicle exits from the wash system. Illustrative examples disclosed hereinafter make reference to drying sections included in conveyor type wash systems, although the blower systems may also be applicable to rollover or other types of wash systems, with any required suitable modification.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary layout of a conveyor type wash system <b>10</b>, the basic components of which are known in the art. Vehicles (not shown) may enter the wash system <b>10</b> at position <b>14</b> and may engage a conveyor system <b>12</b>. The conveyor system <b>12</b> may provide for the movement of each vehicle as it proceeds through system <b>10</b> and ultimately exits at position <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Upon entry to wash system <b>10</b>, a vehicle may pass through a wash section <b>18</b>, which may be comprised of a series of brushes, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Alternatively, wash section <b>18</b>, may be a touch-less type wash section, that may have a plurality of high-pressure spray nozzles which can direct washing fluid onto the outer surface of the vehicle. Other embodiments for wash section <b>18</b> are also contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Following wash section <b>18</b>, a rinse section <b>20</b> may cleanse the vehicle of any dirt, detergent or other treatments that have been applied in the wash section.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Drying section <b>22</b> may be located after wash section <b>18</b> and rinse section <b>20</b>. Drying section <b>22</b> may include a plurality of blowers <b>30</b> affixed to a support frame <b>24</b>. Each blower <b>30</b> may be supported in different ways, such as a support frame <b>24</b>, in a manner that suits the particular application and configuration that is desired. One suitable method of attaching a blower <b>30</b> to a support frame <b>24</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, where a blower <b>30</b> may be attached to a motor <b>31</b>, the motor <b>31</b> being itself attached to the support frame <b>24</b> via an attachment bracket <b>60</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the motor <b>31</b> may be secured to the plenum <b>44</b> using, for example, a plurality of bolts and washers <b>70</b>. Similarly, an attachment bracket <b>60</b> may be secured to a motor <b>31</b> using a plurality of bolts and washers <b>71</b>. The particular details of the attachment bracket <b>60</b> may be varied in a number of ways, but it may be advantageous to use an attachment bracket <b>60</b> that permits some adjustment of a blower <b>30</b> relative to a support frame <b>24</b>. An exemplary adjustable mounting bracket is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,530,115, the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The blowers may be configured in a variety of different ways to direct a stream of moving air onto the surface of a vehicle located in drying section <b>22</b>. Frame <b>24</b> may be comprised of a material suitable to support the weight and withstand the load imparted by the blowers <b>30</b> when in operation, such as, for example, steel, aluminum or an aluminum alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, four blowers <b>30</b> are shown in an exemplary configuration. Numerous other configurations may be employed such as, for example, the drying section <b>26</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which has six blowers <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Each blower <b>30</b> may be driven by a motor <b>31</b> operatively coupled to an impeller to provide a forced airflow that can be used to dry vehicles in the wash system <b>10</b>. An example of a suitable motor <b>31</b> that can be employed is the model CM3711T motor made by Baldor Electric Company. Example interconnection methods to couple an electric motor to an impeller are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The motor <b>31</b> may be an electric motor or other suitable type of motor and will typically be a constant speed motor. However, blowers as described herein could be driven by a variable speed motor having its speed controlled by a control device.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The operation of the various components of car wash system <b>10</b> may be controlled by a central system controller <b>19</b>. For example, controller <b>19</b> may be a model CCS5000 control system made by MacNeil Wash Systems. Electronic eyes or sensors in communication with the control system <b>19</b> may be used to detect the presence of a vehicle and the vehicle type in a manner known to those skilled in the art, and/or as is described below in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 12</figref>, an individual blower <b>30</b> may have a plenum or outer housing <b>44</b>, with an impeller <b>62</b> located and mounted for rotation inside an internal cavity <b>43</b>. As clearly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an inlet cone <b>64</b> may also be mounted inside an internal cavity <b>43</b> and function to channel air entering the plenum <b>44</b> into the hollow center region of the impeller <b>62</b>. A screen plate <b>66</b> may also be employed for safety reasons to minimize the likelihood of objects entering the plenum <b>44</b>. Screen plate <b>66</b> may be secured by a plurality of bolts <b>72</b> with washers, the bolts passing through aligned holes in an inlet ring <b>68</b>, an inlet cone <b>64</b>, and the surface of a plenum <b>44</b>. Additionally, a discharge screen <b>74</b> may be mounted inside an internal cavity <b>43</b> of a plenum <b>44</b> surrounding the periphery of the impeller <b>62</b> also for safety reasons. The discharge screen <b>74</b> may have diamond shaped holes which may operate to reduce the turbulence and noise associated with the discharge screen <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Cavity <b>43</b> may have a cavity inlet opening <b>47</b> and an exit port generally designated <b>48</b>. Cavity inlet opening <b>47</b> may be located in a side face <b>44</b><i>a </i>of plenum <b>44</b>. Exit port <b>48</b> may be provided in plenum <b>44</b> and permits air that is drawn through inlet opening <b>47</b>, to be compressed by the rotating impeller <b>62</b>, and then to flow from the plenum <b>44</b> through the exit port <b>48</b> out of the blower <b>30</b>. Affixed to, or formed as part of, exit port <b>48</b> may be a nozzle <b>51</b> that may be configured to focus the airflow in a specific direction and emit the air at a further enhanced flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Nozzle <b>51</b> may be capable of being rotated or otherwise having its position or orientation adjusted, through manual adjustment or by way of the operation of an electronic controller (not shown). For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,530,115 describes a method and apparatus of providing an appropriately directed air stream from a blower in response to certain control information, including vehicle position and width data. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a nozzle adjustment mechanism <b>80</b> may be attached to a plenum <b>44</b> via attachment bracket <b>56</b> in order to permit the nozzle <b>51</b> to be rotated in response to control signals provided by a controller (not shown). Other types of mechanisms/systems may be employed to provide an electronically adjustable nozzle <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As mentioned above, the impeller <b>62</b> located inside the plenum <b>44</b> may be rotated by the drive shaft <b>39</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of a motor <b>31</b>. When the impeller rotates, air may be drawn through cavity opening <b>47</b> into cavity <b>43</b> where it is compressed, and then exit from plenum <b>44</b> through the exit port <b>48</b> and nozzle <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">An inlet region <b>49</b> is provided proximate and is in communication with cavity opening <b>47</b>. An inlet opening <b>45</b> can be provided to inlet region <b>49</b> to provide communication with ambient air. Inlet opening <b>45</b> may be formed at the edge surface of a cylinder (of any cross sectional shape, including a circular cylinder) defined between an outward facing surface <b>44</b><i>a </i>of the plenum <b>44</b> (such as at the peripheral edge <b>47</b><i>a </i>of circular opening <b>47</b> to cavity <b>43</b>), and the inward facing surface <b>42</b><i>a </i>of a valve sleeve member <b>42</b>. Air must pass through inlet opening <b>45</b> before it can be drawn into an inlet region <b>49</b> and then pass through opening <b>47</b> into cavity <b>43</b> of plenum <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Plenum <b>44</b>, impeller <b>62</b> and baffle plate can be manufactured from suitable materials such as plastic, aluminum, or steel.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Baffle plate <b>46</b> may be mounted to plenum <b>44</b> in fixed spaced relation to opening <b>47</b> by a plurality of transversely extending rigid rod members <b>54</b>. One end of each rod <b>54</b> can be affixed to an outer surface of plenum <b>44</b> and the other end of each rod <b>54</b> is affixed to the baffle plate <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Blower <b>30</b> may also include valve sleeve member <b>42</b> that may be configured as a generally cylindrical housing with an inner surface <b>42</b><i>a</i>. Sleeve member <b>42</b> can also be manufactured from any suitable material such as plastic, or steel. Sleeve member <b>42</b> may be mounted for reciprocating axial movement towards and away from plenum <b>44</b> and in particular cavity side opening <b>47</b>. In this way the size of inlet opening <b>45</b> may be varied.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The movement of sleeve member <b>42</b> may be effected by a hydraulic or pneumatic cylinder <b>52</b> that is mounted to baffle plate <b>46</b> as further described below. Inner surface <b>42</b><i>a </i>of sleeve <b>42</b> may engage and slide over the outer peripheral edge <b>46</b><i>a </i>of baffle plate <b>46</b> such that sleeve <b>42</b> may to some extent be supported on baffle plate <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The interconnection between inner surface <b>42</b><i>a </i>of sleeve <b>42</b>, and peripheral edge <b>46</b><i>a </i>of baffle plate <b>46</b> can be such that a significant amount of air can not pass between surface <b>42</b><i>a </i>of sleeve <b>42</b> and the peripheral edge <b>46</b><i>a </i>of baffle plate <b>46</b>. When mounted on, and in connection with, intake baffle plate <b>46</b>, depending upon its axial position, sleeve <b>42</b> can reduce the size of the available open area of inlet opening <b>45</b> thus controlling the amount of air passing into inlet region <b>49</b>. Furthermore sleeve <b>42</b> may substantially prevent air from entering inlet region <b>49</b> through inlet opening <b>45</b> when the sleeve <b>42</b> is in the closed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, such that the inlet opening <b>45</b> is substantially blocked.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The amount of air allowed to enter the inlet opening <b>45</b> when sleeve <b>42</b> is in the closed position may be varied to suit particular applications. For example, by varying the degree to which a seal between inner sleeve surface <b>42</b><i>a </i>of sleeve <b>42</b> and outward facing surface <b>44</b><i>a </i>of the plenum <b>44</b> is provided when sleeve <b>42</b> is in the closed position, the amount of air entering the blower <b>30</b> and consequently the amount of air exiting the blower <b>30</b> can be varied. In some embodiments, the normal manufacturing tolerances that exist in manufacturing the sleeve and plenum may provide sufficient gap to allow a suitable but substantially reduced amount of amount of airflow to continue to be emitted by the air blower when sleeve <b>42</b> is in the &#x201c;closed&#x201d; position. In other embodiments, a gap can be specifically provided when sleeve <b>42</b> is in the &#x201c;closed&#x201d; position to provide a reduced amount of air flow.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">It should be noted that while sleeve inner surface <b>42</b><i>a </i>and baffle plate peripheral edge <b>46</b><i>a </i>have generally circular forms in the illustrated embodiment, other shapes can also be provided. For example, both could be formed with edges defining a square, rectangle or other polygonal shape. Also, in other embodiments, a combined closure device may be formed which does not have a separate baffle plate. In such embodiments, the entire closure device may move axially towards and away from the peripheral edge <b>47</b><i>a </i>of opening <b>47</b> into cavity <b>43</b>. The inlet opening <b>45</b> may thus be defined by (a) an opening between the side face of the plenum, or the surface of another portion of, or member associated with, the plenum; and (b) the inner surface edge of the closure device. Thus, an inlet region like region <b>49</b> can be formed having an opening <b>45</b> the size of which can be varied by a closure device.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Likewise, the cavity opening <b>47</b> into plenum <b>44</b> does not have to be circular, but can be of another shape that is either the same as, or different from, the shape of sleeve inner surface <b>42</b><i>a </i>and outer peripheral edge <b>46</b><i>a </i>of the baffle plate <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A hydraulic or pneumatic system may be used to axially move the valve sleeve <b>42</b> relative to baffle plate <b>46</b> and cavity opening <b>47</b>. Hydraulic or pneumatic cylinder <b>52</b> may be mounted to, and solely supported by, baffle plate <b>46</b>. The cylinder section <b>53</b> of cylinder <b>52</b> may be positioned at a rear surface <b>46</b><i>c </i>of baffle plate <b>46</b> and have a piston rod <b>58</b> that may extend through a centrally positioned and axially aligned aperture passing through the baffle plate <b>46</b>. A threaded extension from cylinder section <b>53</b> may also extend through the aperture in baffle plate <b>46</b> and engage a threaded nut <b>55</b>. Thus when nut <b>55</b> is tightened, cylinder section <b>43</b> may be drawn into tight engagement with rear surface <b>46</b><i>c </i>of baffle plate <b>46</b>, thus securely mounting the cylinder <b>52</b> to baffle plate <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Piston rod <b>58</b> may be free to have reciprocal movement through the aperture in baffle plate <b>46</b>. The distal end <b>58</b><i>a </i>of piston <b>58</b> can be attached to a central hub <b>63</b> of a frame member <b>61</b>. Frame member may have a plurality of legs <b>59</b> extending from hub <b>63</b> with the distal ends of the legs secured to the outward facing surface annular surface <b>42</b><i>b </i>of valve sleeve <b>42</b>. Other means of attachment of the cylinder <b>52</b> to the baffle plate <b>46</b> or valve sleeve <b>42</b> may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Cylinder <b>52</b> may be conveniently positioned in axial alignment with the central axis of rotation of the impeller and may be a reciprocating double acting piston. The movement of rod <b>58</b> may be controlled by controlling the flow of fluid or compressed air to the double chambers of cylinder <b>52</b>. This may be effected by employing electronic valves that may be activated and controlled by a suitable PLC device. An example of a suitable cylinder that might be employed is the model D-97475-A2 made by Bimba Manufacturing. The PLC used to control the operation of cylinder <b>52</b> and the associated valves, can be part of the overall system controller <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When in the closed position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, impeller <b>62</b> may be efficiently operated as it is under a minimal load because the valve sleeve <b>42</b> substantially prevents air from entering the plenum <b>44</b> and placing a load on the impeller. Controlling the air intake necessarily results in control of the air exiting the plenum <b>44</b> via the exit port <b>48</b>, providing the ability to control the airflow without starting and stopping the blower motor. Advantageously, controlling the air at the plenum <b>44</b> inlet may reduce or avoid potential problems created by back-pressure and may reduce stresses imparted on the impeller and other blower components. Furthermore, when blower <b>30</b> is operated with sleeve <b>42</b> in the closed position, the noise is substantially reduced due to the substantial reduction of air exiting blower <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> illustrate the blower plenum <b>30</b> in the open or operable position, exposing the inlet region <b>49</b>. The valve sleeve <b>42</b> may be axially spaced at a distance d from the plenum <b>44</b> in the operable position. In the operable position, air is permitted to enter the plenum <b>44</b> via the air inlet <b>45</b> and exit the plenum <b>44</b> via the exit port <b>48</b>. Moreover, translating the sleeve <b>42</b> in the axial direction, while the blower motor is continuously operating; allows the blower <b>30</b> airflow to be rapidly turned on and off. The relative area of inlet <b>45</b> when the sleeve is fully open to the area of cavity inlet <b>47</b> may be relatively high. For example, a circular cavity inlet <b>47</b> may have a diameter D of in the range of approximately 10&#x2033;-11&#x2033; inches and the maximum distance d when the sleeve is in the operable position may be in the range of approximately 2&#x2033; to 3&#x2033; inches. A ratio of D/d may be in the range of about 3.3:1 to 5.5:1. Thus, by providing a large enough inlet opening <b>45</b>, air may not be restricted at the air inlet opening when flowing into cavity opening <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The blower <b>30</b> may exhibit a predictable relationship between the axial movement of sleeve <b>42</b> and the area exposed of inlet <b>45</b>. Thus if the distance d is doubled, the area of inlet <b>45</b> that is exposed may also approximately double. This permits the airflow entering plenum <b>44</b> and exiting the exit port <b>48</b> to be readily controlled, by simply controlling the axial distance d between the inward facing surface <b>42</b><i>a </i>of valve sleeve <b>42</b> and the edge <b>47</b><i>a </i>of plenum opening <b>47</b> (i.e. the size of inlet opening <b>45</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Additionally, as air can be drawn into inlet region <b>49</b> from all around the cylindrical opening <b>45</b>, the airflow into region <b>49</b> and also through inlet <b>47</b> can be fairly uniform. The result is that no matter what the position of the valve sleeve <b>42</b>, the air flow into plenum <b>44</b> will be quite evenly distributed, thus providing relatively even loading on impeller <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">It may be appreciated that as a result of the compact nature of the inlet restriction and similar profile to existing blowers, blower <b>30</b> may be particularly suitable to be retrofitted in the drying section <b>22</b> of existing wash systems <b>10</b>. The ability to readily retrofit, results at least in part from the movement of the valve sleeve <b>42</b> that may be confined to the axial direction parallel to, and which may be aligned with, the fan blade axis of rotation. Additionally, blower <b>30</b> is particularly suitable for use in retrofitting existing drying sections because it can operative effectively in a number of different orientations. Therefore, a wash facility employing legacy blowers could be upgraded by simply replacing the legacy blowers with novel blowers <b>30</b>, coupled with suitable modifications to the control system.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">It should be noted that blower <b>30</b> may not require additional space above the plenum when compared to a standard blower found in most vehicle wash systems today. This can be important because blowers in existing systems may be positioned immediately above each other, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, or alternatively close to the facility roof. In either of these scenarios there may be insufficient space to install a modified blower <b>30</b> with a control system that requires additional space directly above the plenum.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Accurate control of the airflow exiting the blower <b>30</b> may also permit the drying section <b>22</b> conditions to be readily selected and optimized depending on the characteristics of the vehicle to be dried and also the location of the vehicle relative to the drying section <b>22</b>. For example, certain types of vehicles or components or parts of certain vehicles may be vulnerable to damage resulting from high velocity airflow including convertible roofs, and covers used with pickup trucks. A vehicle's position and/or certain characteristics of the vehicle may be determined by sensors such as for example, photo detectors. Sensors may also be employed to determine what type of vehicle from several different types of vehicles, is in the drying section of the vehicle wash system. The signals produced by the sensors may be transmitted to system controller <b>19</b> which can then operate the blowers in a predetermined manner that is appropriate for the vehicle position, characteristics or type. Alternatively, certain vehicle types and/or characteristics and other data may be manually inputted into the system by a car wash attendant or the vehicle occupants.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">It may also be desirable to vary the airflow exiting the blower <b>30</b> in response to the distance between vehicles in the wash system <b>10</b>, or the speed at which vehicles progress through the wash system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The ability to rapidly vary the airflow exiting a blower <b>30</b> automatically is particularly desirable when drying pickup trucks. As schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a pickup truck <b>100</b> has a hood <b>106</b>, a cab <b>108</b>, and a bed <b>110</b>. It may be desirable to operate a blower <b>30</b> under different conditions, for different parts of a pickup truck <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A high velocity airflow may be applied to the portions of a vehicle that are in a condition appropriate for drying until the vehicle is identified as a pickup truck. For example, it is generally desirable to operate a blower <b>30</b> in a first condition so that a high velocity and volume airflow exits the blower <b>30</b> for portions of a vehicle that are in a condition appropriate for drying. For a pickup truck <b>100</b>, a high velocity and volume airflow would be applied when the hood <b>106</b> and cab <b>108</b> are in a condition appropriate for drying, as the system may not initially be able to distinguish pickup trucks from other vehicle types.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Similarly, once the vehicle has been identified as a pickup truck <b>100</b>, it may be desirable to operate a blower <b>30</b> in a second condition so that a relatively low velocity airflow exits the blower <b>30</b> when the bed <b>110</b> of pickup truck <b>100</b> is in a condition appropriate for drying. Drying the bed <b>110</b> of pickup truck <b>100</b> with a relatively low velocity and volume airflow may be advantageous to substantially remove standing water from the bed of the pickup truck without substantially disturbing other materials already present in the bed of a pickup truck upon entering the wash facility. Such a method could be employed with a variety of blower systems, and it not intended to be limited to the particular structures explicitly described herein. However, using the system disclosed above, control system <b>19</b> may, upon receiving appropriate signals from sensors in the vehicle drying section, adjust the position of the valve sleeve <b>42</b> to modify the size of inlet opening <b>45</b>. Sensors can also be employed to determine that a vehicle is no longer in a condition appropriate for drying the vehicle. The system controller <b>19</b> can then, in response thereto, move the sleeve to vary the distance thereby closing the inlet opening <b>45</b> to substantially prevent air from being drawn through the inlet opening.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">It has been found that operating a blower <b>30</b> with a valve sleeve <b>42</b> in the fully &#x201c;closed&#x201d; position may in some embodiments be suitable for drying the bed of a pickup truck. Even with a valve sleeve <b>42</b> in the fully closed position, so that distance d is substantially zero or a very small distance, a residual airflow still may exit from a blower <b>30</b>. Accordingly, one or more blowers <b>30</b> in a drying section, may provide a sufficient airflow to adequately remove standing water the bed <b>110</b> of a pickup truck <b>100</b> with the valve sleeve <b>42</b> in the closed position without substantially disturbing other items in the bed <b>110</b>. As an aside, it should be noted that in the car wash industry the term &#x201c;to dry&#x201d; does not necessarily require that all traces of moisture be removed from a surface&#x2014;to dry a surface is means to remove at least at least some moisture from the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Alternatively, it may be desirable in certain applications to operate blower <b>30</b> with valve sleeve <b>42</b> translated a distance d, that is intermediate distance between the maximum and minimum displacements of the valve sleeve <b>42</b>, to provide a desired airflow to certain parts of a vehicle that is less than the maximum airflow when the valve sleeve <b>42</b> is fully open. When valve sleeve <b>42</b> is positioned at an intermediate position to dry certain parts of a vehicle, the blower may be operated in a total of three different conditions. Alternatively, the system controller can be programmed to control the movement of the sleeve <b>42</b> so that it can be set at more than three or more different positions to accommodate several desired drying conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In drying a pickup truck <b>100</b>, it may be necessary to distinguish between the bed <b>110</b> and other portions of a pickup truck <b>100</b>, when seeking to operate one or more blowers <b>30</b> under different conditions, each different condition dependent upon the portion of a pickup truck <b>100</b> that is in a condition appropriate for drying. More specifically, it may be of assistance to identify the transition between the cab <b>108</b> and the bed <b>110</b> of a pickup truck <b>100</b>, defined by the rear edge <b>104</b> of the cab <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">There are different known methods for identifying the presence of a pick up truck and locating the different locations of the cab and the bed. One method, suitable for use in a conveyor or tunnel type wash facility, to identify the rear edge <b>104</b> of the cab <b>108</b>, or more generally to distinguish between the cab <b>108</b> and bed <b>110</b> of a pickup truck <b>100</b>, is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The abrupt transition from cab <b>108</b> to bed <b>110</b> of a pickup truck <b>100</b> is a characteristic feature of pickup trucks and is useful in distinguishing pickup trucks from other vehicle types. Other suitable methods may be possible in a conveyor or tunnel type wash facility, or with suitable modification to a &#x201c;rollover&#x201d; type wash facility. The systems described and referenced below, and also other systems, may also operate in conjunction with other control systems and detection systems known in the art. For example, the distance between the rear edge <b>104</b> and the front of the pickup truck <b>100</b> may be determined by other means, and communicated to the drying section or system controller <b>19</b>, in order to operate blower <b>30</b> under different conditions for different parts of the pickup truck <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">More generally, the relationship between the upper and lower portions of a pickup truck may be used to distinguish pickup trucks from other vehicles. The upper portion of a pickup truck is generally comprised of a relatively short cab portion compared to the lower portion of the pickup truck, which generally corresponds to the overall vehicle length. By monitoring the relative lengths of the upper and lower portions of a vehicle, a pick up truck can be identified.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a photosource <b>94</b> and photodetector <b>96</b> may be configured in a circuit commonly known as an electronic eye, with a beam <b>95</b> transmitted by photosource <b>94</b> and received by photodetector <b>96</b>, as is known. Examples of suitable photosource and photodetector devices that may be employed are the model IR 110-2 made by MacNeil Wash Systems. If no object is present to interrupt beam <b>95</b>, beam <b>95</b> is said to be in the received state. If an object is positioned to prevent transmission of beam <b>95</b> from photosource <b>94</b> to photodetector <b>96</b>, beam <b>95</b> is said to be in the interrupted state. Similarly, photosource <b>90</b> and photodetector <b>92</b> may be connected so that beam <b>91</b> is transmitted by photosource <b>90</b> and may be received by photodetector <b>92</b> under certain conditions. Signals corresponding to the received and interrupted states can be transmitted on an ongoing basis to a system controller <b>19</b>. Photosources and photodetectors may be mounted to stanchions <b>98</b>, or otherwise suitably positioned in the wash system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Beam <b>95</b> may be used to detect the upper portion of a vehicle. Beam <b>91</b> may be used to detect the lower portion of a vehicle. Beam <b>91</b> may be inclined in order to provide a more accurate indication of when a vehicle is present. Having beam <b>91</b> inclined is advantageous as it minimizes the possibility of a portion of a vehicle being present and not detected. This could occur if beam <b>91</b> was transmitted through glass if beam <b>91</b> were not inclined so as to refract through any glass components of a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The relative proportions of the upper and lower portions of a vehicle may be measured by beams <b>95</b> and <b>91</b> and system controller <b>19</b> as a vehicle passes by stanchions <b>98</b> and past detection system <b>150</b>. The length or relative length of the upper portion of a vehicle may be defined by the cab portion, where the vehicle is a pickup truck <b>100</b>, since beam <b>95</b> will transition from the received state to the interrupted state as the front portion of cab <b>108</b> moves past beam <b>95</b>. Beam <b>95</b> will remain in the interrupted state until the rear edge <b>104</b> of cab <b>108</b> pass beam <b>95</b> and beam <b>95</b> transitions to the received state. The transitions of beam <b>95</b> from the received state to interrupted state and vice versa may be monitored by system controller <b>19</b>. It is not critical to calculate the actual length of the upper portion, as the lower portion will progress through beam <b>91</b> at the same rate, however, it is desirable for a pickup truck <b>100</b> to travel past detection system <b>150</b> at a constant rate to simplify calculations by system controller <b>19</b>. Similarly, the length or relative length of the lower portion may be determined by the transitions of beam <b>91</b> by other components of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">System controller <b>19</b> in conjunction with detection system <b>150</b> may then determine that a vehicle is a pickup truck by comparing the relative dimensions or times of passage of the upper and lower portions of the vehicle as it passes through beams <b>91</b> and <b>95</b>. If the upper portion of the vehicle/time is greater than U and the lower portion/time is greater than L a reliable indication that the vehicle present is a pickup truck may be determined. The specific dimensions of U and L are dependent upon the dimensions of pickup trucks currently being marketed by vehicle manufactures, and can be determined by persons skilled in the art or modified as the dimensions of pickup trucks change over time.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In other embodiments, ultrasonic range finders may be used to measure the height of an upper surface and thus determine the contour of the upper surface of a vehicle in order to detect a vehicle type, including identifying a pickup truck. A pickup truck may be determined by the abrupt transition at the rear edge <b>104</b> of the cab <b>108</b> by measuring the distance relative to at least two range finders as a vehicle progresses through a detection system. Upon detection of an abrupt transition the system may be able to recognize that a pickup truck is present and take appropriate action or transmit information to a system controller to be used in subsequent processing steps. More specifically, at least two range finders may be positioned in different transverse planes. Transverse planes as used herein may refer to a plane that is transverse to the direction of relative motion of a vehicle and a detection system. Further details of such one exemplary system using ultrasonic range finders is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,886,648, the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Another system employing ultrasonic range finders to detect vehicle types is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,173,692, the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. The disclosure of the '692 patent may be modified by a person skilled in the art to detect the abrupt transition typical of pickup trucks and take appropriate action in drying the pickup truck by persons skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Upon a vehicle being identified as a pickup truck, appropriate control information may then be directed by system controller <b>19</b> to one or more blowers <b>30</b> so that the blowers may be operated in one or more different conditions. Specifically, one or more blowers <b>30</b> may be adjusted from a first airflow rate appropriate for drying the hood <b>106</b> and cab <b>108</b> of pickup truck <b>110</b> to a second lower airflow rate appropriate for drying the bed <b>110</b> of pickup truck <b>110</b>. Additionally, controller <b>19</b> may, depending upon the specific condition identified, only cause selected blowers <b>30</b> of the entire group of blowers <b>30</b> to be operated.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Alternatively, in wash facilities having an attendant, the attendant can control the blower operation so that blower <b>30</b> or blowers <b>30</b> of drying section <b>22</b> are operated in a different condition to dry the bed <b>110</b> of a pickup <b>100</b>. The attendant may also modify the drying conditions for other types of vehicles or other factors such as the weather, time of day, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A variety of methods may be used to generate an input to the blower control system indicating that the blower should be in the operable or standby position. For example, the blower control system may interface with the wash system control system in order to obtain the necessary control information. Alternatively, sensing mechanisms, such as electronic eyes, may be employed independent of the wash system control system to determine the position of a vehicle in the wash system and respond appropriately by sending a signal directly to a controller or controllers associated with one or more blowers.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In summary, the blower configuration described above may regulate the airflow exiting the blower by controlling the airflow entering the blower at the inlet port while the blower motor is operated continuously. The blower configuration may also allow existing systems to be easily retrofitted because of its profile, compact design, and ability to be mounted in a variety of different orientations. Moreover, the blower configuration permits the size of the airflow inlet opening to be predictably varied by a linear change to an inlet control device. A benefit is that an appropriate setting for the size of the inlet area may easily be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The blower configuration described and illustrated herein, may be a relatively simple and compact design that can maintain a uniform load over the impeller and may not significantly disturb the air uniformity entering the cavity opening. Consequently, adequate durability and readily predictable performance may be obtained when the blower is operated over a range of operating conditions, rather than being limited to the maximum and minimum air flows provided by the blower.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The ability to sustainably and predictably operate a blower with a varied airflow employing a constant speed motor allows for optimization of the blower characteristics depending upon a number of factors, including the type of vehicle, the portion of the vehicle being cleaned, and the speed at which vehicles progress through the wash system.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The present blower configuration can also be more compact than known blower systems in imparting a uniform load over the impeller when in a partially open or closed position. The airflow entering the blower can remain relatively uniform, as the distance d varies, permitting the valve sleeve, or more generally the intake restriction means, to be positioned relatively closely to the impeller while maintaining adequate performance.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The blower and various methods of operation described above may be suitable for use in either a conveyor or tunnel type wash facility, and also in a &#x201c;rollover&#x201d; type wash facility. For example, the position in of a vehicle in a conveyor type wash facility may determine when it is in a condition appropriate for drying. Alternatively, in a &#x201c;rollover&#x201d; type wash facility, the vehicle may be in a condition appropriate for drying when other desired operations are completed.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Although not specifically described in detail herein, suitable modifications may be made to the embodiments described by persons skilled in the art depending on the type of wash facility, and otherwise, being used for a particular application. Of course, the foregoing embodiments are intended to be illustrative only and in no way limiting. The described embodiments of carrying out the invention are susceptible to many modifications of form, arrangement of parts, details and order of operation. The invention, rather, is intended to encompass all such modification within its scope, as defined by the claims.</p>
