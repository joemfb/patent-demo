<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Japanese patent application serial number 2010-004670, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to solenoid valves, each of which is mounted in a fuel vapor treating system for controlling an amount of the fuel vapor flowing in the fuel vapor treating system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A gas vehicle is equipped with a fuel vapor treating system for preventing fuel vapor vaporized in a fuel tank from flowing into the atmosphere. The fuel vapor treating system includes a canister filled with an adsorbent and temporally trapping the fuel vapor by adsorbing the fuel vapor onto the adsorbent. The fuel vapor treating system has valves, each of which is generally composed of a solenoid valve, for opening and closing pipes communicating the fuel tank, the canister and the atmosphere each other in order to control flow of the fuel vapor in the fuel vapor treating system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2005-291241 discloses a solenoid valve having a first valve member, a second valve member, a second valve seat for the second valve member, an electromagnetic driving member, a first pathway and a second pathway for receiving and discharging fluid therethrough. The second valve member has a first valve seat for the first valve member and defines a communicating pathway for communicating the first pathway and the second pathway. When the first valve member and the second valve member contact the first valve seat and the second valve seat, respectively, communication between the first pathway and the second pathway is blocked. When the electromagnetic driving member moves the first valve member away from the first valve seat while the second valve member is contacting the second valve seat, the first pathway and the second pathway are communicated with each other via the communicating pathway. In this state, when differential pressure between the first pathway and the second pathway decreases, the second valve member moves away from the second valve seat due to biasing force from a spring, which biases the second valve member. As a result, a valve-opening area for flowing the fuel vapor increases, and thus the flow rate of the fuel vapor flowing from the first pathway into the second pathway also increases.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There has been a need for improved solenoids capable of controlling flow rate of fluid.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One aspect according to this disclosure includes a solenoid valve including a valve housing defining a fluid pathway for flowing fluid therein, a first valve member configured to open and close the fluid pathway, a first biasing member biasing the first valve member in a direction for closing the fluid pathway, a second valve member configured to open and close the fluid pathway, a second biasing member biasing the second valve member in a direction for closing the fluid pathway, an pressing rod, and an electromagnetic driving member pressing the pressing rod against the first valve member and the second valve member sequentially in order to open the fluid pathway in stages.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with this aspect, it is able to sequentially and concisely open the first valve member and the second valve member. Thus, it is able to improve control accuracy as for flow rate in the fluid pathway.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A first embodiment of the present disclosure will be described. For convenience of explanation, a fuel vapor treating system for an engine (internal combustion engine) will be described at first, and then a flow control valve corresponding to a solenoid valve attached to the fuel vapor treating system will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view of the fuel vapor treating system.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an engine system <b>10</b> for automobile such as gasoline vehicle is provided with a fuel vapor treating system <b>12</b>. The engine system <b>10</b> has an engine <b>14</b>, and a fuel tank <b>15</b> for reserving fuel, which is provided to the engine <b>14</b>. The fuel tank <b>15</b> has an inlet pipe <b>16</b> having a fill opening. The inlet pipe <b>16</b> transports fuel from the fill opening into the fuel tank <b>15</b>. The fill opening, which is upper end of the inlet pipe <b>16</b>, is provided with a tank cap <b>17</b> in a removable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Inside of the fuel tank <b>15</b>, a fuel supply device <b>19</b> is provided. The fuel supply device <b>19</b> has a fuel pump <b>20</b>, a sender gage <b>21</b> and an internal pressure sensor <b>22</b>, etc. The fuel pump <b>20</b> suctions the fuel reserved in the fuel tank <b>15</b>, applies pressure on the fuel and then discharges it. The sender gage <b>21</b> detects a liquid level of the fuel. The internal pressure sensor <b>22</b> detects an internal pressure of the fuel tank <b>15</b>, which is pressure relative to the ambient pressure. The fuel pump <b>20</b> pumps the fuel from the fuel tank <b>15</b> through a fuel supply pipe <b>24</b> into the engine <b>14</b>, in particular, into a delivery pipe <b>26</b> having injectors (fuel injection valve) <b>25</b>, each of which corresponds to each combustion chambers. And then, the fuel is injected from the injectors <b>25</b> into an air intake pipe <b>27</b>. The air intake pipe <b>27</b> is connected with an air cleaner <b>28</b>, an airflow meter <b>29</b>, a throttle valve <b>30</b> and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The fuel vapor treating system <b>12</b> has a fuel vapor pipe <b>31</b>, a purge pipe <b>32</b> and a canister <b>34</b>. The fuel vapor pipe <b>31</b> has one end (at upstream side) communicated with a gaseous layer in the fuel tank <b>15</b> and the other end (at downstream side) connected with the canister <b>34</b>. The purge pipe <b>32</b> has one end (at upstream side) connected with the canister <b>34</b> and the other end (at downstream side) communicated with the air intake pipe <b>27</b> downstream of the throttle valve <b>30</b>. The canister <b>34</b> is filled with an adsorbent composed of activated carbon. The fuel vapor vaporized in the fuel tank <b>15</b> flows through the fuel vapor pipe <b>31</b> into the canister <b>34</b> and is adsorbed on the adsorbent (activated carbon) in the canister <b>34</b>. In the fuel tank <b>15</b>, the upstream end of the fuel vapor pipe <b>31</b> is provided with a fuel cut-off valve <b>35</b> and an on board refueling vapor recovery valve <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The fuel vapor pipe <b>31</b> has a flow control valve <b>38</b>. The flow control valve <b>38</b> is a solenoid valve, which opens and closes depending on signals from outside, i.e., an ECU <b>45</b> (described below). The flow control valve <b>38</b> is integrated with a relief valve <b>39</b>. The relief valve <b>39</b> is a mechanical bi-directional check valve having a forward directional relief valve, which opens when a pressure at the side connecting with the fuel tank <b>15</b> is higher by a predetermined value than a pressure at the other side connecting with the canister <b>34</b>, and a reverse directional relief valve, which opens when the pressure at the side connecting with the fuel tank <b>15</b> is lower by a predetermined value than the pressure at the other side connecting with the canister <b>34</b>. The purge pipe <b>32</b> has a purge valve <b>40</b> composed of a solenoid valve, which opens and closes depending on signals from the ECU <b>45</b> (described below).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The canister <b>34</b> is connected with an air pipe <b>42</b> via a switching valve <b>41</b>. The switching valve <b>41</b> communicates the canister <b>34</b> with the air pipe <b>42</b> in non-power distribution condition (OFF condition), and blocks such communication between the canister <b>34</b> and the air pipe <b>2</b> when signals are transmitted from the ECU <b>45</b>, i.e., in power distribution condition (ON condition). The air pipe <b>42</b> is equipped with an air filter <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The fuel vapor treating system <b>12</b> includes the ECU <b>45</b>. The ECU <b>45</b> is connected with the internal pressure sensor <b>22</b>, the flow control valve <b>38</b>, the purge valve <b>40</b>, the switching valve <b>41</b>, a lid switch <b>46</b>, a lid opener <b>47</b>, and a display <b>49</b>, etc. The lid opener <b>47</b> is connected with a manually-operated lid opening and closing device (not shown) for manually opening and closing a lid <b>48</b> covering the fill opening. The lid opener <b>47</b> is a lock system for the lid <b>48</b>, which unlocks the lid <b>48</b> when the lid opener <b>47</b> receives lid opening signals from the ECU <b>45</b> or when the manually-operated lid opening and closing device is operated in order to open the lid <b>48</b>. The lid switch <b>46</b> outputs signals for unlocking the lid <b>48</b> to the ECU <b>45</b>. Here, the ECU <b>45</b> corresponds to &#x201c;control circuit&#x201d; in this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Then, basic mechanism of the fuel vapor treating system <b>12</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">(1) During Parking</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the automobile is parked, the flow control valve <b>38</b> is kept in a closed state. Thus, when the internal pressure of the fuel tank <b>15</b> is lower than a predetermined pressure required for opening the relief valve <b>39</b> in the forward direction (positive pressure), the fuel vapor in the fuel tank <b>15</b> does not flow into the canister <b>34</b>. And, when the internal pressure of the fuel tank <b>15</b> is higher than a predetermined pressure required for opening the relief valve <b>39</b> in the reverse direction (negative pressure), air does not flow into the fuel tank <b>15</b>. Here, the purge valve <b>40</b> and the switching valve <b>41</b> are also closed.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">(2) During Refueling</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the lid switch <b>46</b> is operated during parking, the ECU <b>45</b> outputs signals in order to open the flow control valve <b>38</b>. At that time, in a case that the internal pressure of the fuel tank <b>15</b> is higher than the atmospheric pressure, the fuel vapor simultaneously flows into the canister <b>34</b> through the fuel vapor pipe <b>31</b> as soon as the flow control valve <b>38</b> opens, and then the fuel vapor is adsorbed on the adsorbent in the canister <b>34</b>. In this way, it is able to prevent the fuel vapor from releasing into the atmosphere. This leads decrease in the internal pressure of the fuel tank <b>15</b> to a value close to the atmospheric pressure. When the internal pressure of the fuel tank <b>15</b> decreases to the value close to the atmospheric pressure, the ECU <b>45</b> outputs signals for unlocking the lid <b>48</b> to the lid opener <b>47</b>. The lid opener <b>47</b> receives the signals and unlocks the lid <b>48</b>, so that the lid <b>48</b> can be opened. Then, after the lid <b>48</b> is opened and the tank cap <b>17</b> is removed, the fuel tank <b>15</b> is refueled. Here, because the tank cap <b>17</b> is removed after the internal pressure of the fuel tank <b>15</b> decreases to the value close to the atmospheric pressure, it is able to prevent the fuel vapor from releasing into the atmosphere from the fill opening. In addition, the ECU <b>45</b> keeps the flow control valve <b>38</b> in an open state till the refueling is over, in particular, the lid <b>48</b> is closed. Thus, the fuel vapor in the fuel tank <b>15</b> flows through the fuel vapor pipe <b>31</b> into the canister <b>34</b> and is trapped on the adsorbent in the canister <b>34</b> during refueling. Some of other gases in the fuel tank <b>15</b> also flow into the canister <b>34</b> through the fuel vapor pipe <b>31</b> and are trapped on the adsorbent in the canister <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">(3) During Driving</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When requirements for purge are met during driving, the ECU <b>45</b> outputs signals for purging the fuel vapor trapped in the canister <b>34</b>. In a state that the switching valve <b>41</b> is opened for communicating the canister <b>34</b> and the air pipe <b>42</b> each other, the purge valve <b>40</b> is controlled to be opened and closed due to such signals. When the purge valve <b>40</b> is opened, the engine <b>14</b> is communicated with the canister <b>34</b> via the purge pipe <b>32</b>. Because an internal pressure of the engine <b>14</b> is lower than that of the canister <b>34</b>, the fuel vapor in the canister <b>34</b> flows into the engine <b>14</b> via the air intake pipe <b>27</b> together with air suctioned from the air pipe <b>42</b>, and then is burned in the engine <b>14</b>. The ECU <b>45</b> keeps the flow control valve <b>38</b> in the open state during purge of the fuel vapor. Therefore, the internal pressure in the fuel tank <b>15</b> is kept to the value close to the atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Then, the flow control valve <b>38</b> will be described in detail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross sectional view showing the flow control valve. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross sectional view showing a main portion of the flow control valve. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross sectional view along a line IV-IV in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross sectional view along a line V-V in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a cross sectional view along a line VI-VI in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. For convenience of explanation, each directions, i.e., upper, lower, left and right directions, are defined based on the cross sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the flow control valve <b>38</b> has a valve housing <b>51</b>. The valve housing <b>51</b> has a first connecting pipe <b>53</b> extending rightward from a right surface of the valve housing <b>51</b>. The first connecting pipe <b>53</b> defines a first pathway <b>54</b> therein. The valve housing <b>51</b> has a second connecting pipe <b>56</b> extending leftward from a left surface of the valve housing <b>51</b>. The second connecting pipe <b>56</b> defines a second pathway <b>57</b> therein.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the valve housing <b>51</b> has a cylindrical wall <b>59</b> in a hollow cylindrical shape (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) in a central region of the valve housing <b>51</b>. The cylindrical wall <b>59</b> defines a valve chamber <b>60</b> therein. The valve chamber <b>60</b> is communicated with the first pathway <b>54</b> via a lower opening of the cylindrical wall <b>59</b>. The cylindrical wall <b>59</b> has an upper opening, which is closed with a second valve seat <b>62</b> in a circular plate shape. The second valve seat <b>62</b> has a lower surface for contacting and receiving a valve. The second valve seat <b>62</b> concentrically defines a second valve aperture <b>63</b> in a circular shape, which penetrates the second valve seat <b>62</b> in a vertical direction. The valve chamber <b>60</b> and the second pathway <b>57</b> are communicated with each other via the second valve aperture <b>63</b>. Here, the first pathway <b>54</b>, the second pathway <b>55</b> and the valve chamber <b>60</b> configure a fluid pathway <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The fluid pipe <b>64</b> of the flow control valve <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is interposed in the fuel vapor pipe <b>31</b> communicating the fuel tank <b>15</b> and the canister <b>34</b> in the fuel vapor treating system <b>12</b>. In detail, the first connecting pipe <b>53</b> (the first pathway <b>54</b>) is connected with an upstream portion of the fuel vapor pipe <b>31</b> (closer to the fuel tank <b>15</b>), whereas the second connecting pipe <b>56</b> (the second pathway <b>57</b>) is connected with a downstream portion of the fuel vapor pipe <b>31</b> (closer to the canister <b>34</b>). Thus, when the flow control valve <b>38</b> is opened, the fuel vapor from the fuel tank <b>15</b> flows through the fluid pathway <b>64</b> into the canister <b>34</b>. And, when the flow control valve <b>38</b> is closed, the fuel vapor from the fuel tank <b>15</b> does not flow through the fluid pathway <b>64</b> into the canister <b>34</b>. In addition, the valve housing <b>51</b> can be fixed on a vehicle body (not shown) by a bolt or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, inside the valve chamber <b>60</b>, a first valve member <b>67</b> and a second valve member <b>65</b> are concentrically disposed (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) such that they can move in the vertical direction. The second valve member <b>65</b>, which is positioned above the first valve member <b>67</b>, has a valve plate <b>69</b> as a main body in a circular plate shape corresponding to the second valve seat <b>62</b> of the valve housing <b>51</b>. The valve plate <b>69</b> is moved downwardly from the second valve seat <b>62</b> in order to open the second valve aperture <b>63</b> of the second valve seat <b>62</b>, and is moved upwardly and is contacted with the second valve seat <b>62</b> in order to close the second valve aperture <b>63</b>. The valve plate <b>69</b> has a second sealing member <b>70</b> composed of an O-ring, which elastically contacts with the second valve seat <b>62</b>, at an upper surface of the valve plate <b>69</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the valve plate <b>69</b> of the second valve member <b>65</b> has an inner cylindrical portion <b>72</b> and an outer cylindrical portion <b>73</b>, which are concentrically formed in a double hollow cylindrical shape and extend downwardly from an outer circumference of the valve seat <b>69</b>. The outer cylindrical portion <b>73</b> has an outer diameter smaller than an inner diameter of the cylindrical wall. <b>59</b> of the valve housing <b>51</b>. The outer cylindrical portion <b>73</b> is disposed inside the cylindrical wall <b>59</b> movably in an axial direction, i.e., the vertical direction, and there is an empty space between the cylindrical wall <b>59</b> and the outer cylindrical portion <b>73</b>. Here, the cylindrical wall <b>59</b> of the valve housing <b>51</b> and the outer cylindrical portion <b>73</b> of the second valve member <b>65</b> corresponds to &#x201c;second guide member&#x201d; for guiding the second valve member <b>65</b> in the vertical direction, i.e., an opening direction and a closing direction.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a ring space between the inner cylindrical portion <b>72</b> and the outer cylindrical portion <b>73</b> of the second valve member <b>65</b>, a second coil spring <b>75</b> composed of a coil spring is disposed.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the outer cylindrical portion <b>73</b> of the second valve member <b>65</b> is provided with a plurality (four in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of gaps <b>76</b>, which are positioned at regular intervals in a circumferential direction and extends along an axial direction of the outer cylindrical portion <b>73</b>. Thus, the outer cylindrical portion <b>73</b> is divided into the plurality (four in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of arc-shaped sections equally spaced in the circumferential direction. The gaps <b>76</b> extend upwardly such that they penetrate the outer circumference of the valve plate <b>69</b>, which is connected with the outer cylindrical portion <b>73</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Therefore, an upper flow pathway above the valve plate <b>69</b> and a lower flow pathway below the valve plate <b>69</b> in the valve chamber <b>60</b> are communicated with each other via the gaps <b>76</b>. Here, based on a flow direction of the fuel vapor (fluid) in the fluid pathway <b>64</b>, the lower flow pathway below the valve plate <b>69</b> corresponds to &#x201c;an upstream side in a fluid pathway&#x201d;, and the upper flow pathway above the valve plate <b>69</b> corresponds to &#x201c;a downstream side in a fluid pathway&#x201d;.</p>

The axis of the pressing rod <b>98</b> is positioned concentrically with the cylindrical wall <b>59</b> of the valve housing <b>51</b>, the second valve member <b>65</b> and the first valve member <b>67</b>. The step motor <b>90</b> is controlled by the ECU <b>45</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Here, the step motor <b>90</b> is called as stepper motor or stepping motor, etc., and corresponds to &#x201c;electromagnetic driving member&#x201d; in this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the pressing rod <b>98</b> has a lower end penetrating an upper wall of the valve housing <b>51</b> and extending near the second valve aperture <b>63</b> of the second valve seat <b>62</b>. On the lower end of the pressing rod <b>98</b>, a pressing plate <b>99</b> in a circular plate shape is formed concentrically. The pressing plate <b>99</b> is placed substantially parallel to the valve plate <b>69</b> of the valve member <b>65</b> such that a lower surface of the pressing plate <b>99</b> is directed toward an upper surface of the valve plate <b>69</b> and the protruding shaft <b>87</b> of the first valve member <b>67</b>. The pressing plate <b>99</b> has an outer diameter, which is larger than the outer diameter of the pressing rod <b>98</b> and the diameter of the first valve aperture <b>79</b> of the second valve member <b>65</b> and is smaller than the diameter of the second valve aperture <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Then, action of the flow control valve <b>38</b> will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic view showing the flow control valve in a closed state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a schematic view of the flow control valve where the first valve member is in an open state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a schematic view of the flow control valve where the second valve member is in an open state.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">During parking, the second valve member <b>65</b> and the first valve member <b>67</b> of the flow control valve <b>38</b> are respectively kept in the closed state due to the coil springs <b>75</b> and <b>86</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In this condition, the pressing rod <b>98</b> of the step motor <b>90</b> is in a retracted position (upper position), and the pressing plate <b>99</b> of the pressing rod <b>98</b> is positioned away from the valve plate <b>69</b> of the second valve member <b>65</b> and the protruding shaft <b>87</b> of the first valve member <b>67</b>. The protruding shaft <b>87</b> of the first valve member <b>67</b> has an upper end protruding above the valve plate <b>69</b> of the second valve member <b>65</b>. The second valve member <b>65</b> closes the second valve aperture <b>63</b> of the second valve seat <b>62</b> of the valve housing <b>51</b>. The first valve member <b>67</b> closes the first valve aperture <b>79</b> of the first valve seat <b>78</b> of the second valve member <b>65</b>. Thus, when both of the first valve member <b>67</b> and the second valve member <b>65</b> are closed, communication between the first pathway <b>45</b> and the second pathway <b>57</b> of the fluid pathway <b>64</b> in the valve housing <b>51</b> is blocked. In such condition, the fuel vapor vaporized in the fuel tank <b>15</b> does not flow from the fuel vapor pipe <b>31</b> into the canister <b>34</b> in the fuel vapor treating system <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In order to flow a small amount of the fuel vapor from the fuel tank <b>15</b> through the fuel vapor pipe <b>31</b> into the canister <b>34</b> while the vehicle is moving, the ECU <b>45</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) transmits the signals for opening the valve to the step motor <b>90</b> of the flow control valve <b>38</b> such that the rotor <b>97</b> is rotated in a direction for opening the valve. Thus, the pressing rod <b>98</b> moves downwardly from the retracted position (the upper position) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). The pressing rod <b>98</b> (including the pressing plate <b>99</b>) presses the protruding shaft <b>87</b> of the first valve member <b>67</b> downwardly, so that the first valve member <b>67</b> opens (moves downwardly) against biasing force from the first coil spring <b>86</b>. That is, when the valve plate <b>81</b> of the first valve member <b>67</b> moves away from the first valve seat <b>78</b> of the second valve member <b>65</b>, the first valve aperture <b>79</b> of the first valve seat <b>78</b> is opened. Here, the position of the pressing rod <b>98</b> in this state is called as first advance position (first lower position).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Therefore, the first pathway <b>54</b> and the second pathway <b>57</b> of the fluid pathway <b>64</b> in the valve housing <b>51</b> are communicated with each other via empty spaces between the second valve member <b>65</b> and the first valve member <b>67</b>, which are composed of a ring space between the inner cylindrical portion <b>72</b> of the second valve member <b>65</b> and the guide cylindrical portion <b>84</b> of the first valve member <b>67</b>, an empty space between the valve plate <b>69</b> of the second valve member <b>65</b> and the valve plate <b>81</b> of the first valve member <b>67</b>, a ring space between a wall defining the first valve aperture <b>79</b> and the protruding shaft <b>87</b>, and a ring space between a wall defining the second valve aperture <b>63</b> of the second valve seat <b>62</b> of the valve housing <b>51</b> and the pressing rod <b>98</b> (including the pressing plate <b>99</b>). Accordingly, the fuel vapor vaporized in the fuel tank <b>15</b> flows through the fuel vapor pipe <b>31</b> into the canister <b>34</b> in the fuel vapor treating system <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The amount of the fuel vapor flowing through the fuel vapor pipe <b>31</b> depends on an opening area opened by the first valve member <b>67</b>, in detail, a minimum opening area in the spaces between the second valve member <b>65</b> and the first valve member <b>67</b> (for example, an opening area of the ring space between the wall defining the first valve aperture <b>79</b> and the protruding shaft <b>87</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In order to flow a large amount of the fuel vapor from the fuel tank <b>15</b> through the fuel vapor pipe <b>31</b> into the canister <b>34</b> during moving, refueling or the like, the ECU <b>45</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) further transmits the signals for opening the valve to the step motor <b>90</b> of the flow control valve <b>38</b> such that the rotor <b>97</b> is additionally rotated in the direction for opening the valve. Thus, the pressing rod <b>98</b> advances (moves downwardly) from the first advance position (the first lower position) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). The pressing rod <b>98</b> (including the pressing plate <b>99</b>) presses the valve plate <b>69</b> of the second valve member <b>65</b> downwardly in addition to the protruding shaft <b>87</b> of the first valve member <b>67</b>, and thus the second valve member <b>65</b> opens (moves downwardly) against a biasing force from the second coil spring <b>75</b>. That is, when the valve plate <b>69</b> of the second valve member <b>65</b> moves away from the second valve seat <b>62</b> of the valve housing <b>51</b>, the second valve aperture <b>63</b> of the second valve seat <b>62</b> is opened. Here, the position of the pressing rod <b>98</b> in this state is called as a second advance position (a second lower position).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Therefore, the first pathway <b>54</b> and the second pathway <b>57</b> of the fluid pathway <b>64</b> in the valve housing <b>51</b> are communicated with each other via empty spaces between the valve housing <b>51</b> and the second valve member <b>65</b>, which are composed of an empty space between the cylindrical wall <b>59</b> of the valve housing <b>51</b> and a side wall of the second valve member <b>65</b> defining the gaps <b>76</b>, an empty space between the second valve seat <b>62</b> and the valve plate <b>69</b> of the second valve member <b>65</b>, and a ring space between a wall defining the second valve aperture <b>63</b> of the second valve seat <b>62</b> of the valve housing <b>51</b> and the pressing rod <b>98</b> (including the pressing plate <b>99</b>). Thus, the fuel vapor vaporized in the fuel tank <b>15</b> flows through the fuel vapor pipe <b>31</b> into the canister <b>34</b> in the fuel vapor treating system <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The amount of the fuel vapor flowing through the fuel vapor pipe <b>31</b> depends on an opening area opened by the second valve member <b>65</b>, in detail, a minimum opening area in the spaces between the cylindrical wall <b>59</b> of the valve housing <b>51</b> and the second valve member <b>65</b> of the second valve seat <b>62</b> (for example, an opening area of the ring space between the wall defining the second valve aperture <b>63</b> and the pressing rod <b>98</b> (including the pressing plate <b>99</b>)).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The opening area of the first valve member <b>67</b>, i.e., an opening area opened and closed by the first valve member <b>67</b>, is larger than that of the second valve member <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the valve opening state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>), the step motor <b>90</b> of the flow control valve <b>38</b> receives the signals for closing the valve, and then rotates the rotor <b>97</b> in a direction for closing the valve in order to retract (move upwardly) the pressing rod <b>98</b>. As a result, the flow control valve <b>38</b> is returned to the valve closing state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The flow control valve <b>38</b> has the pressing rod <b>98</b>, which is reciprocated by the step motor <b>90</b>, and the first valve member <b>67</b> and the second valve member <b>65</b> for opening and closing the fluid pathway <b>64</b> which the fuel vapor (fluid) flows through. The first valve member <b>67</b> and the second valve member <b>65</b> are biased in the direction for closing the fluid pathway <b>64</b> due to the coil springs <b>86</b> and <b>75</b>, respectively. The first valve member <b>67</b> and the second valve member <b>65</b> are sequentially opened due to the pressing rod <b>98</b> advanced by the step motor <b>90</b>. Therefore, it is able to precisely open the first valve member <b>67</b> and the second valve member <b>65</b> in turns due to advancing movement of the pressing rod <b>98</b>. Therefore, it is able to improve control of the flow rate compared with the known solenoid valve.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In addition, because the single step motor <b>90</b> can move the two valve members <b>65</b> and <b>67</b>, it is able to reduce size, weight and manufacturing cost for the flow control valve <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The step motor <b>90</b> can be used as the electromagnetic driving member. Thus, it is able to simplify configurations of the flow control valve <b>38</b> and the ECU <b>45</b> and to reduce the manufacturing cost, the weights and the sizes for the flow control valve <b>38</b> and the ECU <b>45</b> compared with the known solenoid valve, which controls the flow rate due to duty-cycle control (on-off control) of the electromagnetic driving member. In addition, in a case of the known solenoid valve (refer to JP2005-291241A), when fixing the valve housing <b>51</b> on a vehicle body, it is necessary to provide an anti-vibration member such as air damper, rubber bush or the like for reducing noise generated due to the duty-cycle control. On the other hand, in the case of the flow control valve <b>38</b> of this disclosure, because the anti-vibration member can be omitted or simplified, it is able to decrease the number of parts, the manufacturing cost and installation space for the flow control valve <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The opening area opened and closed by the first valve member <b>67</b> in the fluid pathway <b>64</b> is smaller than the opening area opened and closed by the second valve member <b>65</b> in the fluid pathway <b>64</b>. Thus, the first valve member <b>67</b> is opened for flowing the small amount of the fuel vapor, whereas the second valve member <b>65</b> is opened for flowing the large amount of the fuel vapor.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The first valve aperture <b>79</b> communicating the upstream side and the downstream side of the fluid pathway <b>64</b> is formed in the second valve member <b>65</b> and is closed and opened by the first valve member <b>67</b>. Accordingly, it is able to mount the first valve member <b>67</b> on the second valve member <b>65</b> compactly compared with a configuration where individual fluid pathways are independently opened and closed by valve members. Therefore, it is able to reduce the size and the weight of the flow control valve <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The first guide member (the inner cylindrical portion <b>72</b> of the second valve member <b>65</b> and the guide cylindrical portion <b>84</b> of the first valve member <b>67</b>) guiding the first valve member <b>67</b> in the opening and closing directions is provided between the first valve member <b>67</b> and the second valve member <b>65</b>. Thus, it is able to stabilize movement of the first valve member <b>67</b> relative to the second valve member <b>65</b> in the opening and closing directions (axial direction).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The second guide member (the cylindrical wall <b>59</b> of the valve housing <b>51</b> and the outer cylindrical portion <b>73</b> of the second valve member <b>65</b>) guiding the second valve member <b>65</b> in the opening and closing directions is provided between the second valve member <b>65</b> and the lower portion of the valve housing <b>51</b>. Thus, it is able to stabilize movement of the second valve member <b>65</b> relative to the valve housing <b>51</b> in the opening and closing directions (axial direction).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In addition, at least one of the first guide member and the second guide member can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The first coil spring <b>86</b> and the second coil spring <b>75</b> concentrically placed in a double ring manner correspond to the first biasing member biasing the first valve member <b>67</b> in the closing direction and the second biasing member biasing the second valve member <b>65</b> in the closing direction, respectively. The first guide member (the inner cylindrical portion <b>72</b> of the second valve member <b>65</b> and the guide cylindrical portion <b>84</b> of the first valve member <b>67</b>) is disposed between the first coil spring <b>86</b> and the second coil spring <b>75</b> in the radial direction. Accordingly, it is able to place the first coil spring <b>86</b>, the second coil spring <b>75</b> and the first guide member compactly. Thus, it is able to reduce the size and the weight of the flow control valve <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The fuel vapor treating system <b>12</b> has the flow control valve <b>38</b> such that the fluid pathway <b>64</b> of the flow control valve <b>38</b> is interposed into the fuel vapor pipe <b>31</b> communicating the fuel tank <b>15</b> and the canister <b>34</b>. Thus, because the flow control valve <b>38</b> concisely regulates the flow rate of the fuel vapor flowing through the fuel vapor pipe <b>31</b> while purging the fuel vapor, it is able to prevent disturbance in air-fuel ratio (A/F).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A second embodiment of this disclosure will be described. This embodiment substantially corresponds to the first embodiment further including some modifications.

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The flow control valve <b>38</b> of this embodiment has a straight pressing rod <b>101</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) instead of the pressing rod <b>98</b> having the pressing plate <b>99</b> in the first embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Because the shape of the pressing rod <b>101</b> is simplified, it is able to reduce manufacturing cost for the pressing rod <b>101</b>. The pressing rod <b>101</b> has an outer diameter, which is larger than the diameter of the first valve aperture <b>79</b> of the second valve member <b>65</b> and is smaller than the diameter of the second valve aperture <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The flow control valve <b>38</b> of this embodiment has a first connecting pipe <b>103</b> extending downwardly from a lower surface of the valve housing <b>51</b> instead of the first connecting pipe <b>53</b> of the first embodiment.

The outer diameter of the pressing rod <b>111</b> is smaller than the diameter of the first valve aperture <b>79</b> of the second valve member <b>65</b>.

The pressing rod <b>111</b> has a pressing flange <b>112</b>, which is formed in a circular plate shape, at a predetermined distance from the lower end of the pressing rod <b>111</b>.
