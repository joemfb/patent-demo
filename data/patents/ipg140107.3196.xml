<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an active matrix light emitting device. More specifically, the invention relates to a structure of the part from which luminescence is extracted.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A light emitting device using luminescence out of an electroluminescent element (a light emitting element) attracts attention as a display device of wide viewing angle and low power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are an active matrix type and a passive matrix type as driving methods for a light emitting device which is mainly used for display. In a light emitting device of an active matrix type driving method, emission state, non-emission state or the like can be controlled in every light emitting element. Therefore, it can be driven with smaller power consumption than a passive matrix light emitting device, and it is suitable for being mounted not only as a display portion of a small electric appliance such as a mobile phone but also as a display portion of a large-size television receiver or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, in an active matrix light emitting device, each light emitting element is provided with a circuit for controlling the drive of the respective light emitting element. The circuit and the light emitting element are disposed over a substrate so that extraction of luminescence to the outside is not prevented by the circuit. Light-transmitting insulating layers are laminated in a part superposing with the light emitting element, and luminescence is emitted outside through the insulating layer. These insulating layers are provided in order to form a transistor which is a component of the circuit, a circuit element such as a capacitor element or a wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Luminescence sometimes interferes each other multiple times according to the difference in a refractive index of each insulating layer. As a result, a problem that an emission spectrum varies depending on a viewing angle with respect to a side from which luminescence is extracted and visibility of an image displayed in the light emitting device is deteriorated is caused.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, deterioration in visibility of an image due to the difference of a refractive index of each layer occurs also in a passive matrix display device. For example, Reference 1: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 7-211458 raises a problem that external light and luminescence are reflected at an interface due to the difference of a refractive index of each layer which constitutes a light emitting element, and visibility is deteriorated. Patent Document 1 also suggests a light emitting element with an element structure capable of solving the above problem.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An object of the present invention is to provide a light emitting device in which variations in an emission spectrum depending on a viewing angle with respect to a side from which luminescence is extracted are reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to one aspect of the invention, the light emitting device has a transistor, an insulating layer covering the transistor and a light emitting element provided in an opening in the insulating layer.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Note that the insulating layer may be a single layer or a multilayer in which a plurality of layers including different substances is laminated.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A light emitting device according to the invention has a transistor, a light emitting element, an insulating layer covering the transistor and a bank layer covering the insulating layer. A first opening is provided in the insulating layer. In addition, a second opening is provided in the bank layer. The second opening is provided inside of the first opening, and the light emitting element is provided in the second opening.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Note that the insulating layer may be a single layer or a multilayer in which a plurality of layers including different substances is laminated.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A light emitting device according to the invention has a transistor and an insulating layer covering the transistor. The insulating layer has a first opening, and a first electrode is provided so as to cover the first opening. Further, a bank layer covering the insulating layer is provided. The bank layer has a second opening. In the second opening, a part of the first electrode is exposed. A light emitting layer is provided over the first electrode which is exposed from the second opening, and a second electrode is provided on the light emitting element.</p>

In addition, the connecting portion is connected to the transistor through a contact hole penetrating the insulating layer. Moreover, the first electrode is formed of a conductive substance having light transmitting properties.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Note that the insulating layer may be a single layer or a multilayer in which a plurality of layers including different substances is laminated.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A light emitting device according to the invention has a light emitting element and a transistor. The light emitting element is formed over a first insulating layer such that a light emitting layer is sandwiched between a first electrode and a second electrode. In addition, the transistor is formed over a second insulating layer provided on the first insulating layer such that a third insulating layer is sandwiched between a semiconductor layer and a third electrode. Moreover, the transistor is covered with a fourth insulating layer. The third insulating layer has an opening, and the light emitting element is provided in the opening. Further, the first electrode and the semiconductor layer are provided in the same layer.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Here, the semiconductor layer and the first electrode are connected electronically through a connecting portion. The connecting portion is connected to the transistor though a contact hole penetrating the insulating layer. In addition, the first electrode formed from a conductive substance having light transmitting properties.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Note that the third insulating layer may be a single layer or a multilayer in which a plurality of layers including different substances is laminated.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the invention, a light emitting device in which variations in an emission spectrum depending on a viewing angle with respect to a side from which luminescence is extracted are reduced can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition, by reducing variations in an emission spectrum depending on a viewing angle with respect to a side from which luminescence is extracted, a display device or the like capable of providing an image with superior visibility can be obtained.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A light emitting device according to the present invention is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">An insulating layer <b>12</b> having two-layers of insulating layers <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>is provided over a substrate <b>11</b>. On the insulating layer <b>12</b><i>b</i>, a staggered transistor <b>17</b> including a semiconductor layer <b>14</b><i>a</i>, a gate insulating layer <b>15</b> and a gate electrode <b>16</b> is provided. In addition, the transistor <b>17</b> is covered with an insulating layer <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Here, an object having light-transmitting properties such as glass or quartz is used for the substrate <b>11</b>. In addition, an object having flexibility such as plastics may be used for the substrate <b>11</b>. Besides, any object can be used for the substrate <b>11</b> as long as it has light-transmitting properties and functions as a support medium for supporting the transistor <b>17</b> and a light emitting element <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this embodiment, the insulating layers <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>are provided in order to prevent impurities which diffuse from the substrate <b>11</b> from being mixed into the transistor <b>17</b>. The insulating layers <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>include different substances, respectively. Note that the insulating layers <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>are preferably include a layer composed of silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon nitride containing oxygen or the like. Alternatively, they may be layers including other materials. Although the insulating layer <b>12</b> is a multilayer in this embodiment, it may be a single layer. Additionally, when the mixture of impurities from the substrate <b>11</b> is restrained sufficiently, it is not particularly necessary to provide the insulating layer <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The light emitting element <b>24</b> is formed on an insulating layer <b>12</b><i>a </i>such that a light emitting layer <b>22</b> is sandwiched between a first electrode <b>20</b> and a second electrode <b>23</b>. The first electrode <b>20</b> contacts with the insulating layer <b>12</b><i>a</i>. Additionally, it is more preferable that the insulating layer <b>12</b><i>a </i>is a film having a function of preventing impurities from diffusing as described above and includes a substance of which a refractive index is equal to or a smaller than that of the first electrode <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Note that one of the first electrode <b>20</b> and the second electrode <b>23</b> functions as an anode, and the other functions as a cathode. Additionally, it is preferable that the first electrode <b>20</b> includes a conductive substance having light-transmitting properties such as indium tin oxide (ITO). Note that ITO containing silicon oxide, IZO (Indium Zinc Oxide) in which zinc oxide (ZnO) of 2% to 20% is mixed into indium tin oxide, or the like may be used as well as ITO.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The light emitting layer <b>22</b> includes a light emitting substance and is formed of a single layer or a multilayer. In addition, the light emitting layer <b>22</b> may be an object including either an inorganic material or an organic material; alternatively, it may be an object including both of the above.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The transistor <b>17</b> and the light emitting element <b>24</b> are electronically connected through a connecting portion <b>19</b><i>a </i>including a conductor. Note that the connecting portion <b>19</b><i>a </i>is provided on the insulating layer <b>18</b>, and further reaches the semiconductor layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>through a contact hole penetrating the insulating layer <b>18</b>. In addition, a part or entire part of the connecting portion <b>19</b><i>a </i>is in contact with the first electrode <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A first opening is provided in the insulating layer <b>18</b> such that a part of the insulating layer <b>12</b><i>a </i>is exposed. Then, the first electrode <b>20</b> is provided so as to cover the first opening. Note that it is not always necessary to cover the entire opening with the first electrode <b>20</b> as long as the first electrode <b>20</b> is provided so as to cover the insulating layer <b>12</b><i>a </i>exposed from the opening. Further, a bank layer <b>21</b> having the second opening is provided so as to expose a part of the first electrode <b>20</b>. In addition, the other part (the connecting portion <b>19</b><i>a</i>, a wiring <b>19</b><i>b</i>, the insulating layer <b>18</b> and the like) are covered with the bank layer <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the second opening, the light emitting layer <b>22</b> is provided on the first electrode <b>20</b>, and further, the second electrode <b>23</b> is provided on the light emitting layer <b>22</b>. The part in which the first electrode <b>20</b>, the light emitting layer <b>22</b> and the second electrode <b>23</b> are laminated in this manner functions as the light emitting element <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In addition, in a light emitting device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the connecting portion <b>19</b><i>a </i>and the first electrode <b>20</b> are laminated over a sidewall of the insulating layer <b>18</b>. By adopting such a structure, the connection between the first electrode <b>20</b> and the connecting portion <b>19</b><i>a </i>can be kept even when either the first electrode <b>20</b> or the connecting portion <b>19</b><i>a </i>cannot cover the sidewall of the insulating layer <b>18</b> sufficiently. Moreover, like a light emitting device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a film <b>19</b><i>d </i>formed in the same layer as the connecting portion <b>19</b><i>a </i>may be provided so as to cover the entire sidewall of the insulating layer <b>18</b>. Note that the connecting portion <b>19</b><i>a </i>and the film <b>19</b><i>d </i>may be formed either integrally with each other or not.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Note that the insulating layer <b>18</b> may have multilayer structure including a plurality of layers, or a single layer structure. In addition, the insulating layer <b>18</b> may include either an inorganic materials such as silicon oxide, siloxane or silicon nitride or an organic materials such as acryl or polyimide. The insulating layer <b>18</b> may include both an inorganic material and an organic material. In either case, it is acceptable as long as the material is the insulator.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In a light emitting device according to the invention, both of the transistor <b>17</b> and the light emitting element <b>24</b> are provided over the insulator such as the insulating layer <b>12</b><i>a </i>or <b>12</b><i>b</i>. Moreover, particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the semiconductor layers <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>are provided on the insulating layer <b>12</b><i>b</i>, and the first electrode <b>20</b> is provided over the insulating layer <b>12</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the semiconductor layers <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>and the first electrode <b>20</b> may be provided over the different layers or on the same layer. For example, the semiconductor layers <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>may be provided on the insulating layer <b>12</b><i>a</i>, or the first electrode <b>20</b> may be provided over the insulating layer <b>12</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Here, when the insulating layers <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>are formed between the substrate <b>11</b> and the first electrode <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the substrate <b>11</b> and the insulating layers <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>are preferably selected to have almost the same refractive index. Alternatively, it is preferable that the insulating layers <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>laminated so that each refractive index is sequentially decreased and the refractive index of the substrate <b>11</b> is the smallest. In either case, any structure is acceptable as long as it is such a structure in which the transistor <b>17</b> and the light emitting element <b>24</b> are provided over the insulator, and diffusion of impurities from the substrate <b>11</b> to the transistor <b>17</b> can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In addition, it is not always necessary to provide the film <b>19</b><i>d</i>. For example, a light emitting device in which the film <b>19</b><i>d </i>is not provided like a light emitting device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is acceptable. In a light emitting device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a semiconductor layer <b>14</b><i>b </i>is provided so as to surround the first electrode <b>20</b> in the same layer as a semiconductor layer <b>14</b><i>a</i>. However, like a light emitting device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for example, a light emitting device having a structure without the semiconductor layer <b>14</b><i>b </i>surrounding the first electrode <b>20</b> is acceptable.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Note that a structure of the transistor <b>17</b> is not particularly limited. The transistor <b>17</b> may be a single gate type or a multi-gate type. In addition, the transistor <b>17</b> may have a single drain structure, an LDD (Lightly Doped Drain) structure or a structure in which an LDD region and a gate electrode are overlapped with each other.</p>

Note that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a part of the cross section taken along a dotted line A-A&#x2032; is shown in a cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Therefore, as for the parts corresponding to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the same reference numerals are used as those used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. That is, reference numeral <b>14</b> denotes a semiconductor layer; <b>16</b>, a gate electrode; <b>19</b><i>b</i>, a wiring; and <b>19</b><i>a</i>, a connecting portion. Additionally, reference numeral <b>20</b> denotes a first electrode; and <b>21</b>, a bank layer. Further, although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, reference numerals <b>19</b><i>c</i>, <b>29</b><i>a </i>and <b>29</b><i>b </i>denote wirings; and <b>27</b> and <b>28</b>, transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the aforementioned light emitting device, luminescence out of the light emitting element <b>24</b> is emitted outside through the first electrode <b>20</b>, the insulating layer <b>12</b> and the substrate <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In a light emitting device according to the invention described above, the number of layers through which luminescence passes are reduced when luminescence out of a light emitting element is extracted outside. Thus, in an interface between layers, the number of time that the luminescence out of the light emitting element reflects and the amount of the reflection are reduced. As a result multiple interference due to reflected light is controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As described above, a light emitting device according to the invention has such a structure enabling control of multiple interference, and a light emitting device with preferable visibility in which variations in an emission spectrum depending on a viewing angle with respect to a side from which luminescence is extracted are decreased.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A method for manufacturing a light emitting device according to the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">After laminating insulating layers <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>over a substrate <b>11</b> sequentially, a semiconductor layer is further laminated on the insulating layer <b>12</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Next, the semiconductor layer is processed in a desired shape to form semiconductor layers <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>. As for the processing, the semiconductor layer <b>14</b> is etched by using a resist mask.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Next, a gate insulating layer <b>15</b> covering the semiconductor layers <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>and the insulating layer <b>12</b><i>b </i>and the like is formed, and a conductive layer is further laminated on the gate insulating layer <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Next, the conductive layer is processed in a desired shape, and a gate electrode <b>16</b> is formed. Here, wirings <b>29</b><i>a </i>and <b>29</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) are formed along with the gate electrode <b>16</b>, too. Note that the processing may be performed by etching the conductive layer by using a resist mask.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Next, an impurity at high concentration is introduced to the semiconductor layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>by using the gate electrode <b>16</b> as a mask. Hereby, a transistor <b>17</b> including the semiconductor layer <b>14</b><i>a</i>, the gate insulating layer <b>15</b> and the gate electrode <b>16</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In addition, manufacturing steps of the transistor <b>17</b> may be suitably changed so that a transistor of a desired structure can be manufactured without particular limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Next, an insulating layer <b>18</b> covering the gate electrode <b>16</b>, the wirings <b>29</b><i>a </i>and <b>29</b><i>b</i>, the gate insulating layer <b>15</b> and the like is formed. In this embodiment, the insulating layer <b>18</b> is formed by using an inorganic material having self-planarity such as siloxane. Note that the insulating layer <b>18</b> may be also formed by using an organic material having self-planarity without being limited to the above. In addition, the insulating layer <b>18</b> does not necessary include a substance having self-planarity, and it may only include the substance which does not have self-planarity. Further, the insulating layer <b>18</b> may be a layer of the multilayer structure in which a layer including the substance having self-planarity and a layer including the substance which dose not have self-planarity are laminated. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Next, a contact hole penetrating the insulating layer <b>18</b> to reach the semiconductor layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>and a first opening reaching the semiconductor layer <b>14</b><i>b </i>are formed. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Next, after forming a conductive layer <b>19</b> covering the insulating layer <b>18</b> and the like (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>), the conductive layer <b>19</b> is processed in a desired shape to form a connecting portion <b>19</b><i>a</i>, wirings <b>19</b><i>b </i>and <b>19</b><i>c</i>, a film <b>19</b><i>d </i>and the like. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>) At this time, in the first opening, the semiconductor layer <b>14</b><i>b </i>and the insulating layer <b>12</b><i>b </i>are partially removed by etching so that the insulating layer <b>12</b><i>a </i>is exposed. In this embodiment, the semiconductor layer <b>14</b><i>b </i>is used as a layer to regulate etching rate. Thus, it is not necessary to provide the semiconductor layer <b>14</b><i>b </i>particularly like a light emitting device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as long as etching rate can be regulated without the semiconductor layer <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p>

In addition, when a depression or a projection is formed on the insulating layer <b>12</b><i>a</i>, the depression or the projection can be relieved by providing a layer containing a high molecular weight material such as PEDOT in a part of the light emitting layer <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Then, a second electrode <b>23</b> covering the light emitting layer <b>22</b> is formed.
