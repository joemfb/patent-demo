<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/483,445, filed Jul. 10, 2006 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,330,712, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/698,602 filed Oct. 31, 2003, which has issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,076,239, issued Jul. 11, 2006. This application also claims the benefit, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(e), of provisional U.S. patent application No. 60/424,723, filed Nov. 8, 2002, entitled &#x201c;SYSTEM AND METHOD OF CONNECTION CONTROL FOR WIRELESS MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES.&#x201d; By this reference, each of the above applications is hereby incorporated herein for all purposes.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application relates generally to wireless mobile communication devices, and in particular to providing control of communication connections for such devices.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many known wireless mobile communication devices (&#x201c;mobile devices&#x201d;) support different types of communication network connections and data exchange with different information sources or destination systems. For example, modern mobile telephones are often enabled for both data and voice communications and typically exchange both public and private information with remote communication equipment, including web servers on the Internet and data servers associated with a user's employer, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Private information such as data obtained from a corporate data server in a private network is normally protected during transfer to a mobile device via secure connections, encryption, digital signatures, or some combination thereof, thereby effectively extending information security measures implemented at the corporate data server to the mobile device. However, an owner or source of the private information may wish to prevent transfer of the information outside the mobile device. On known mobile devices which also support communication with other entities external to the corporate data server and private network, it is possible for a software application to open a connection or communication &#x201c;pipe&#x201d; with both the corporate data server and an external entity and then funnel private information from the corporate data server to the external entity. Such a &#x201c;split-pipe&#x201d; attack could potentially be mounted by a software application downloaded by a mobile device user or a virus, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there remains a need for a system and method of connection control for mobile devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with the teachings disclosed herein, a system of connection control for a wireless mobile communication device is provided for communication via a plurality of communication connections and operable to execute a software application comprises a memory configured to store connection control information associating the software application with a communication connection, and a connection controller. The connection controller is configured to receive a connection request from the software application specifying a requested connection and to access the memory to determine whether the requested connection is permitted by the connection control information. Where the requested connection is permitted by the connection control information, the requested connection is opened.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other aspects may be included, such as the connection controller being configured to determine whether the requested connection is a first connection opened by the software application, and if so, to associate the software application with the requested connection in the connection control information in the memory.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A method of connection control according comprises the steps of providing connection control information associating a software application with a communication connection, receiving a connection request from the software application specifying a requested connection, determining whether the requested connection is permitted by the connection control information, opening the requested connection where the requested connection is permitted by the connection control information.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other aspects may be includes such as determining whether the requested connection is a first connection opened by the software application, and if so, updating the connection control information to associate the software application with the requested connection.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">These methods are not limited to the order of steps or segregation of steps described above; rather, the aggregation of steps, or portions thereof, into a single step, or multiple other steps, or the reordering of such original steps or aggregations are specifically contemplated. In addition, one or more of the described steps may be stored as computer executable instructions in and/or on any suitable combination of computer-readable media. Instead of, or in addition to stored instructions, one or more steps, or portions thereof, may be executed by special purpose hardware designed to perform such steps.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further features of connection control systems and methods will be described or will become apparent in the course of the following detailed description.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing a communication system in which wireless mobile communication devices may be used. The communication system <b>10</b> includes a Wide Area Network (WAN) <b>12</b>, coupled to a computer system <b>14</b>, a wireless network gateway <b>16</b> and a corporate Local Area Network (LAN) <b>18</b>. The wireless network gateway <b>16</b> is also connected to a wireless communication network <b>20</b> in which a mobile device <b>22</b> configured to operate.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The computer system <b>14</b> may be a desktop or laptop PC, which is configured to communicate to the WAN <b>12</b>, the Internet for example. PCs, such as computer system <b>14</b>, normally access the Internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP), Application Service Provider (ASP) or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The corporate LAN <b>18</b> is an example of a typical working environment, in which multiple computers <b>28</b> are connected in a network. Such a network is often located behind a security firewall <b>24</b>. Within the corporate LAN <b>18</b>, a data server <b>26</b>, operating on a computer behind the firewall <b>24</b>, acts as the primary interface for the corporation to exchange data both within the LAN <b>18</b>, and with other external systems and devices via the WAN <b>12</b>. The data server <b>26</b> may, for example, be a messaging server such as a Microsoft&#x2122; Exchange Server or a Lotus Domino&#x2122; server. These servers also provide additional functionality, such as dynamic database storage for data like calendars, todo lists, task lists, e-mail and documentation. Although only a data server <b>26</b> is shown in the LAN <b>18</b>, those skilled in the art will appreciate that a LAN may include more than one server, including other types of servers supporting resources that are shared between the networked computer systems <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The data server <b>26</b> provides data communication capabilities to networked computer systems <b>28</b> coupled to the LAN <b>18</b>. A typical LAN <b>18</b> includes multiple computer systems <b>28</b>, each of which implements an appropriate client for communications with the data server <b>26</b>. In the above example of electronic messaging, within the LAN <b>18</b>, messages are received by the data server <b>26</b>, distributed to the appropriate mailboxes for user accounts addressed in the received message, and are then accessed by a user through a messaging client operating on a computer system <b>28</b>. Exchange of other types of data than electronic messages is similarly enabled using clients compatible with the data server <b>26</b>. Multiple-purpose clients such as Lotus Notes, for example, handle electronic messages as well as other types of files and data.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The wireless gateway <b>16</b> provides an interface to a wireless network <b>20</b>, through which data may be exchanged with a mobile device <b>22</b>. The mobile device <b>22</b> may, for example, be a data communication device, a dual-mode communication device such as many modern cellular telephones having both data and voice communications functionality, a multiple-mode device capable of voice, data and other types of communications, a personal digital assistant (PDA) enabled for wireless communications, or a laptop or desktop computer system with a wireless modem. An exemplary mobile device is described in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Such functions as addressing of the mobile device <b>22</b>, encoding or otherwise transforming messages for wireless transmission, or other necessary interface functions are performed by the wireless network gateway <b>16</b>. The wireless network gateway <b>16</b> may be configured to operate with more than one wireless network <b>20</b>, in which case the wireless gateway <b>16</b> also determines a most likely network for locating a given mobile device <b>22</b> and possibly tracks mobile devices as users roam between countries or networks. Although only a single wireless network gateway <b>16</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the mobile device <b>22</b> could be configured to communicate with more than one gateway, such as a corporate network gateway and a WAP gateway, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Any computer system with access to the WAN <b>12</b> may potentially exchange data with the mobile device <b>22</b> through the wireless network gateway <b>16</b>, provided the mobile device is enabled for such communications. Alternatively, private wireless network gateways such as wireless Virtual Private Network (VPN) routers could also be implemented to provide a private interface to a wireless network. For example, a wireless VPN implemented in the LAN <b>18</b> may provide a private interface from the LAN <b>18</b> to one or more mobile devices such as <b>22</b> through the wireless network <b>20</b> without requiring the wireless network gateway <b>16</b>. Such a private interface to a mobile device <b>22</b> via the wireless network gateway <b>16</b> and/or the wireless network <b>20</b> may also effectively be extended to entities outside the LAN <b>18</b> by providing a data forwarding or redirection system that operates in conjunction with the data server <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A wireless network <b>20</b> normally delivers data to and from communication devices such as the mobile device <b>22</b> via radio frequency (RF) transmissions between base stations and devices. The wireless network <b>20</b> may, for example, be a data-centric wireless network, a voice-centric wireless network, or a dual-mode network that can support both voice and data communications over the same infrastructure. Recently developed networks include Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) networks, Groupe Special Mobile or the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) networks, and third-generation (3G) networks like Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution (EDGE) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems (UMTS), which are currently under development. GPRS is a data overlay on top of the existing GSM wireless network, which is used operating in virtually every country in Europe. Some older examples of data-centric networks include, but are not limited to, the Mobitex&#x2122; Radio Network (&#x201c;Mobitex&#x201d;), and the DataTAC&#x2122; Radio Network (&#x201c;DataTAC&#x201d;). Examples of known voice-centric data networks include Personal Communication Systems (PCS) networks like GSM and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems that have been available in North America and world-wide for several years.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the system <b>10</b>, a company which owns the corporate LAN <b>18</b> may provide both a computer system <b>28</b> and a mobile device <b>22</b> to an employee. Corporate data on the LAN <b>18</b> is then accessible to the user through at least the computer system <b>28</b>. Many corporate mobile device owners also provide access to corporate data via mobile devices such as <b>22</b>. Even though mobile devices provided to employee users by employer owners may be intended primarily for business purposes, other accepted or allowed mobile device functions and services, both business-related and personal, often involve communication network connections to systems outside a corporate network <b>18</b> or security firewall <b>24</b>. As described above, secure connections, data encryption, and other secure communications techniques effectively extend the security firewall <b>24</b> to the mobile device <b>22</b> when corporate data is being accessed using the mobile device <b>22</b>. However, software applications on the mobile device <b>22</b> can potentially open connections on both sides of the firewall <b>24</b>, including a connection <b>27</b> back into the corporate LAN <b>18</b>, and a connection <b>29</b> to an external entity, the computer system <b>14</b>, outside the firewall <b>24</b>. In this manner, corporate data accessible through the data server <b>26</b> can be funneled from the corporate network <b>18</b> to the external computer system <b>14</b>. In this instance, the computer system <b>14</b> obtains corporate data but is not linked with the data access operation via an audit trail. The only audit trail associated with such a data access operation would indicate that the corporate data was accessed by the authorized mobile device <b>22</b>, not by the computer system <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A corporate owner of the mobile device <b>22</b> could address this problem by installing any allowable software applications on the mobile device <b>22</b> before the mobile device <b>22</b> is provided to an employee user, and configuring the mobile device <b>22</b> to prevent installation of any further software applications. Although this scheme protects against split-pipe attacks on corporate data, it also requires the corporate owner to perform mobile device software updates and installation of new software applications, for example, for all mobile devices owned by the corporate owner, which could include hundreds or thousands of mobile devices in a large company. Therefore, such a security measure may be effective, but creates further problem of mobile device software management.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Systems and methods as proposed herein also prevent split-pipe attacks, while allowing users to manage mobile device software.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of a wireless mobile communication device in which a system and method of connection control is implemented. It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that only the components involved in a connection control system are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. A mobile device typically includes further components, depending upon the type and functionality of the mobile device, than those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The mobile device <b>30</b> comprises a memory <b>32</b>, a connection controller <b>40</b>, a wireless transceiver <b>48</b>, a user interface (UI) <b>46</b>, and an interface or connector <b>50</b>. The memory <b>32</b> includes a software applications store <b>34</b>, a connection policy store <b>36</b>, and an application data store <b>38</b>. The connection policy store <b>36</b> is configured or adapted to enable connection control for the mobile device <b>30</b>. The software application store <b>34</b> and the application data store <b>38</b> are illustrative of other types of information stores that may be provided in the memory <b>32</b>. Further information stores, such as a contacts list, a message store, a file system, and a key store, for example, may also be provided in the memory <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The memory <b>32</b> is, or at least includes, a writeable store such as a RAM into which other device components may write data. The software applications store <b>34</b> includes software applications that have been installed on the mobile device <b>30</b>, and may include, for example, an electronic messaging software application, a personal information management (PIM) software application, games, as well as other software applications. In the connection policy store <b>36</b>, connection control information, which specifies which types of connections or communication &#x201c;pipes&#x201d; that each software application is permitted to establish, is stored. Data associated with the software applications installed on the mobile device <b>30</b> is stored in the application data store <b>38</b>, and may include, for example, data files used by a software application or configuration information for a software application.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The wireless transceiver <b>48</b> enables the mobile device <b>30</b> for communications via a wireless network. The mobile device <b>30</b> is also enabled for communications with a similarly-equipped PC or other device, including another mobile device, via the interface/connector <b>50</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, connection controller <b>40</b> is coupled to the memory <b>32</b>, the wireless transceiver <b>48</b>, the UI <b>46</b>, and the interface/connector <b>50</b>. As will be described in further detail below, access to the wireless transceiver, and possibly the interface/connector <b>50</b>, is controlled by the connection controller <b>40</b>. The connection controller <b>40</b> can be implemented as a software module or operating system that is executed by a mobile device processor (not shown). For example, where the mobile device <b>30</b> is a Java&#x2122;-enabled device including a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as its operating system, functionality of the connection controller <b>40</b> may be incorporated within the JVM or implemented as a software component that is executed by the JVM. Connection control at the operating system level provides more streamlined and reliable connection control than control implemented at a software application level.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The UI <b>46</b> may include such UI components as a keyboard or keypad, a display, or other components which may accept inputs from or provide outputs to a user of the mobile device <b>30</b>. Although shown as a single block in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it should be apparent that a mobile device <b>30</b> typically includes more than one UI, and the UI <b>46</b> is therefore intended to represent one or more user interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The interface/connector <b>50</b> enables information transfer between the mobile device <b>30</b> and a PC or another device via a communication link established between the interface/connector <b>50</b> and a compatible interface or connector in the PC or other device. The interface/connector <b>50</b> could be any of a plurality of data transfer components, including, for example, an optical data transfer interface such as an Infrared Data Association (IrDA) port, some other short-range wireless communications interface, or a wired interface such as serial, parallel, PCMCIA, PCI or Universal Serial Bus (USB) port and connection. Known short-range wireless communications interfaces include, for example, &#x201c;Bluetooth&#x201d; modules and 802.11 modules according to the Bluetooth and 802.11 specifications, respectively. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that Bluetooth and 802.11 denote sets of specifications, available from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), relating to wireless LANs and wireless personal area networks, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Since communications between the mobile device <b>30</b> and other systems or devices via the interface/connector <b>50</b> need not necessarily be via a physical connection, references to connecting a mobile device to a PC or other device or system includes establishing communications through either physical connections or wireless transfer schemes. Thus, the mobile device <b>30</b> could be connected to a PC, for example, by placing the mobile device <b>30</b> in a mobile device cradle connected to a serial port on the PC, by positioning the mobile device <b>30</b> such that an optical port thereof is in a line of sight of a similar port of the PC, or by physically connecting or arranging the mobile device <b>30</b> and PC in some other manner so that data may be exchanged. The particular operations involved in establishing communications between a mobile device and another system or device will be dependent upon the types of interfaces and/or connectors available in both the mobile device and the other system or device.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As described above, split-pipe attacks are possible when both internal and external connections, that is, connections terminated within and outside a private network or security firewall, can be opened by a mobile device software application. In the mobile device <b>30</b>, connections can be made via the wireless transceiver <b>48</b> or the interface/connector <b>50</b>. Depending upon the type of mobile device <b>30</b> and the possible uses of the interface/connector <b>50</b>, split-pipe attacks may be possible using different pipes associated with the wireless transceiver <b>48</b>. Where private information may be transferred to the mobile device <b>30</b> via the interface/connector <b>50</b> when the mobile device <b>30</b> is connected to a similarly enabled system or device, for example, the private information could be funneled to an external entity by a software application which opens connections via the interface/connection <b>50</b> and the wireless transceiver <b>48</b>. In this case, the connection controller <b>40</b> preferably controls access to both the wireless transceiver <b>48</b> and the interface/connector <b>50</b>. However, it is noted that a mobile device implementing a connection control system or method in this manner need not necessarily incorporate such an interface/connector <b>50</b>. Connection control could be implemented for connections using the same communication medium, such as multiple pipes established through the wireless transceiver <b>48</b>, or connections using different communication media, where such different media are available.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A communication pipe is a connection, or means of communication, between a mobile device and some external entity. A particular physical transport layer, such as Universal Serial Bus (USB), Bluetooth, a serial port, a parallel port, 802.11 and GPRS, can represent several logical communication pipes, depending on the gateway at the other end. For example, the wireless transceiver <b>48</b> might be used to communicate with both a WAP gateway and a corporate gateway through a wireless communication network. In this case, connections with the WAP gateway and the corporate gateway may be established through the same physical transport in the wireless network, but represent separate communication pipes.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A software application may be associated with a connection or communication pipe the first time a connection is opened by the software application. An entry in the connection policy store <b>36</b> is either created or updated by the connection controller <b>40</b> for a software application when a connection is first opened by the software application. Once a software application is associated with a connection in the connection policy store <b>36</b>, the software application cannot establish any other type of connection. The connection policy store <b>36</b> is preferably in a protected memory location not accessible to software applications on the mobile device <b>30</b>. This ensures that a software application cannot open an internal connection to a source of private information, retrieve private information from the source, and then erase or change the connection policy store <b>36</b> in order to circumvent connection control.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Connection control information for a software application may be created in the connection policy store <b>36</b> either before or after the software application first establishes a connection. A connection control information entry containing default or null control information, indicating no connection type restriction or that any available type of connection can be opened, may be created for a software application when the software application is installed on the mobile device <b>30</b>. The latter type of entry is shown in the connection policy store <b>36</b> for application C. When the software application C attempts to open a connection via pipe B, for example, the connection controller <b>40</b> consults the connection policy store <b>36</b>, determines that the software application C may open a connection via either pipe A or pipe B, and the connection is opened. The connection controller then updates the connection policy store <b>36</b> to indicate that the software application C is restricted to pipe B, and the updated entry would appear similar to the entry shown for application B.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Alternatively, a connection control information entry for a software application could be created after the software application opens a connection for the first time. In this example, when a software application attempts to open a connection, the connection controller <b>40</b> consults the connection policy store <b>36</b> and determines that no connection control information entry exists for the software application. The connection is then opened for the software application, and the connection controller <b>40</b> creates a connection control information entry in the connection policy store <b>36</b> for the software application, indicating that the software application is permitted to open only the type of connection that was first opened by that application.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">When a software application subsequently attempts to open a connection, the connection controller <b>40</b> accesses the connection policy store <b>36</b> and determines the type of connection that the software application is permitted to open. If the attempted connection is not of the permitted type, then the connection is denied.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As will be apparent from the foregoing, software applications cannot directly initiate connections. Each request by a software application to open a connection is processed by the connection controller <b>40</b> to determine whether the connection is allowed for that software application. Where the connection is allowed, the connection controller either opens the connection or directs other components of the mobile device <b>30</b>, such as the wireless transceiver <b>48</b>, to open the connection. Alternatively, software applications can only directly initiate connections after receiving suitable approval from connection controller <b>40</b>; software applications upon receipt of approval can then make direct requests for connections that include an indicator of the prior approval.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a further embodiment of a connection control system on a wireless mobile communication device. The mobile device <b>31</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes a memory <b>33</b>, a processor <b>41</b>, an application loader <b>42</b>, an insertion module <b>44</b>, a user interface (UI) <b>46</b>, a wireless transceiver <b>48</b>, and an interface/connector <b>50</b>. The memory <b>33</b> includes a software applications store <b>34</b>, a connection policy store <b>36</b>, and an authorization record store <b>37</b>, and may also include further data stores associated with other device systems in addition to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The mobile device <b>31</b> is substantially the same as the mobile device <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The software applications store <b>34</b>, connection policy store <b>36</b>, the UI <b>46</b>, the wireless transceiver <b>48</b>, and the interface/connector <b>50</b> have been described above. The memory <b>33</b> is also similar to the memory <b>32</b>, but includes the authorization record store <b>37</b> which stores records that specify usage permissions and restrictions for the mobile device <b>31</b>, software applications on the mobile device <b>31</b>, or both. Connection control for the mobile device <b>31</b> is provided by the processor <b>41</b>, in conjunction with both the connection policy store <b>36</b>, substantially as described above, and the authorization record store, as described in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The processor <b>41</b> is connected to the wireless transceiver <b>48</b> and thus enables the mobile device <b>31</b> for communications via a wireless network. The application loader <b>42</b> and insertion module <b>44</b> are connected to the interface/connector <b>50</b> to allow communication with a similarly enabled PC or other device to load applications and authorization records onto the mobile device <b>31</b>. It should be appreciated that software applications and authorization records could also be loaded through the wireless transceiver <b>48</b> and a wireless communication network. However, connections from the wireless transceiver <b>48</b> to the application loader <b>42</b> and the insertion tool <b>44</b> have not been shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to avoid congestion in the drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Authorization records provide a further level of connection control for an owner of the mobile device <b>31</b>, such as an employer of a mobile device user. When the connection policy store <b>36</b> is provided on a mobile device, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, authorization records in the authorization record store <b>37</b> may specify, for example, the types of connections that may be opened by the mobile device <b>31</b>, which pipes are restricted for use by only those applications installed or provided by the owner, or which pipes can be used by other software applications. Although authorization records established by an owner may control other functions of the mobile device <b>31</b> than data communication connections, records relating to connection control are most pertinent to the systems and methods described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">An owner of the mobile device <b>31</b> preferably inserts authorization records onto the mobile device <b>31</b> using the insertion module <b>44</b> before communication functions of the mobile device <b>31</b> are operable by a user. This may be accomplished, for example, by pre-loading authorization records into the authorization record store <b>37</b> from a configuration device such as a PC before the mobile device <b>31</b> is provided to the user by the owner, or before the mobile device <b>31</b> is configured for use. In the former example, the owner maintains physical control of the mobile device <b>31</b> until authorization records have been loaded, whereas in the latter example, the user has possession of the mobile device <b>31</b> but is unable to make use of the device until it is configured by, or at least under the control of, the owner.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Pre-loading of authorization records onto the mobile device <b>31</b> is performed using the insertion module <b>44</b>, the interface/connector <b>50</b>, and a similarly enabled configuration device. When the mobile device <b>31</b> has been connected to the configuration device, authorization records are transferred to the mobile device <b>31</b> through the interface/connector <b>50</b>, and passed to the insertion module <b>44</b> on the mobile device <b>31</b>, which stores the authorization records to the authorization record store <b>37</b> in the memory <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Although the insertion module <b>44</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as being connected to the interface/connector <b>50</b>, this module could be implemented as a software module or application that is executed by the processor <b>41</b>. As such, data transfers to and from the interface/connector <b>50</b> may actually be accomplished by routing data through the processor <b>41</b>. In this case, the processor <b>41</b> may be instructed by the configuration device to start the insertion module <b>44</b> before the authorization records are transferred to the mobile device <b>31</b>. Alternatively, the processor <b>41</b> may be configured to start the insertion module <b>44</b> whenever authorization records are received or connection of the mobile device <b>31</b> to a configuration device is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, other systems on the mobile device <b>30</b> have access to the memory <b>33</b>. However, no device system other than the insertion module <b>44</b> should be able to insert, change, or erase information stored in the authorization record store <b>37</b>. The authorization data store <b>37</b>, like the connection policy store <b>36</b> as described above, is therefore preferably located in a protected memory area that is not accessible to other device systems or software applications. Only the insertion module <b>44</b> has write and erase access to the authorization record store <b>37</b>. Other device systems have read only access to authorization records.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Access control to the authorization record store <b>37</b> could be enforced, for example, using digital signature techniques. Pre-loading a public signature key, corresponding to a private signature key of the mobile device owner, onto the mobile device <b>31</b> enables digital signature-based control of insertion and erasure of authorization records. When the owner's public signature key has been inserted into the mobile device <b>31</b>, through the interface/connector <b>50</b> or the wireless transceiver <b>48</b>, and stored in a key store (not shown) on the mobile device <b>31</b>, the insertion module <b>44</b> can verify a digital signature on any subsequently inserted authorization records or memory write or erase commands before the authorization records are stored in the authorization record store <b>37</b> or the commands are executed. If digital signature verification fails, then the authorization records are not stored on the mobile device <b>31</b>, and the commands are not executed. Digital signature-based access control also allows distribution of authorization records over insecure connections. A connection through the interface/connector <b>50</b>, such as through a serial connection to a user's office PC, can normally be trusted since the source of information is trusted and the connection is secure; however, such connection can be secured as discussed herein. Using digital signatures and verification, a mobile device <b>31</b> can verify the integrity and origin of authorization records received via other connections, including wireless communication pipes.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one embodiment, any systems or components through which the memory <b>33</b> is accessible are configured to allow memory read operations from any locations in the memory <b>33</b>, but deny any write or erase operations to the authorization record store <b>37</b> unless the operations originate with or are authorized by the insertion module <b>44</b>. In an alternative implementation, a memory manager (not shown) is provided to manage all memory access operations. Such a memory manager is configured to direct any write or erase operations involving the authorization record store to the insertion module <b>44</b> for digital signature verification before completing the operations.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Software application loading operations are enabled on the mobile device <b>31</b> by the application loader <b>42</b>. As described above in regard to the insertion module <b>44</b>, although the application loader <b>42</b> is shown as being connected to the interface/connector <b>50</b>, information may actually be exchanged between the application loader <b>42</b> and the interface/connector <b>50</b>, or the wireless transceiver <b>48</b>, through the processor <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Software applications may be received by the mobile device <b>31</b> via the interface/connector <b>50</b> or the wireless transceiver <b>48</b>. One possible source of software applications configured for operation on the mobile device <b>31</b> is a user's computer system equipped with an interface/connector compatible with the interface/connector <b>50</b>. When the computer system is connected to a corporate LAN, for example, software applications provided by a corporate owner of the mobile device <b>31</b> may be retrieved from a file server on the LAN or other store on the LAN, and transferred to the mobile device <b>31</b>. A computer system or mobile device <b>31</b> may also obtain software applications from other sources, such as Internet-based sources, with which the computer system or mobile device <b>31</b> communicates.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The application loader <b>42</b> is configured to install software applications on the mobile device <b>31</b>, but may also perform such operations as checking a digital signature on a received software application or determining whether a received software application is approved for installation on the mobile device <b>31</b> before a software application is installed. Software application installation typically involves such operations as storing a received application file to the software applications store <b>34</b> in the memory <b>32</b>, extracting files for storage to the software applications store <b>34</b>, or possibly executing an installation program or utility.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, as above, a software application is associated with a connection or communication pipe the first time a connection is opened by the software application by creating or updating an entry in the connection policy store <b>36</b>. The connection controller <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is embodied in the processor <b>41</b> in the mobile device <b>31</b>. The processor <b>41</b> executes connection control software, at an application level or an operating system level, to prevent split-pipe attacks substantially as described above. When a request from a software application to open a connection is received by the processor <b>41</b>, the connection policy store <b>36</b> is accessed to determine if the requested connection is allowed for that software application. Where the requested connection is not allowed, the connection is denied.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As a further connection control measure, when connection control information in the connection policy store <b>26</b> allows the requested connection, the processor <b>41</b> also accesses the authorization record store <b>37</b> to determine whether the connection is permitted. Authorization records may specify further connection restrictions, to allow or deny particular connections or types of connections, for example, for all software applications or for certain software applications. In this embodiment, even though a software application may be associated with one or more connections in the connection policy store <b>36</b>, the processor <b>41</b> denies the requested connection where an authorization record specifies that the requested connection is not authorized. This situation may arise, for instance, where authorization records are inserted onto the mobile device <b>31</b> after a software application has first opened a connection.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Where a requested connection is allowed by both the connection control information in the connection policy store <b>36</b> for the software application and authorization records in the authorization record store <b>37</b> for the connection and/or the software application, the connection is opened by the processor <b>41</b>. Otherwise, the connection is denied.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the connection policy store <b>36</b> and the authorization record store <b>37</b> could alternatively be accessed in reverse order.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow diagram showing a method for connection control for a wireless mobile communication device. The method begins at step <b>70</b>, where a request to perform an operation, in this case to open a connection, is received from a software application. At step <b>72</b>, the connection controller <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) or the processor <b>41</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) determines the communication resource to which the request relates. For a connection control scheme, the communication resource is a connection or pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">It is then determined at step <b>74</b> whether the requested connection operation is permitted. This determination involves accessing a connection policy store, and possibly an authorization record store, to determine whether the requested connection is allowed for the software application from which the request was received. The operation is completed by opening or authorizing the requested connection at step <b>76</b> where the requested connection is permitted. If the requested connection is the first connection opened by the software application, then step <b>76</b> involves the further operation of creating or updating connection control information in the connection policy store.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The requested connection is denied at step <b>78</b> where it is not permitted. A requested connection could be denied based on connection control information or authorization records. Error processing, such as requesting a different connection, may then be performed by the requesting software application at step <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram of an example wireless mobile communication device. The mobile device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is representative of a type of mobile device in which connection control systems and methods described herein could be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The mobile device <b>500</b> is preferably a two-way communication device enabled for at least voice and data communications, with the further capability to communicate with other computer systems on the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile device, the mobile device may be referred to as a data messaging device, a two-way pager, a cellular telephone with data messaging capabilities, a wireless Internet appliance, or a data communication device (with or without telephony capabilities). As mentioned above, such devices are referred to generally herein simply as mobile devices.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The mobile device <b>500</b> includes a transceiver <b>511</b>, a microprocessor <b>538</b>, a display <b>522</b>, non-volatile memory <b>524</b>, random access memory (RAM) <b>526</b>, auxiliary input/output (I/O) devices <b>528</b>, a serial port <b>530</b>, a keyboard <b>532</b>, a speaker <b>534</b>, a microphone <b>536</b>, a short-range wireless communications sub-system <b>540</b>, and may also include other device sub-systems <b>542</b>. The transceiver <b>511</b> preferably includes transmit and receive antennas <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, a receiver (Rx) <b>512</b>, a transmitter (Tx) <b>514</b>, one or more local oscillators (LOs) <b>513</b>, and a digital signal processor (DSP) <b>520</b>. Within the non-volatile memory <b>524</b>, the mobile device <b>500</b> includes a plurality of software modules <b>524</b>A-<b>524</b>N that can be executed by the microprocessor <b>538</b> (and/or the DSP <b>520</b>), including a voice communication module <b>524</b>A, a data communication module <b>524</b>B, and a plurality of other operational modules <b>524</b>N for carrying out a plurality of other functions.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The mobile device <b>500</b> is preferably a two-way communication device having voice and data communication capabilities. Thus, for example, the mobile device <b>500</b> may communicate over a voice network, such as any of the analog or digital cellular networks, and may also communicate over a data network. The voice and data networks are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> by the communication tower <b>519</b>. These voice and data networks may be separate communication networks using separate infrastructure, such as base stations, network controllers, etc., or they may be integrated into a single wireless network. References to the network <b>519</b> should therefore be interpreted as encompassing both a single voice and data network and separate networks.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The communication subsystem <b>511</b> is used to communicate with the network <b>519</b>. The DSP <b>520</b> is used to send and receive communication signals to and from the transmitter <b>514</b> and receiver <b>512</b>, and also exchange control information with the transmitter <b>514</b> and receiver <b>512</b>. If the voice and data communications occur at a single frequency, or closely-spaced set of frequencies, then a single LO <b>513</b> may be used in conjunction with the transmitter <b>514</b> and receiver <b>512</b>. Alternatively, if different frequencies are utilized for voice communications versus data communications or the mobile device <b>500</b> is enabled for communications on more than one network <b>519</b>, then a plurality of LOs <b>513</b> can be used to generate frequencies corresponding to those used in the network <b>519</b>. Although two antennas <b>516</b>, <b>518</b> are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the mobile device <b>500</b> could be used with a single antenna structure. Information, which includes both voice and data information, is communicated to and from the communication module <b>511</b> via a link between the DSP <b>520</b> and the microprocessor <b>538</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The detailed design of the communication subsystem <b>511</b>, such as frequency band, component selection, power level, etc., is dependent upon the communication network <b>519</b> in which the mobile device <b>500</b> is intended to operate. For example, a mobile device <b>500</b> intended to operate in a North American market may include a communication subsystem <b>511</b> designed to operate with the Mobitex or DataTAC mobile data communication networks and also designed to operate with any of a variety of voice communication networks, such as AMPS, TDMA, CDMA, PCS, etc., whereas a mobile device <b>500</b> intended for use in Europe may be configured to operate with the GPRS data communication network and the GSM voice communication network. Other types of data and voice networks, both separate and integrated, may also be utilized with the mobile device <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Communication network access requirements for the mobile device <b>500</b> also vary depending upon the type of network <b>519</b>. For example, in the Mobitex and DataTAC data networks, mobile devices are registered on the network using a unique identification number associated with each device. In GPRS data networks, however, network access is associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile device <b>500</b>. A GPRS device typically requires a subscriber identity module (&#x201c;SIM&#x201d;), which is required in order to operate the mobile device <b>500</b> on a GPRS network. Local or non-network communication functions (if any) may be operable, without the SIM, but the mobile device <b>500</b> is unable to carry out functions involving communications over the network <b>519</b>, other than any legally required operations, such as &#x2018;911&#x2019; emergency calling.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">After any required network registration or activation procedures have been completed, the mobile device <b>500</b> is able to send and receive communication signals, preferably including both voice and data signals, over the network <b>519</b>. Signals received by the antenna <b>516</b> from the communication network <b>519</b> are routed to the receiver <b>512</b>, which provides for signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., and may also provide analog to digital conversion. Analog to digital conversion of the received signal allows more complex communication functions, such as digital demodulation and decoding, to be performed using the DSP <b>520</b>. In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted to the network <b>519</b> are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP <b>520</b> and are then provided to the transmitter <b>514</b> for digital to analog conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification and transmission to the communication network <b>519</b> via the antenna <b>518</b>. Although a single transceiver <b>511</b> is shown for both voice and data communications, in alternative embodiments, the mobile device <b>500</b> may include multiple distinct transceivers, such as a first transceiver for transmitting and receiving voice signals, and a second transceiver for transmitting and receiving data signals, or a first transceiver configured to operate within a first frequency band, and a second transceiver configured to operate within a second frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In addition to processing the communication signals, the DSP <b>520</b> also provides for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gain levels applied to communication signals in the receiver <b>512</b> and transmitter <b>514</b> may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP <b>520</b>. Other transceiver control algorithms could also be implemented in the DSP <b>520</b> in order to provide more sophisticated control of the transceiver <b>511</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The microprocessor <b>538</b> preferably manages and controls the overall operation of the mobile device <b>500</b>. Many types of microprocessors or microcontrollers could be used here, or, alternatively, a single DSP <b>520</b> could be used to carry out the functions of the microprocessor <b>538</b>. Low-level communication functions, including at least data and voice communications, are performed through the DSP <b>520</b> in the transceiver <b>511</b>. High-level communication applications, including the voice communication application <b>524</b>A, and the data communication application <b>524</b>B are stored in the non-volatile memory <b>524</b> for execution by the microprocessor <b>538</b>. For example, the voice communication module <b>524</b>A may provide a high-level user interface operable to transmit and receive voice calls between the mobile device <b>500</b> and a plurality of other voice devices via the network <b>519</b>. Similarly, the data communication module <b>524</b>B may provide a high-level user interface operable for sending and receiving data, such as e-mail messages, files, organizer information, short text messages, etc., between the mobile device <b>500</b> and a plurality of other data devices via the network <b>519</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The microprocessor <b>538</b> also interacts with other device subsystems, such as the display <b>522</b>, RAM <b>526</b>, auxiliary I/O devices <b>528</b>, serial port <b>530</b>, keyboard <b>532</b>, speaker <b>534</b>, microphone <b>536</b>, a short-range communications subsystem <b>540</b> and any other device subsystems generally designated as <b>542</b>. For example, the modules <b>524</b>A-N are executed by the microprocessor <b>538</b> and may provide a high-level interface between a user of the mobile device and the mobile device. This interface typically includes a graphical component provided through the display <b>522</b>, and an input/output component provided through the auxiliary I/O devices <b>528</b>, keyboard <b>532</b>, speaker <b>534</b>, or microphone <b>536</b>. Such interfaces are designated generally as UI <b>46</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Some of the subsystems shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide &#x201c;resident&#x201d; or on-device functions. Notably, some subsystems, such as keyboard <b>532</b> and display <b>522</b> may be used for both communication-related functions, such as entering a text message for transmission over a data communication network, and device-resident functions such as a calculator or task list or other PDA type functions.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Operating system software used by the microprocessor <b>538</b> is preferably stored in a persistent store such as the non-volatile memory <b>524</b>. In addition to the operating system and communication modules <b>524</b>A-N, the non-volatile memory <b>524</b> may include a file system for storing data. The non-volatile memory <b>524</b> may also include data stores for connection control information, and possibly authorization records. The operating system, specific device applications or modules, or parts thereof, may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store, such as RAM <b>526</b> for faster operation. Moreover, received communication signals may also be temporarily stored to RAM <b>526</b>, before permanently writing them to a file system located in the non-volatile memory <b>524</b>. The non-volatile memory <b>524</b> may be implemented, for example, with Flash memory, non-volatile RAM, or battery backed-up RAM.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">An exemplary application module <b>524</b>N that may be loaded onto the mobile device <b>500</b> is a PIM application providing PDA functionality, such as calendar events, appointments, and task items. This module <b>524</b>N may also interact with the voice communication module <b>524</b>A for managing phone calls, voice mails, etc., and may also interact with the data communication module <b>524</b>B for managing e-mail communications and other data transmissions. Alternatively, all of the functionality of the voice communication module <b>524</b>A and the data communication module <b>524</b>B may be integrated into the PIM module.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The non-volatile memory <b>524</b> preferably provides a file system to facilitate storage of PIM data items on the device. The PIM application preferably includes the ability to send and receive data items, either by itself, or in conjunction with the voice and data communication modules <b>524</b>A, <b>524</b>B, via the wireless network <b>519</b>. The PIM data items are preferably seamlessly integrated, synchronized and updated, via the wireless network <b>519</b>, with a corresponding set of data items stored or associated with a host computer system, thereby creating a mirrored system for data items associated with a particular user.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The mobile device <b>500</b> is manually synchronized with a host system by placing the mobile device <b>500</b> in an interface cradle, which couples the serial port <b>530</b> of the mobile device <b>500</b> to a serial port of the host system. The serial port <b>530</b> may also be used to insert authorization records onto the mobile device <b>500</b> and to download other application modules <b>524</b>N for installation on the mobile device <b>500</b>. This wired download path may further be used to load an encryption key onto the mobile device <b>500</b> for use in secure communications, which is a more secure method than exchanging encryption information via the wireless network <b>519</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Authorization records and additional application modules <b>524</b>N may be loaded onto the mobile device <b>500</b> through the network <b>519</b>, through an auxiliary I/O subsystem <b>528</b>, through the short-range communications subsystem <b>540</b>, or through any other suitable subsystem <b>542</b>, and installed by a user in the non-volatile memory <b>524</b> or RAM <b>526</b>. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile device <b>500</b> and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile device <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">When the mobile device <b>500</b> is operating in a data communication mode, a received signal, such as a text message or a web page download, will be processed by the transceiver <b>511</b> and provided to the microprocessor <b>538</b>, which preferably further processes the received signal for output to the display <b>522</b>, or, alternatively, to an auxiliary I/O device <b>528</b>. A user of the mobile device <b>500</b> may also compose data items, such as email messages, using the keyboard <b>532</b>, which is preferably a complete alphanumeric keyboard laid out in the QWERTY style, although other styles of complete alphanumeric keyboards such as the known DVORAK style may also be used. User input to the mobile device <b>500</b> is further enhanced with the plurality of auxiliary I/O devices <b>528</b>, which may include a thumbwheel input device, a touchpad, a variety of switches, a rocker input switch, etc. The composed data items input by the user are then transmitted over the communication network <b>519</b> via the transceiver <b>511</b>, provided a connection is allowed.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">When the mobile device <b>500</b> is operating in a voice communication mode, the overall operation of the mobile device <b>500</b> is substantially similar to the data mode, except that received signals are output to the speaker <b>534</b> and voice signals for transmission are generated by a microphone <b>536</b>. In addition, the secure messaging techniques described above might not necessarily be applied to voice communications. Alternative voice or audio I/O devices, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the mobile device <b>500</b>. Although voice or audio signal output is accomplished through the speaker <b>534</b>, the display <b>522</b> may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, the duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information. For example, the microprocessor <b>538</b>, in conjunction with the voice communication module <b>524</b>A and the operating system software, may detect the caller identification information of an incoming voice call and display it on the display <b>522</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A short-range communications subsystem <b>540</b> is also be included in the mobile device <b>500</b>. For example, the subsystem <b>540</b> may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a Bluetooth or 802.11 short-range wireless communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices. Thus, authorization record insertion and application loading operations as described above may be enabled on the mobile device <b>500</b> via the serial port <b>530</b> or other short-range communications subsystem <b>540</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">It will be appreciated that the above description relates to preferred embodiments by way of example only. Many variations on the systems and methods described above will be obvious to those knowledgeable in the field, and such obvious variations are within the scope of the application as described and claimed, whether or not expressly described.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">For example, although each entry in the connection policy store <b>36</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> associates a particular software application with a corresponding communication pipe, connection control information may have other formats. Connection control information may instead associate groups of software applications with a pipe. Software applications provided by the same source could be associated with the same pipe or pipes, for instance. Similarly, connection control information may associate one or more software applications with a group of pipes, such as all internal connections, all external connections, or all WAP connections, for example. Other types of connection groupings could be defined by a mobile device owner, or possibly a user where the user is trusted by the owner. Connection control information for groups of connections may include an identifier for each permitted connection in the group, or a connection group identifier which identifies the connections in the group.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">It is also contemplated that certain trusted software applications could be permitted to open both internal and external connections on a mobile device. A software application provided by an owner of the mobile device, for example, is generally trusted by the owner and might be allowed both internal and external connections. This may be accomplished in a connection policy store with an entry of the form shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for application C, for example, or an authorization record store where authorization records are used. All software applications provided by a mobile device owner or sources trusted by the owner, or only software applications identified in a trusted application list stored on the mobile device, could be permitted to open both types of connections.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Connection control information and authorization records need not necessarily be permissive. Software applications may also or instead be associated with connections that the software application is not permitted to use. Any attempts by a software application to open a prohibited connection identified in connection control information or an authorization record are then denied.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Where a mobile device user is trusted by the mobile device owner, the user may be prompted to choose whether a requested connection should be allowed for a software application. When a connection is denied, a message could be displayed to the user, indicating the type of connection requested and the software application requesting the connection. The user then has final authority over connection denial.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> represents a specific example of a mobile device in which connection control systems and methods described above may be implemented. Implementation of such systems and methods in other mobile devices having further, fewer, or different components than those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> would be obvious to one skilled in the art to which this application pertains. For example, although a SIM card has not been explicitly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it should be appreciated that implementation of connection control systems and methods in electronic devices with SIM cards is contemplated. Since SIM cards currently incorporate a memory component, connection control information, authorization records, or both, may be inserted onto a SIM card when or before the SIM card is provided to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The above description focuses on a detailed description of a mobile communication device as the environment for connection control. However, the principles and implementations discussed herein can be readily used in any remote communicating device. For instance, the remote communicating device implementing connection control could be any wired or wireless device including, without limitation, a PDA, a mobile phone, a notebook computer, a desktop computer, a hand-held computer, a mobile e-mail device or a pager.</p>
