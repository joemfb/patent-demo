<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 2009-59187, filed on Jun. 30, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to a display substrate, a method of manufacturing the display substrate and a liquid crystal display (LCD) device having the display substrate. More particularly, exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to a display substrate having an enhanced viewing angle and capable of reducing power consumption, a method of manufacturing the display substrate and an LCD device having the display substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, a liquid crystal display (LCD) device may be classified into a transmissive-type LCD device, a reflective-type LCD device, a transflective-type LCD device, etc. Since the transmissive-type LCD device has high visibility and high color reproducibility in an indoor space, the transmissive-type LCD device has been widely used. However, the visibility of the transmissive-type LCD device is decreased outdoors, and power consumption of the transmissive-type LCD device is high.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, the reflective-type LCD device has high visibility outdoors and does not employ an internal light source, for example, a backlight, so that the reflective-type LCD has a merit of low power consumption. However, the visibility of the reflective-type LCD device is decreased in a dark environment, such as an indoor space.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, a transflective-type LCD device has been developed, which has merits of the transmissive-type LCD and the reflective-type LCD device. That is, there is one light path passing through a liquid crystal layer in a transmissive area; however, incident light is reflected against a reflective plate to the liquid crystal layer so that the number of light paths passing the liquid crystal layer is two. Thus, a difference of phase delay exists in the two areas. In order to solve the problems associated with the phase delay, the transflective-type LCD is designed so that a cell gap of a liquid crystal layer in the transmissive area is twice as large as that of a cell gap of a liquid crystal layer in the reflective area.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, when such a multi-cell gap method is employed in a large-scale display panel, defects caused by dust or poor control of the director may occur in the large-scale display panel. Moreover, since the large-scale display panel uses a small number of cells, defects of one cell may cause a large problem during operation of the large-scale display panel.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a display substrate having an enhanced viewing angle and capable of reducing power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention also provide a method of manufacturing the above-mentioned display substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention also provide a liquid crystal display (LCD) having the above-mentioned display substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additional features of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An exemplary embodiment of the present invention discloses a display substrate including a base substrate, a reflective layer, a common electrode and a pixel electrode. The base substrate includes a pixel area having a transmissive area and a reflective area. The reflective layer is disposed in the reflective area of the base substrate. The common electrode includes a first sub-common electrode formed in the reflective area and a second sub-common electrode formed in the transmissive area. The pixel electrode includes a first sub-pixel electrode spaced apart from the first sub-common electrode by a first distance in the reflective area, and a second sub-pixel electrode spaced apart from the second sub-common electrode by a second distance substantially smaller than the first distance in the transmissive area.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An exemplary embodiment of the present invention also discloses a method of manufacturing a display substrate as follows. A reflective layer is formed in a base substrate comprising a pixel area having a transmissive area and a reflective area, in correspondence with the reflective area. A first sub-pixel electrode is formed in the reflective area, and a second sub-pixel electrode is formed in the transmissive area. A first sub-common electrode spaced apart from the first sub-pixel electrode by a first distance is formed in the reflective area, and a second sub-common electrode spaced apart from the second sub-pixel electrode by a second distance that is smaller than the first distance is formed in the transmissive area.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An exemplary embodiment of the present invention also discloses an LCD device including a display substrate, an opposite substrate and a liquid crystal layer. The display substrate includes a base substrate, a reflective layer, a common electrode and a pixel electrode. The base substrate includes a pixel area having a transmissive area and a reflective area. The reflective layer is disposed in the reflective area of the base substrate. The common electrode includes a first sub-common electrode formed in the reflective area and a second sub-common electrode formed in the transmissive area. The pixel electrode includes a first sub-pixel electrode spaced apart from the first sub-common electrode by a first distance in the reflective area, and a second sub-pixel electrode spaced apart from the second sub-common electrode by a second distance smaller than the first distance in the transmissive area. The opposite substrate faces the display substrate. The liquid crystal layer is disposed between the opposite substrate and the display substrate.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The invention is described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure is thorough, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the size and relative sizes of layers and regions may be exaggerated for clarity. Like reference numerals in the drawings denote like elements.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It will be understood that when an element or layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, it can be directly on, connected or coupled to the other element or layer, or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, there are no intervening elements or layers present. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, third etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term &#x201c;below&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular exemplary embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the present invention. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Exemplary embodiments of the invention are described herein with reference to cross-sectional illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized exemplary embodiments (and intermediate structures) of the present invention. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, exemplary embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle will, typically, have rounded or curved features and/or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a binary change from implanted to non-implanted region. Likewise, a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The electric field in the reflective area RA is weaker than that in the transmissive area TA so that the liquid crystal molecules in the electric field in the reflective area RA are inclined less than those in the transmissive area TA. Accordingly, a first phase delay corresponding to the reflective area RA is about half of a second phase delay corresponding to the transmissive area TA. That is, the phase delay through the whole area of the display panel is uniform because light passes once through the display panel corresponding to the transmissive area TA and light passes twice through the display panel corresponding to the reflective area RA. Thus, V-T curve characteristics of the reflective area RA and the transmissive area TA may be equal to each other. In addition, V-R curve characteristics of the reflective area RA and the transmissive area TA may be equal to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">When a liquid crystal display (LCD) device having the display panel uses the vertically aligned liquid crystal molecules, contrast ratio and viewing angle of the LCD device are improved.
