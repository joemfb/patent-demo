<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to a method for distributing digital certificates in vehicle-to-vehicle networks and, more particularly, to a method for distributing digital certificates in vehicle-to-vehicle networks which uses forward error correcting codes to encode a certificate into multiple segments and attaches the segments to multiple messages.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Wireless vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is becoming increasingly popular as a driver assistance mechanism. V2V communication can be used in systems which provide drivers with important advisories and warnings about the state of traffic in the surrounding environment. Security is an important part of V2V communication, since spurious advisories or warnings shown to a driver based on information from compromised nodes would lead to loss of confidence in the use of V2V systems. It is hence important that messages exchanged between nodes (vehicles) in V2V networks be secured against malicious entities intent on manipulating the system or disrupting the service.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Security in a V2V network can be provided by using digital signatures based on public key cryptography (PKC). An important requirement of PKC-based security protocols is the exchange of public keys through a secure and trusted channel. Digital certificates provide the means necessary for establishment of a secure channel to exchange the public key between a transmitting node and receiving nodes. A digital certificate, among other parameters, typically contains a unique certificate identifier, along with the public key, which is needed for message authentication. Since bandwidth in wireless V2V networks is at a premium, message size must be kept to a minimum. For this reason, a common strategy used in V2V networks is not to transmit a digital certificate with every message. Instead, a certificate may be appended only to messages at a certain interval, such as every fifth message, where the first, sixth, and eleventh messages include a full certificate, while the second through fifth and seventh through tenth messages include a certificate digest, and so forth. Then, when the next message containing a full certificate is received, the receiving node can validate that the preceding messages with certificate digests were in fact authentic. Since a certificate digest is considerably smaller than a certificate, this strategy accomplishes the objective of reducing message size.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, V2V networks are characterized by rapidly changing topology, signal strengths are sometimes marginal, and node density can be high. Thus, some transmitted messages can be lost. That is, some messages are not successfully received by nodes which should receive them. If a lost message happens to be one containing a full digital certificate, then the receiving node accumulates a backlog of messages which it cannot authenticate. As a result, performance of real-time messaging systems will suffer, and some critical information may be permanently lost.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is a need for a certificate distribution mechanism which minimizes message size, while simultaneously minimizing the potential negative impact of lost messages.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, a method is disclosed for improving the reliability and performance of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) networks where digital certificates are necessary for message authentication and some messages may be lost in transmission. The method uses Forward Error Correcting (FEC) codes to encode a digital certificate into multiple segments, and attaches one or more segment to each message transmitted. Nodes receiving the messages can reconstruct the certificate as long as they successfully receive a minimum number of the transmitted messages, where the minimum number is less than the total number of messages transmitted.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The following discussion of the embodiments of the invention directed to a digital certificate distribution mechanism using forward error correcting codes in vehicular networks is merely exemplary in nature, and is in no way intended to limit the invention or its applications or uses.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Wireless Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication networks have become increasingly common in automobiles. One of the most popular uses of V2V communication is in vehicle systems, such as collision warning systems. For example, a vehicle can report its position, velocity, and acceleration or braking status, such that other vehicles in the vicinity can receive this information via V2V communication and provide alerts or warnings to the driver if appropriate. Communications security is critical in these applications, since a message with inaccurate information, whether intentional or otherwise, could lead to an accident.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Public key cryptography (PKC) is typically used for message authentication in V2V networks. In public key cryptography, each user has a pair of cryptographic keys&#x2014;a public key and a private key. The private key is kept secret, while the public key may be widely distributed. The keys are related mathematically, but the private key cannot be feasibly derived from the public key. In public key cryptography, a digital certificate is an electronic document which uses a digital signature to bind together a public key with an identity&#x2014;which in the case of a V2V network is an identity of a vehicle or individual, or any other attribute that is uniquely associated with the entity. Using digital signatures, a message signed with a sender's private key can be verified by anyone who has access to the sender's public key, thereby proving that the sender had access to the private key, and that the message has not been tampered with. An important requirement of PKC-based security protocols is the transmission of a public key belonging to an entity to a receiver through a secure and authentic channel that prevents another entity from claiming ownership of the public key being transmitted. Digital Certificates are employed as a mechanism to enable a secure channel for transmission of public keys authentically.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Thus, digital certificates are an important enabler of the security necessary in V2V networks. However, certificates create overhead in V2V systems, both in terms of communication bandwidth and storage. It is desirable to minimize this overhead by not attaching a full digital certificate to every message transmitted. Current V2V standards for certificate distributions require a certificate to be appended to the transmitted messages periodically, based on an inter-certificate refresh period L. For example, if the inter-certificate refresh period L is set to five, then a certificate is appended to every 5<sup>th </sup>transmitted message, while the intervening four messages in each sequence are appended with a certificate digest. Certificate digests are 256-bit hash functions of a certificate. A cryptographic hash function is a deterministic procedure that takes an arbitrary block of data and returns a fixed-size bit string, the cryptographic hash value, such that an accidental or intentional change to the data will change the hash value. In this case, the data to be encoded is the digital certificate, and the hash value is the certificate digest (CD). The IEEE 1609.2 standard recommends using the lower 8 bytes of the 32-byte hash output, this being considered as a valid digest for the certificate. Thus, a certificate digest is only 8 bytes in size, while a full digital certificate is about 118 bytes in size. This approach, sending CD's instead of full certificates for the majority of messages, is designed to reduce bandwidth and storage overheads typically associated with transmitting packets with certificates appended to the message.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram of a network <b>30</b> of two vehicles communicating in a V2V environment per the current standard. In the network <b>30</b>, vehicle <b>10</b> is transmitting information, and vehicle <b>12</b> is receiving. For illustration and clarity purposes, the communication in the network <b>30</b> is described as being one-directional, that is, from the vehicle <b>10</b> to the vehicle <b>12</b>. In reality, each vehicle participating in a vehicle-to-vehicle network would both transmit and receive information, using an onboard transceiver for transmitting and receiving message packets, and an onboard controller or processor for processing message data and using it in an application. V2V applications require frequent communication of vehicle kinematical information, on the order of 10 messages per second. Therefore, there is a constant stream of messages being exchanged by vehicles in a given network topology. In V2V terminology, a communication packet consists of both a message payload, represented by M in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, along with its appended certificate (C) or certificate digest (CD). The message payload includes useful application data, along with numerous data fields containing information about the message, such as security type and transmission data rate, as specified by the IEEE 1609.2 standard.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In this scenario, the inter-certificate refresh period L is set to five. The vehicle <b>10</b> sends packet <b>14</b>, which contains both a message payload and a full digital certificate. If the vehicle <b>12</b> receives the packet <b>14</b>, the vehicle <b>12</b> can verify the authenticity of the packet <b>14</b> via the certificate. The vehicle <b>12</b> can then use the application data in the message payload, which in this case is kinematical data for the vehicle <b>10</b>, in its application software. Further, upon successful reception of the digital certificate and verification, the vehicle <b>12</b> stores the certificate in its cache for a time interval as determined by the recommended privacy settings or certificate expiry time. All messages corresponding to this digital certificate received within this time interval no longer need to wait for the reception of another digital certificate. Instead the certificate digests of these packets are verified through a simple operation that involves computing the hash of the stored digital certificate and comparison of the last 8 bytes of the computed hash with the received certificate digests. Upon expiry of the time interval, the certificate is flushed out and the entire process repeats.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">If the packet <b>14</b> is not received by the vehicle <b>12</b>, there are consequences for not only the packet <b>14</b>, but also for subsequent packets, as will be seen. The vehicle <b>10</b> then proceeds to send packets <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, and <b>22</b>, each of which contains a message and a certificate digest. The vehicle <b>12</b> may receive all of the packets <b>16</b>-<b>22</b>. However, if the packet <b>14</b> was not successfully received and no digital certificate is available in cache, the vehicle <b>12</b> cannot verify the authenticity of the packets <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> until it receives another full digital certificate, which will enable it to verify the CD which was attached to the packets <b>16</b>-<b>22</b>. In the case where no valid certificate is available in cache, the vehicle <b>12</b> must store the packets <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> in a buffer for later use if buffer space is available. If insufficient buffer space is available, some or all of the packets <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> may be dropped, resulting in a loss of useful information.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The vehicle <b>10</b> then sends packet <b>24</b>, which includes a data message and a full digital certificate. If the vehicle <b>12</b> receives the packet <b>24</b>, and if the packets <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> are still stored in the buffer, the vehicle <b>12</b> can verify the authenticity of the stored packets <b>16</b>-<b>22</b>, and can then use the data from the messages in the packets <b>16</b>-<b>24</b> in its application software. However, if the vehicle <b>12</b> fails to receive the packet <b>24</b>, the vehicle <b>12</b> cannot authenticate the packets <b>16</b>-<b>22</b>, and therefore cannot use the data from the messages in the packets <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> in its application software. In that case, the vehicle <b>12</b> can only keep the packets <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> in storage, until it receives a full certificate which can be used to validate them. But the vehicle <b>10</b> will not send another full digital certificate for five more messages. If even one certificate-carrying packet is lost, at a transmission frequency of 10 packets per second, it can be seen that some data messages may be delayed from being used in the application software by almost one full second. This is a long time for a collision warning system. If the next certificate-carrying packet also happens to be lost, the time delay of the data becomes even worse, some packets may have to be dropped from the receiver's buffer, and the application's performance will continue to deteriorate.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In real V2V communication networks, packet losses are a fact of life. There are many reasons that a transmitted packet may not be received by some nodes in a network. One of the fundamental characteristics of vehicular networks is the mobility of nodes relative to each other, leading to a high rate of changes in network topology. Hence, node mobility contributes to nodes moving in and out of communication range of neighboring nodes, thus increasing the likelihood of packet loss in transmission. Packet collisions, where two or more nodes attempt to send a packet across the network at the same time, also contribute to the problem of packet loss. In addition, buffer overflows in receiving nodes can also lead to packet loss. Given these realities of V2V networks, some messages and some digital certificates are bound to be lost, leading to the data delay or data loss condition detailed above. To avoid this problem, two different adaptive methodologies for digital certificate distribution are proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a first embodiment, the inter-certificate refresh period L is varied to adapt to current V2V network conditions. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the two goals to be balanced are minimizing security-related communications overhead, while maximizing V2V message throughput. It is desirable from an overhead minimization standpoint to increase the value of L; that is, to use relatively more certificate digests and fewer certificates. However, this strategy guarantees that more messages will have to be buffered by receiving nodes before being used in their application software, and it increases the potential negative impact of a dropped certificate-carrying packet&#x2014;possibly leading to the loss of useful information. On the other hand, reducing the value of L increases the amount of overhead due to security-related data on a per-message basis, and could increase the chance that any particular message will be lost in a congested network.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Many factors can affect the performance of a V2V network at any particular time. These factors include the number of participating nodes (vehicles), the spatial and mobility patterns of the nodes, bandwidth saturation, the tolerance to delays of the application software used in the vehicles, characteristics of the physical channel, and others. Because these factors and their effects can vary so widely, it is not possible to select a single value of the inter-certificate refresh period L which will provide the best results under all conditions. Therefore, an adaptive strategy is proposed, in which the value of L may be varied, up or down, based on current network conditions. In this approach, a controller would be programmed to periodically monitor the V2V network factors described above, such as number of participating nodes and bandwidth saturation. Based on the monitored conditions of the network, and empirical data on network performance as a function of the various factors, the controller would select an optimum value of L to use for an interval of time. Monitoring of network conditions and selecting an optimum value of L would be repeated periodically, in order to maintain network throughput at or near its peak value. It may also be desirable to have the interval of time, during which the value of L is fixed, be a variable amount. That is, in some network conditions, monitoring and re-establishing a value of L may occur more frequently than in other network conditions. Actual network performance, as measure by the rate at which useful message data is being processed by receiving nodes, could also be measured and used to establish the optimum value of the inter-certificate refresh period L.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow chart diagram <b>100</b> of a process for distributing digital certificates using a variable inter-certificate refresh period L. At box <b>102</b>, wireless communications are established between two or more vehicles in a vehicle-to-vehicle network. For the purposes of this discussion, the vehicles <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be referenced, where the vehicle <b>10</b> is transmitting messages and the vehicle <b>12</b> is receiving messages. At box <b>104</b>, the vehicle <b>10</b> employs a digital certificate, which was pre-installed in the onboard processor prior to start of V2V operation. At box <b>106</b>, the vehicle <b>10</b> creates a certificate digest as a hash function of the digital certificate. At box <b>108</b>, the vehicle <b>10</b> defines a value for the inter-certificate refresh period L. As described above, the value of L may be established based on measured network conditions, such as node density and bandwidth saturation. Alternatively, the value of L may be established and continuously updated based on actual network performance, which may be defined as the rate at which useful message data is being processed into receiving nodes' applications. At box <b>110</b>, the vehicle <b>10</b> transmits a message packet over the vehicle-to-vehicle network. Transmission continues at <b>10</b> messages per second, or whatever frequency is dictated by the applications being used. Each message packet contains useful message data and other data fields, along with either a digital certificate or a certificate digest, as prescribed by the inter-certificate refresh period.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">At box <b>112</b>, the vehicle <b>12</b> receives the transmitted message packet. At decision diamond <b>114</b>, the vehicle <b>12</b> checks to see if the received packet contains a full certificate or a certificate digest. If a full certificate was received, the vehicle <b>12</b> computes a digest of the certificate at box <b>116</b>. At box <b>118</b>, the vehicle <b>12</b> checks a certificate digest store for previously received certificate digests. At decision diamond <b>120</b>, the vehicle <b>12</b> checks to see if a digest exists which matches the one computed at the box <b>116</b> for the just-received certificate. If so, this means that a message has previously been received from the same transmitting vehicle <b>10</b>, and the public key associated with the matching stored certificate digest can be used to verify the received message at box <b>122</b>. At box <b>124</b>, the useful message data from the received message can be used in the application by the vehicle <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">If no matching certificate digest is found at the decision diamond <b>120</b>, then the digital certificate must be verified by the vehicle <b>12</b> at box <b>126</b>, using a certificate verification algorithm of the type known to those skilled in the art. At decision diamond <b>128</b>, the vehicle <b>12</b> checks to see if the certificate verification was successful at the box <b>126</b>. If so, then the received message can be verified with the corresponding public key at box <b>130</b>. At box <b>132</b>, the vehicle <b>12</b> computes a digest of the received certificate and saves it in the certificate digest store for future use. At box <b>134</b>, the useful message data from the received message can be used in the application by the vehicle <b>12</b>. If verification was not successful at the decision diamond <b>128</b>, then the vehicle <b>12</b> will drop the received message at box <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">From the decision diamond <b>114</b>, if the received message contains a certificate digest, the vehicle <b>12</b> checks the certificate digest store at box <b>138</b>. If a matching certificate digest is found at decision diamond <b>140</b>, the vehicle <b>12</b> verifies the message at box <b>142</b> and uses the message data at box <b>144</b>, as was described previously for the boxes <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>. If no matching certificate digest is found at the decision diamond <b>140</b>, then the received message cannot currently be verified and used, so the vehicle <b>12</b> can only store the message at box <b>146</b>, or drop the message if sufficient buffer space is not available. The steps of the boxes <b>112</b> through <b>146</b> are used in typical V2V operations today, and are detailed here to show the importance of not experiencing a lengthy delay in receiving a full digital certificate.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In any pass through the process of the diagram <b>100</b>, the vehicle <b>10</b> can define a new value for the inter-certificate refresh period L at the box <b>108</b>, based on changes to the measured network conditions, or changes in the actual network performance. The vehicle <b>10</b> need not communicate the value of L to other vehicles in the network. The vehicle <b>10</b> can simply use the value of L that is determined to provide the best network performance, and send digital certificates and CD's accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The adaptive strategy of varying the inter-certificate refresh period L has a number of advantages. First, the method employing a variable L can be used in networks together with nodes which use the traditional fixed-L methodology, with no changes of hardware or software required from any of the nodes. Nodes which use the traditional fixed-L methodology could continue to operate as normal, but they would see the benefit of improved communications throughput in messages they receive from the node which uses the variable-L method in messages it transmits. Second, a node which uses the variable-L method does not need to communicate the value of L to the receiving nodes. The receiving nodes can receive and process packets as they would in a fixed-L environment, verifying the authenticity of preceding CD's each time a full certificate is received. Finally, the variable-L method creates no additional overhead compared to the traditional fixed-L method, which is an important criterion in a V2V network.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a second embodiment, Forward Error Correction techniques can be used, where a certificate is divided among several packets, and the certificate can be reconstructed even if some packets are lost by the receiver. Forward Error Correcting (FEC) codes can be used as a means to recover data in lossy environments. By over-sampling the input data, FEC codes create data larger than the input, such that the loss of a few data segments in transmission will not prevent the receiver from reconstructing the original data completely. Applied to the problem of certificate transmission in V2V networks, FEC codes offer a mechanism for receiving nodes to reliably recover certificates, thus reducing the information blockage to the application layer and reducing the need for re-transmission of data. Two different types of FEC codes&#x2014;Erasure Codes and Fountain Codes&#x2014;are proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram of a schema <b>60</b> showing how erasure codes are used to encode and decode data. Erasure codes are a form of FEC codes which can be used to reconstruct original source data in spite of a loss of a certain number of data packets during transmission. Source data <b>40</b> is comprised of a number of segments k. In the case of a digital certificate, the 118 bytes of certificate data can be divided into any suitable number of segments k. In the schema <b>60</b>, k is shown to be equal to 8, but the value of k could be larger or smaller than 8. An encoding module <b>42</b> encodes the k segments of the source data <b>40</b> into n segments of transmitted data <b>44</b>, where n&#x3e;k. During transmission, some data segments <b>46</b> may be lost. Therefore, received data <b>48</b> may contain some number k&#x2032; of data segments, where k&#x2032;&#x3c;n. As long as the number k&#x2032; of data segments in the received data <b>48</b> is greater than or equal to k, a decoding module <b>50</b> can decode the received data <b>48</b> into reconstructed data <b>52</b> which is identical to the source data <b>40</b>, consisting of k segments. The k&#x2032; segments of the received data <b>48</b> can include any of the n segments of the transmitted data <b>44</b>. That is, there are no requirements that any particular segment must be recovered, nor that two adjacent segments cannot be lost. It is only required that a number k&#x2032; of unique segments be contained in the received data, where k&#x2032;&#x2267;k.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The fundamental concept of erasure codes lies in the existence of an encoding function &#x192;(X), which acts upon the k-dimensional input vector X and produces an n dimensional output vector Z. The encoding function has the property that &#x192;(X)+&#x192;(Y)=&#x192;(X+Y) and can be represented by a matrix A. Hence, encoding is simply a matrix-vector multiplication leading to the matrix Z. Erasure codes are known to those skilled in the art of numerical methods, and need not be detailed further.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram of a network <b>80</b> of two vehicles in a V2V environment, showing how erasure codes can be applied to the transmission of digital certificates. In the network <b>80</b>, vehicle <b>62</b> is transmitting information, and vehicle <b>64</b> is receiving, no certificate digests are used, and certificates are encoded into multiple packets using erasure codes. To illustrate the use of erasure codes in this example, the source data, which is the digital certificate, is divided into five segments. That is, k=5. The five source data segments are encoded into six transmitted data segments. That is, n=6. The vehicle <b>62</b> transmits a first packet <b>66</b>, containing a message payload M and a first erasure code segment E<b>1</b>. The vehicle <b>64</b> receives and stores the first packet <b>66</b>. The vehicle <b>62</b> proceeds to send packets <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>, and <b>72</b>, each of which is received and stored by the vehicle <b>64</b>. At this point, the vehicle <b>64</b> has received four packets, and hence, four erasure code segments, from the vehicle <b>62</b>. The vehicle <b>64</b> cannot yet decode the certificate, because it has not yet received enough data segments. The vehicle <b>62</b> then sends data packet <b>74</b>, containing a fifth erasure code segment E<b>5</b>. However, the packet <b>74</b> is lost in transmission, and is not received by the vehicle <b>64</b>. The vehicle <b>62</b> then sends packet <b>76</b>, containing a sixth erasure code segment E<b>6</b>. The packet <b>76</b> is received by the vehicle <b>64</b>. This represents a fifth erasure code segment received by the vehicle <b>64</b>, which enables the vehicle <b>64</b> to decode the certificate, authenticate the messages <b>66</b>-<b>72</b> and <b>76</b>, and use all of the message data in its application. The vehicle <b>62</b> repeats the transmission sequence after n=6 packets. It is noted that with the erasure code methodology described herein, a single lost packet does not have the potential to cause an entire series of packets to be unusable by the receiver, as is the case with the traditional methodology shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> when a certificate-carrying packet is lost.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Another form of Forward Error Correcting codes is known as fountain codes. Fountain codes are a class of FEC codes that are capable of producing an infinite set of output segments for a given set of input segments, such that the original input segments can be recovered or reconstructed from any subset of the encoded output segments of size equal to or only slightly greater than the number of input source segments. The number of output segments can also be finite. Fountain code theory is also known to those skilled in the art of numerical methods, and efficient encoding and decoding algorithms exist for making practical use of fountain codes.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram of a schema <b>90</b> showing how fountain codes are used to encode data. As was the case with erasure codes, the source data needs to be divided into a number k of input segments <b>92</b>. With fountain codes, there is no defined number n of encoded data segments. Rather, the number k of input segments <b>92</b> are encoded into an infinite number of output segments <b>94</b>. When the encoded output segments <b>94</b> are transmitted in messages across a network, the receiving node can decode the original input segments <b>92</b> when a number k&#x2032; of segments is received, such that k&#x2032;=(1+&#x3b5;)k. According to fountain code theory, the number k&#x2032; need only be slightly larger than k; that is, &#x3b5;&#x3c;&#x3c;1. For example, if the source data is divided into five input segments <b>92</b> (k=5), decoding should be possible when six output segments <b>94</b> are received.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Applying fountain codes to the problem of transmitting a digital certificate in a V2V network then becomes straightforward. The source data is the digital certificate, and a value of k must be selected. The certificate is divided into k input segments <b>92</b>, and fountain codes are used to generate an ongoing stream of output segments <b>94</b>. Each of the output segments <b>94</b> is appended to a message payload in a communication packet which is transmitted over the V2V network. A receiving node receives and stores the received packets until a minimum of k&#x2032; encoded segments are received. The receiving node then decodes the source data, and recovers the digital certificate to authenticate the messages received. At that point, the data in the message payloads can be processed in the receiver's application, such as a collision warning system. It is noted that the fountain code methodology is very tolerant of lost packets. A receiving node can continue to buffer received packets until a number k&#x2032; of encoded segments are received, even if several packets have been lost in the interim. Again with fountain codes, a single lost packet does not have the potential to cause an entire series of packets to be unusable by the receiver, as is the case with the traditional methodology shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> when a certificate-carrying packet is lost. Variations on the fountain code methodology can also be employed by the transmitting node. For example, the transmitting node can re-start the fountain code sequence after a certain amount of time has passed or a certain number of packets have been sent, and the transmitting node would re-start the sequence any time a new digital certificate needed to be used as dictated by the certificate expiry time or privacy concerns.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow chart diagram <b>200</b> of a process for distributing digital certificates using forward error correcting codes to encode the certificates for transmission. At box <b>202</b>, wireless communications are established between two or more vehicles in a vehicle-to-vehicle network. For the purposes of this discussion, the vehicles <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> will be referenced, where the vehicle <b>62</b> is transmitting messages and the vehicle <b>64</b> is receiving messages. At box <b>204</b>, the vehicle <b>62</b> employs a digital certificate, which has been pre-installed in its onboard processor. At box <b>206</b>, the vehicle <b>62</b> divides the digital certificate into a group of source data segments. The group of source data segments has a size of k, as described previously. At box <b>208</b>, the vehicle <b>62</b> encodes the group of source data segments into a larger group of transmitted data segments. For erasure codes, the group of transmitted data segments has a size of n; for fountain codes, the group of transmitted data segments can be infinite in size. At box <b>210</b>, the vehicle <b>62</b> transmits message packets over the V2V network. The message packets contain the encoded transmitted data segments and useful message data.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">At box <b>212</b>, the vehicle <b>64</b> receives the message packets, and stores the data segments and message data in a buffer. At box <b>214</b>, the vehicle <b>64</b> decodes the received data segments into a group of reconstructed data segments. This can only be done when a sufficient number of data segments have been received, as explained previously. For erasure codes, the number of received data segments must be greater than or equal to the number of source data segments. That is, k&#x2032;&#x2267;k. For fountain codes, the number of received data segments must be slightly greater than the number of source data segments. That is, k&#x2032;=(1+&#x3b5;)k, where &#x3b5;&#x3c;&#x3c;1. In either case, erasure codes or fountain codes, the receiving vehicle <b>64</b> can reconstruct the source data even if some message packets are lost in transmission. At box <b>216</b>, the vehicle <b>64</b> uses the reconstructed data segments to re-create the digital certificate sent by the vehicle <b>62</b>. At box <b>218</b>, the vehicle <b>64</b> uses the digital certificate to verify the authenticity of the message packets it has received. And at box <b>220</b>, the vehicle <b>64</b> processes the useful message data it has received in its application.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Other strategies can be employed to improve the reliability and performance of V2V network communications where digital certificates are distributed using FEC codes. One strategy that can be used is to adaptively change the encoding parameters k and n in response to network conditions, where the parameter k applies to both erasure codes and fountain codes, and the value of n applies only to erasure codes. For example, some network conditions may dictate that the values of k and n both be made larger, while other network conditions may yield better performance when both k and n are smaller. Also, for a given value of k, a network which is experiencing very few lost packets may provide the best results by setting n=k+1. But in a very lossy network environment, the value of n may need to be significantly higher than k. Although adaptively changing the values of n and k may be an effective strategy for dealing with variable network conditions, it is noted that certificate segments created for certain values of n and k are incompatible with certificate segments created for different values of n and/or k.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Another strategy which can be used to optimize V2V network performance is to append more than one FEC encoded segment to each transmitted packet, under certain network conditions. That is, even where the encoding parameters k and n are chosen and held constant, it is possible and permissible to append more than one encoded segment to each packet, in order to maximize the rate at which message data is received, authenticated, and processed into the receiving node's application. Thus, if k=5 and n=6, and two segments are attached to each packet, the receiving node would have enough segments to decode the certificate after receiving three packets. The strategy of appending more than one encoded data segment to each message packet applies to both erasure codes and fountain codes.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Given the wide variation in V2V network topologies&#x2014;including number of nodes in the network, vehicle to vehicle ranges, bandwidth saturation, etc. &#x2014;it is impossible to select values for the encoding parameters n and k, and a number of segments per packet, which will produce the optimum results under all network conditions. For example, in the erasure code model, setting the value of n much higher than k will result in each encoded segment being larger, which increases network traffic. But setting the value of n too low may result in less tolerance of lost packets. Likewise, increasing the ratio of segments per packet allows the receiving node to decode the certificate after receiving fewer packets, but it also increases the likelihood of dropped packets due to the increased packet size. These tradeoffs are known and understood, and network performance could be empirically measured across a wide range of network conditions for different combinations of parameters. Such an empirical study would allow an adaptive strategy to be implemented which periodically updates the values of the encoding parameters and the ratio of segments per packet, using the combination which would yield maximum data throughput under current network conditions.</p>
