<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to Energy Management and Control Systems (EMCS), and in particular, systems, methods, and apparatuses for implementing a roll-lock snap-on current transformer which operates within or complementary to an energy management and control system.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The subject matter discussed in the background section should not be assumed to be prior art merely as a result of its mention in the background section. Similarly, a problem mentioned in the background section or associated with the subject matter of the background section should not be assumed to have been previously recognized in the prior art. The subject matter in the background section merely represents different approaches, which in and of themselves may also correspond to disclosed embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Previously known energy management and control systems are not sufficiently integrated into the fabric of the control panels and wiring at a circuit level.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Previously known energy management and control systems are incapable of sufficient integration inside electrical panels. For example, such systems provide no mechanism by which a monitoring device may clamp on to a wire innocuously with no wires hanging out in order to meet common Fire Marshal requirements for safety. Previously known clamp-on CTs (Current Transformers) installed into a facility and its circuits to characterize energy usage must be removed before the Fire Marshal arrives because such previously known clamp-on CTs result in a &#x201c;rats nest&#x201d; of wiring and instrumentation hanging out of the panels or off the wiring in which cannot pass a Fire Marshal inspection, and thus, does not permit permanent on-going usage and installation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Previously known energy management and control systems lack energy monitoring current transformer based units with algorithms to perform statistical analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present state of the art may therefore benefit from systems, methods, devices, and apparatuses for implementing a roll-lock snap-on current transformer and associated and complementary PeakPower Energy Management and Control Systems as described herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A PeakPower Commander System provides local or remote control of power and other utilities and devices, including security, for commercial, industrial or residential applications. Energy Sensors may plug into a circuit breaker panel with existing Breakers, or snap onto the wiring near a piece of equipment in accordance with various disclosed embodiments set forth below.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Described herein are systems, devices, methods, and apparatuses for implementing a roll-lock snap-on current transformer and associated and complementary PeakPower Energy Management and Control Systems.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a particular embodiment, a PeakPower Energy Management and Control System has one or more roll-lock snap-on current transformer power monitoring devices, each to avoid interrupting power when installing current and/or power monitors. Each roll-lock snap-on current transformer power monitoring device may be snapped onto existing power wires inside a power panel or near equipment being monitored without disconnecting any wires or turning off power. Each roll-lock snap-on current transformer power monitoring device may be utilized in standalone mode as well as within a PeakPower Energy Management and Control System in accordance with disclosed embodiments. Each roll-lock snap-on current transformer power monitoring device may communicate via the power lines (via a Power Line Controller (&#x201c;PLC&#x201d;)) or communicate via wireless using an integrated microprocessor based RF transceiver.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The disclosed embodiments enable analysis which is not available within previously known power management and monitoring mechanisms. For instance, the disclosed embodiments enable Least Mean Squares best fits, first and second derivatives, power spectral densities, autocorrelations, cross correlations, probability density functions. The disclosed embodiments enable first and second derivatives and use of historical graphs and graphs of similar equipment to anticipate equipment abnormalities and potential failures as well as comparing the energy consumption patterns of a piece of equipment at one location to the same or similar type of equipment at another location.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Through the practice of the disclosed embodiments, it is not necessary to interrupt power and there are no screws to loosen or tighten. In one embodiment, a small Linux based system (e.g., a PeakPower Gateway collects all the data on-site at each building and forwards it to a main server(s) at a Data Center.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment, a PeakPower Commander System is closed-loop. It not only senses and analyzes the energy and utilities, it also provides closed loop control, for example, it will monitor temperature, reset a thermostat or turn on/off an air conditioning unit, parking lot lights, etc. locally or remotely and it is Plug-n-Play for simplicity.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one embodiment, parts of a PeakPower System include, for example:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0045">1) The PeakPower Server with its real-time acquisition/analysis software and adaptive algorithms is the highest level where data is gathered, processed, analyzed, and the results are sent to clients.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0046">2) The PeakPower Gateway is the intermediate level, gathering all data in one building and forwarding it to server.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0047">3) Sensors and closed-loop controls including:
        <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0048">a. The PeakPower Wired and/or Wireless Roll-Lock SnapOn Current Transformer based Energy Sensor monitors;</li>
            <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0049">b. The PeakPower Wireless Temperature/Pressure/Humidity Sensors;</li>
            <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0050">c. The PeakPower Wired or Wireless Water Flow Sensors;</li>
            <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0051">d. The PeakPower Wired or Wireless Gas Flow Sensors;</li>
            <li id="ul0003-0005" num="0052">e. The PeakPower Wireless Thermostat Controllers; and</li>
            <li id="ul0003-0006" num="0053">f. The PeakPower Wired or Wireless Zero Energy Multi-Stable Relay Controller.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0054">Items a thru d in the list above are Sensors and items e and f are Controllers. However, a relay may also control a solenoid valve to shut-off water, refrigerants or other liquids if there is a leak or if something is left on at an odd time that doesn't correlate well with the normal usage pattern. In one embodiment, the system is continually gathering and cataloging data into its knowledgebase.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0055">Note that reference to the term &#x201c;PeakPower&#x201d; is short for a power monitoring system enabled via the disclosed embodiments set forth herein, or a reference to components of the PeakPower system, enabled by the disclosed embodiments, such as components of a power monitoring system which are disclosed herein and may be used in conjunction with a power monitoring system. Some components, such as the roll-lock snap-on current transformer power monitoring device disclosed herein may be used in conjunction with a PeakPower system as disclosed, used with other power monitoring systems, or used in a stand-alone mode, absent a power monitoring system of any kind.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0056">In one embodiment, the PeakPower system and all these sensors/controllers are local area networked to a Gateway node which is connected through the Internet on a Wide Area Network, through a firewall.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0057">In one embodiment, the PeakPower System saves a large amount of energy by peak flattening. Certain hours of the day, the electric companies experience Peak Demand and they charge commercial customers based on that peak usage. In one embodiment, the PeakPower System gleans these peak hours from the web, then it pre-cools all freezers, chillers, coolers, HVACs etc, prior to the peak times (such as just prior to, or at a time sufficient to enable energy used to cool to a determined threshold to be expended during the non-peak time), to minimize energy usage during peak times. In one embodiment, it also re-schedules defrost cycles for peak usage times to minimize or flatten the peak usage. PeakPower software tracks peak hours based on the location of each installation.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0058">In one embodiment, the PeakPower monitoring and controlling software is adaptive insomuch as it extracts the unique signature of each piece of equipment real-time and correlates it with its historical signatures as well as the normal signature and specifications from the manufacturer, which the PeakPower software periodically gleans from the web. In one embodiment, it also correlates it to signatures on similar pieces of equipment and derives variances.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0059">In one embodiment, the PeakPower System maintains a knowledge base of all similar equipment and it can predict failures by even subtle changes in the signatures. It can determine if there is a refrigerator door is open. It can determine if something is going wrong in a piece of equipment and it sends an alert or alarm quickly to a designated person so they can take action or sign onto the portal to see the magnitude of any issues.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0060">In one embodiment, the PeakPower System has an interactive portal which may be used on a Smartphone, Tablet, PC, Pad or other computing devices for delivering local and/or remote monitoring and alerts/alarms 24&#xd7;7 of an entire building. It has an online dashboard. Alert/Alarm messages may be sent to anyone designated. They receive the alert/alarm message via email, text, and/or voice. The designee may then logon to the interactive portal and examine on a very detailed basis, the data for each piece of equipment. They have access to that data on a password-protected basis to look at each piece of equipment, the whole building of equipment, an entire chain of buildings or around the world for Multi-National Companies.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0061">Over time, as the PeakPower knowledge Base grows larger, the PeakPower System gets smarter and smarter about all of the diversity of equipment, in buildings around the world in accordance with the disclosed embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0062">Applicants have recognized an unfulfilled need for an Energy Monitoring Current Transformer that fits cleanly either inside the Circuit Breaker Panel or on the wiring near the equipment being monitored to report energy usage without additional wires (i.e. it uses Wireless, RF and/or PLC) so that wires, pig-tails, and leads do not extend from the Energy Monitoring Current Transformer, so as to comply with local code and Fire Marshall safety requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0063">Practice of the disclosed embodiments may provide a highly integrated, innocuous (almost invisible) energy management and control system hardware/software/system, which may be monitored and controlled over the Internet from virtually anywhere in the world.</p>

The wireless digital valves for water and gas controls are not shown. The PeakPower System includes a Gateway device at each location to gather and manage the data at that site and it forwards that data up to the main server(s) for further processing, analysis and closed loop control. This diagram includes most of the monitoring and control devices in a PeakPower System: (e.g. RLSO-CT based Current Sensors, Temperature Sensors, Pressure Sensors, Humidity Sensors, Gas Flow Sensors, Liquid Flow Sensors, Thermostats, Multi-Stable Relays each a clamp-on type sensor, probe, or shunt, capable of detecting waveforms). Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for details. This diagram illustrates how some pieces of the system fit together and communicate in a power monitoring application.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0078">Note that equipment power usage characteristics and curves on a piece of equipment in Location <b>1</b> may be analyzed and correlated with the patterns observed on the same type equipment in Location <b>2</b> or Location n and adjusted for environmental conditions, to determine if it is outside an adaptively determined corridor of operation. If so, an ALERT or an ALARM will be set dependent on how far outside limits it is or how rapidly (derivative) it is proceeding to go out of limits. Very subtle deviations in trends are detected and reported, before they become an emergency.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0079">The PeakPower Management and Control Apparatus that includes sensors, relays, acquisition, processing and analysis software and operational user interface. The sensors monitor power in the power lines, they also derive all the power to drive the monitor module apparatus from the power lines they are monitoring. These modules also communicate over power lines all without making physical contact with said power lines.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0080">The Power Management and Control Software <b>240</b> performs statistical analysis on all signals including least mean squares, first and second derivatives, FFTs auto and cross correlations, modal analyses and uses a large library of algorithms to analyze data acquired in real-time versus historical data as well as correlating it with manufacturers specs as well as data from the same model of equipment in other locations to detect early warning signs of potential failures or anomalies in the power used by this equipment versus other same or similar equipment in order to optimize energy use and all but eliminate emergencies.</p>

The PeakPower System gives the operator timely data to make critical decisions instantly. There is a set of Red, Yellow, and Green indicators (like idiot lights) across the top (or bottom) of the screen where the overall status of all entities being monitors is viewable at a glance. The Red ones always bubble up toward the top of the screen toward the upper left corner and simultaneously sound the buzzer.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0082">If multiple ALARMS occur the second one bubbles to the right upper corner then the tower left corner then finally the lower right corner if four alarms occur before they can be corrected and reset to green status. After the screen is full, the idiot lights at the top are used to manage further red and yellow ALARMS and ALERTS. As the ALERTS come back within range they automatically turn Green, however an ALARM should be corrected back into normal range, then the operator clicks on the corresponding Idiot Light to RESET it to GREEN.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0083">Embodiments of the present disclosure describe a PeakPower System, which includes the Peak Power Commander Sensor Module. The Peak Power System provides local and/or remote control of various aspects of device operation (e.g., power, security, etc.) for commercial, industrial and/or residential applications.

<p id="p-0084" num="0092">One element of the PeakPower COMMANDER is the communications methodology. The PeakPower COMMANDER utilizes the RLSO-CTs for communications, obviating the need for physically connecting to the wire(s); Refer also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0093">Using such a technique, the current and voltage on the Wire(s) is 90 degrees out of phase. Refer also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> for an illustration of this relationship. Using other techniques (e.g. X-10), the communications must occur at or near the Voltage zero crossing when the voltage in the line is at a low ebb. The presently disclosed PeakPower COMMANDER, however, is more flexible. Since it utilizes a Current Transformer to communicate, it can also transmit and receive when the Line Voltage is at or near its MAXIMUM, because that is when the Current is near zero. The PeakPower COMMANDER typically sends or receives high frequency pulses during a preset narrow window of time relative to a cycle (typically 50 Hz or 60 Hz). Also, the position of the pulse(s) within this window may be further interpreted to yield even more data bits per cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0094">The liquid and gas flowmeters in the preferred embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may use Doppler technology, or Magnetic-Inductive or Coriolis type sensor pickups.

<p id="p-0087" num="0095">The RLSO-CTs can optionally communicate in Power Line Controller (PLC) mode. The RLSO-CTs are modulated with a high voltage signal to send data over the power lines using non-contact induction.

<p id="p-0153" num="0161">For instance, if you have sixteen compressors, which many supermarkets do, then the overall MBTF for Compressors alone is 2,125 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0162">This means that you will likely have a compressor failure about four times per year. For sixteen condensers, the overall MBTF is 1,625 hours. That is almost six times per year.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0163">With 16 compressors AND 16 condensers at the same location, the MTBF there is 920 hours. That is almost 10 failures per year, almost once a month. PeakPower Commander acts like a sentinel, silently watching for subtle signs and adjusting power levels, temperatures, or equipment features. It warns of trouble before a problem starts to become critical, such as days or potentially weeks before a problem goes critical. A silent page or text on your cell phone or computer to alert you to the fact that something is going amiss, prompting maintenance persons to proactively fix it, replace a filter, etc. before it becomes an emergency. This would also solve problems with dirt accumulation or wearing down on equipment, showing up as increased power consumption. Detecting dirty filters can save 5% per year, by way of one example.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0164"><b>2310</b> illustrates the Power-On signature of a compressor and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2320</figref> illustrates the steady state signature of that same compressor, prior to the bearings starting to overheat, which causes it to draw more power.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0165"><b>2320</b> illustrates another area of energy savings. When a compressor starts to fail, it exhibits a distinctive increase in power consumption. In this case, over a 42 day (6 weeks) time period, the energy consumed by this compressor rose by 50% from 40 KWhr to 60 KWhr. It is nonlinear, so the average is about 15% aver six weeks.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0166">Since the MTBFs are about 10 failures per year for most medium to large stores, this translates into an average of over 15% per month overall. This same failure mechanism is exhibited on the other types of equipment in a supermarket also, condensers, fans, etc.</p>

<p id="p-0160" num="0168"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> illustrates how the PeakPower System acquires the high resolution signature used for processing and analyzing the Power-On signatures. During Steady State mode it is sufficient to sample every 10 sec, to 15 sec, normally, but during Power-On when the power spikes over 3&#xd7; normal, it samples more quickly to get all the time domain and frequency domain parameters. There is a supercap onboard the PeakPower Commander module to save energy for the Power-On cycle to sample at 100 Hz or higher, immediately when a non-zero transition is detected using an analog comparator.</p>
