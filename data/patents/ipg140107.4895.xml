<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Optical transport systems typically modulate a data signal on light to form an optical signal, and transmit the optical signal on an optical fiber. One type of optical transport system is a wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) system that multiplexes multiple optical signals on a single optical fiber using different wavelengths of light. Currently, the most expensive components, in optical transport systems, include the optical-electrical-optical (O-E-O) components, such as the lasers.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">According to one implementation, a facility may include a laser bank, a multiplexer, a splitter, and a group of optical transport systems. The laser bank may include a group of lasers that output light at a number of different, fixed wavelengths. The multiplexer may connect to the laser bank. The multiplexer may receive the light, at the different, fixed wavelengths, output by the lasers, multiplex the light to form multiplexed light, and output the multiplexed light. The splitter may receive the multiplexed light, and split the multiplexed light into instances of multiplexed light. Each of the optical transport systems may receive one of the instances of multiplexed light, demultiplex the one of the instances of multiplexed light to recover the light, modulate a data signal on the recovered light to obtain an optical signal, and transmit the optical signal on an optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to another implementation, a facility may include a first laser bank that includes a first group of lasers; a second laser bank that includes a second group of lasers; a first multiplexer connected to the first laser bank; a second multiplexer connected to the second laser bank; a first amplifier connected to the first multiplexer; a second amplifier connected to the second multiplexer; a combiner connected to the first amplifier and the second amplifier; a splitter connected to the combiner; and a group of optical transport systems connected to the splitter.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to yet another implementation, a facility may include a first laser bank that includes a first group of lasers; a second laser bank that includes a second group of lasers; a first multiplexer connected to the first laser bank; a second multiplexer connected to the second laser bank; a first amplifier connected to the first multiplexer; a second amplifier connected to the second multiplexer; a first splitter connected to the first amplifier; a second splitter connected to the second amplifier; and a group of optical transport systems connected to the first splitter and the second splitter.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to a further implementation, one or more systems may include a laser system that includes a group of lasers that emit light at different, fixed wavelengths; and a group of optical transport systems that connect to the laser system, where each of the optical transport systems may modulate data signals onto the light from the laser system to create optical signals and transmit the optical signals on one or more optical fibers.</p>

A multiplexer <b>310</b> includes a device that receives optical signals of different wavelengths and multiplexes the optical signals onto a single optical fiber, as multiplexed optical signals. This technique, of multiplexing multiple optical signals onto a single optical fiber using lasers that transmit light at different wavelengths, is commonly referred to as wavelength-division multiplexing.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A basic problem faced by optical transport systems, such as optical transport system <b>100</b>, is how to get more transport bandwidth on an optical fiber. An optical fiber may be used to transmit an optical signal over a certain distance (e.g., local area (&#x3c;500 m), metro (10 km-100 km), regional (600 km-800 km), and wide area (1,600 km-2,000 km)). As the distance of transmission increases, the more important it is to use lasers that are very narrow (i.e., very precise) in transmission bandwidth and that are cooled to within fine tolerances (e.g., within a few fractions of a degree Celsius). These narrow bandwidth lasers are very expensive. In a typical optical transport system, the cost of the optical-electrical-optical components may constitute over half of the cost of the optical transport system due to, among other things: (1) having to package the components of a transceiver including a separate laser per transceiver, (2) the cost of the lasers, and (3) having to cool the lasers to within fine tolerances.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Implementations, described herein, may remove the lasers from the transceivers and replace them with a single laser bank that can be used by all of the transceivers. As a result, better, more expensive lasers can be used and the cost of the lasers can be amortized.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Tunable lasers <b>540</b> may include a pool of tunable lasers that are normally turned off and turned on when needed.

In another implementation, each of tunable lasers <b>560</b> may be controlled to operate at any wavelength, whether within or outside of the C-band of wavelengths. A first group of lasers, of tunable lasers <b>560</b>, may be set to particular wavelengths (e.g., N different wavelengths), and a second group of lasers, of tunable lasers <b>560</b>, may be used in case of a failure of a laser in the first group. For example, the pool of tunable lasers may include M tunable lasers that can operate in N different wavelengths (where M&#x3e;N). Thus, the pool of tunable lasers may include M-N spare lasers. A spare laser, in the second group of lasers, may be used to replace a failed laser in the first group of lasers. In other words, if a laser, in the first group of lasers, fails, one of the spare lasers, in the second group of lasers, can be turned on and tuned to the wavelength of the failed laser, and can thereafter replace the failed laser.

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Amplifier <b>415</b> may include an optical amplifier that amplifies light. For example, amplifier <b>415</b> may receive the multiplexed light and amplify the multiplexed light by a particular amount. Assume, for example, that splitter <b>420</b> is a 1:F splitter, the amount of loss incurred due to the splitting may be {&#x2212;3*Log<sub>2 </sub>F} dB. Thus, in this example, amplifier <b>415</b> may amplify the multiplexed light by {3*Log<sub>2 </sub>F} dB. Therefore, if F equals 32, then the amount of loss incurred due to the splitting may be &#x2212;15 db and, thus, amplifier <b>415</b> may amplify the multiplexed light by 15 db to offset the loss incurred by the splitting. Loss may also occur at each coupling of fibers. The coupling loss may be on the order of &#x2212;1 dB. Amplifier <b>415</b> may also take into account this coupling loss. In some instances, the laser power less the loss offsets might be much higher (or lower) than a minimum receiver threshold (e.g., the minimum amount of laser power required by the receiver). In such cases, the power amplification requirements, of amplifier <b>415</b>, can be lower (or higher) or not required at all.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Splitter <b>420</b> may include an optical splitter that receives light on an input optical fiber and splits the light evenly among a set of output optical fibers. For example, splitter <b>420</b> may receive the multiplexed light from amplifier <b>415</b> and split the multiplexed light onto a set of optical fibers. In one implementation, splitter <b>420</b> may split the multiplexed light by the quantity of fibers (e.g., 1:F splitter). In another implementation, splitter <b>420</b> may split the multiplexed light by one plus the quantity of fibers (e.g., 1:(1+F) splitter). In yet another implementation, splitter <b>420</b> may split the multiplexed light by some subset of the quantity of fibers (e.g., one split for each group of G fibers (where G&#x3e;1)).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Power detector <b>425</b> may include a device that monitors the power level of the light output by a laser and outputs a control signal when the power level falls below a particular threshold. For example, power detector <b>425</b> may monitor the power of the light output by each of the lasers of laser bank <b>405</b> to determine whether the power level of any of the lasers falls below the particular threshold. When the power level of a particular fixed laser <b>520</b> falls below the particular threshold, power detector <b>425</b> may output a control signal, to laser bank <b>405</b>, instructing laser bank <b>405</b> to swap one of tunable lasers <b>540</b> for a particular fixed laser <b>520</b>. As explained above, this swapping can occur very quickly, such as in less than a millisecond. In one implementation, the control signal may include an identifier for the particular fixed laser <b>520</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Transmitter <b>435</b> may include a collection of components to facilitate the transmission of an optical signal. In one implementation, there may be a separate transmitter <b>435</b> per wavelength and per optical fiber.

Rather, the laser has been relocated to laser bank <b>405</b>. Thus, rather than requiring N*F separate lasers, facility <b>400</b> includes N separate lasers that are reused.

As described above, laser bank <b>405</b> may include N fixed lasers <b>520</b>, with each fixed laser <b>520</b> outputting light at a different wavelength. If all of fixed lasers <b>520</b> are operational, then tunable lasers <b>540</b> may be turned off at this time. If one or more of fixed lasers <b>520</b> have previously failed, then these one or more fixed lasers <b>520</b> may have been replaced with tunable lasers <b>540</b>, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The light may be multiplexed (block <b>720</b>). For example, multiplexer <b>410</b> may receive the light outputted by laser bank <b>405</b>, multiplex the light to create multiplexed light, and output the multiplexed light on a common optical fiber.

The extra split may be used by power detector <b>425</b> to detect a failed fixed laser <b>520</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In yet another implementation, splitter <b>420</b> may split the multiplexed light for each of a number of subsets of the optical fibers output from facility <b>400</b>.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In a further implementation, splitter <b>420</b> may split the multiplexed light for each of a number of subsets of the optical fibers, output from facility <b>400</b>, plus one.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">For each split of the multiplexed light, blocks <b>750</b> through <b>780</b> may be performed. For example, the multiplexed light may be demultiplexed (block <b>750</b>).

As described above, the multiplexed light may contain N different wavelengths of light. Demultiplexer <b>430</b> may separate each of the N different wavelengths of light and output each of the N different wavelengths of light on a separate optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A data signal may be modulated on the light to form an optical signal (block <b>760</b>). For example, a modulator <b>630</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) may receive a data signal from electrical processor <b>610</b>, as described above. Modulator <b>630</b> may also receive light, of a particular wavelength, from demultiplexer <b>430</b>, and modulate the data signal on the light to form an optical signal. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, each wavelength of light may be separately modulated for each of the different optical fibers output from facility <b>400</b>. In other words, if there are N different wavelengths and F different optical fibers, then N*F modulators <b>630</b> would produce N*F optical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The optical signals may be multiplexed and transmitted on an optical fiber (blocks <b>770</b> and <b>780</b>).

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">An implementation, described herein, may amortize the cost of expensive optical components, such as lasers, to reduce the overall cost of the facility. Rather than including a separate laser in each transmitter of an optical fiber interface, the lasers may be included in a laser bank that permits the light to be used by all of the transmitters. Because the lasers are being reused, more expensive lasers can be used while still reducing the overall cost of the facility. The lasers may be constructed to be very precise, which permits the lasers to transmit at longer distances.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Also, the relative frequency of the lasers, with respect to one another, may be locked/fixed. The lasers may be packaged so that the lasers are all at the same approximate temperature (e.g., within a fraction of a degree Celsius), which lets the lasers drift together. The lasers may be packaged tightly (e.g., more tightly than 50 GHz), which permits more wavelengths to be used in the C-band. As a result, more bandwidth may be used on a single optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Power reduction may also be achieved over systems that include separate lasers in the transmitters of the optical fiber interfaces. Lasers have to operate at controlled temperatures; otherwise, lasers fail. By placing the lasers on the same substrate in a laser bank, the temperature of the lasers can be more easily controlled over lasers placed close to the optical fiber interfaces. Power reduction can be achieved by eliminating the need for separate temperature control systems, and facilitating temperature control of the lasers in the laser bank.</p>
