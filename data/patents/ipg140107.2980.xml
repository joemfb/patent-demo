<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to krill oil and a method for manufacturing the krill oil, more particularly, to a method for manufacturing krill oil from krill using proteases and ultra-high pressure reactor and krill oil manufactured by the method.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Antarctic krill (<i>E. superba</i>) belonging to krill are estimated to have 2 billion tons of inhabitation amount and 30 million tons of fair catch and the world pays attention to the use and development of the krill. The krill as the main prey of marine animals including whales are located in the lowest in the food chain in the Antarctic Ocean and are less polluted, so the krill are very useful in food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The krill include nutritionally good quality of protein and lipids. The fresh krill include up to about 10% of lipids. The lipids of the krill include about 40% of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which are omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids and about 40&#x2dc;50% of phospholipids. Also, the krill include astaxanthin that is antioxidant of fat soluble carotenoids.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Organic solvent extraction method and supercritical extraction method are used as methods for extracting the lipids, which have high nutritional value, from the krill. The organic solvent extraction method needs a large amount of organic solvent as well as a lot of time for extraction. In addition, when the organic solvent extraction method is used, the organic solvent may not be entirely removed and still remain in krill oil, and wastewater may be produced by the organic solvent. For the supercritical extraction method, supercritical equipment is too expensive and difficult to operate.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to some embodiments, the present disclosure provides a method for manufacturing krill oil at low cost. Manufacturing cost can be reduced by extracting effective ingredients of krill not using expensive supercritical equipment and manufacturing krill oil.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to some embodiments, the present disclosure also provides a method for manufacturing krill oil eco-friendly. The krill oil can be manufactured by extracting the effective ingredients of the krill eco-friendly not using toxic organic solvents such as acetone, hexane, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, the present disclosure provides krill oil manufactured using the above method.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to some embodiments, the present disclosure provides a method for manufacturing krill oil comprising preparing krill, adding protease to the krill and performing enzyme reaction, extracting eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, phospholipids, and astaxanthin from the krill after performing the enzyme reaction, and mixing the extracted eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, phospholipids, and astaxanthin. The protease may comprise one or more chosen from serine alkaline proteases and metallo neutral proteases. The serine alkaline proteases may comprise proteases separated from <i>Bacillus licheniformis </i>and the metallo neutral proteases may comprise proteases separated from <i>Bacillus subtillis </i>and <i>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. </i></p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The enzyme reaction may be performed in an ultra-high pressure reactor. In the ultra-high pressure reactor, reaction pressure is 10&#x2dc;300 MPa, reaction temperature is 50&#x2dc;60&#xb0; C., and reaction time is 3&#x2dc;24 hours. In the ultra-high pressure reactor, the krill including the protease are liquefied.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">After performing the enzyme reaction, the pH of the liquefied krill may be adjusted to be 3.0&#x2dc;5.0.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">After performing the enzyme reaction, the liquefied krill may be filtered to be separated as filtrate and sludge, the eicosapentaenoic acid, the docosahexaenoic acid, and the phospholipids may be extracted by centrifugation of the filtrate, and the astaxanthin may be extracted by cleaning the sludge with ethanol.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Hereinafter, a detailed description will be given of embodiments of the present invention. The present invention is not limited to these embodiments and may be embodied in the other forms. The embodiments of the present invention are provided so that thorough and complete contents are ensured and the spirit of the invention is sufficiently transferred to a person having ordinary knowledge in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a process for manufacturing krill oil according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, frozen or freeze-dried krill are thawed and salt is removed from the krill by washing. The krill are pulverized. The krill may be pulverized as a size of about 0.5 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Protease is added to the pulverized krill. The protease and the krill may be mixed and stirred for 30 min&#x2dc;1 hr. The protease may comprise one or more chosen from serine alkaline proteases and metallo neutral proteases. The serine alkaline proteases may comprise proteases separated from <i>Bacillus licheniformis</i>. The metallo neutral proteases may comprise proteases separated from <i>Bacillus subtillis </i>and <i>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</i>. The present inventors have conducted many experiments using various proteases and have found that lipids, phospholipids, and astaxanthin can be effectively extracted from krill by the serine alkaline proteases separated from <i>Bacillus licheniformis </i>and/or the metallo neutral proteases separated from <i>Bacillus subtillis </i>and <i>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. </i></p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The protease may be added in an amount of 0.1&#x2dc;3.0 parts by weight parts per 100 parts by weight of the krill. In case where an addition amount of the protease is less than 0.1 parts by weight, the amount of the protease is too low compared to the amount of protein of the krill, so enzyme reaction may be delayed or hydrolysis of the protein may be incomplete. In case where an addition amount of the protease is more than 3.0 parts by weight, the hydrolysis of the protein may be fast but the protease is added than necessary compared to the amount of the protein so over-use of the protease may have a bad influence on flavor of the krill and manufacturing costs may increase.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">After adding the protease to the krill, the pH of the krill may be adjusted to be 7.5&#x2dc;9.0. The protease may be activated in the range of the above pH.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Enzyme reaction is performed in the krill. Protein of the krill can be hydrolyzed by the enzyme reaction. The enzyme reaction may be performed in an ultra-high pressure reactor. In the ultra-high pressure reactor, the reactor pressure may be 30&#x2dc;300 MPa, the reactor temperature may be 50&#x2dc;60&#xb0; C., and the reaction time may be 3&#x2dc;24 hours. In the ultra-high pressure reactor, the krill can be liquefied and the enzyme reaction can be performed in the liquefied krill.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">After performing the enzyme reaction, the pH of the liquefied krill may be adjusted to be 3.0&#x2dc;5.0. The pH can be adjusted by adding 2&#x2dc;4 parts by weight of citric acid and/or ascorbic acid per 100 parts by weight of the krill and letting the krill be stationary for 30 min&#x2dc;1 hr. A mixture of water and amino acids formed by the hydrolysis of the protein and lipids can be separated each other by adjusting the pH.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">After performing the enzyme reaction, the liquefied krill are filtered to be separated as filtrate and sludge.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The filtrate is filtered using 100 and 200 mesh sieve and the sludge including the shell of the krill and so on can be separated.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The filtrate is centrifuged and lipids and phospholipids can be extracted. The lipids may comprise eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The centrifugation speed may be 3000&#x2dc;13000 rpm. The amino acids and peptides can be collected from the filtrate by the centrifugation. Krill extract can be manufactured by decompressing and concentrating the amino acids and the peptides.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The sludge is cleaned with 95% ethanol and astaxanthin can be extracted. The ethanol may be added in the amount of 200&#x2dc;300 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the sludge.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Krill oil can be manufactured by mixing the lipids, the phospholipids and the astaxanthin and by decompressing and concentrating them. The ethanol can be collected and the water can be removed in the decompressing and concentrating process. The temperature in the decompressing and concentrating process may be 45&#x2dc;65&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a process for manufacturing krill oil according to other embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the enzyme reaction may be performed in a conventional reactor rather than the ultra-high pressure reactor.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Examples 1 to 4</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Krill samples were prepared by pulverizing frozen krill with a mixer. Distilled water and proteases were added to the krill samples. The krill samples were hydrolyzed at the ultra-high pressure of 30, 50, 70, and 100 MPa and at the temperature of 55&#xb0; C. and were liquefied. Mixed liquid of serine alkaline proteases separated from <i>Bacillus licheniformis </i>and metallo neutral proteases separated from <i>Bacillus subtillis </i>and <i>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens </i>was used as the above proteases. The serine alkaline proteases and the metallo neutral proteases may be separated by low-temperature water extraction method.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The distilled water was added in the amount of 100 parts by weight and the proteases were added in the amount of 1 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the krill.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">After performing the hydrolyzation, the hydrolyzed and liquefied products were filtered to be separated as filtrate and sludge. The filtrate was centrifuged and lipids and phospholipids were extracted. The sludge was cleaned with ethanol and astaxanthin was extracted. Krill oil was manufactured by mixing the lipids, the phospholipids and the astaxanthin and by decompressing and concentrating them. The recovery ratios of the lipids are shown in Table 2 below.</p>
