<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In polarizing plates, which are assembled into display devices such as liquid crystal displays (LCD), and optical films, which are assembled into plasma displays (PDP), their outermost surfaces undergo a hard coat treatment to prevent damage, stains, etc., and as materials to be treated, materials with low surface energy or polarity are used. In addition, in PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) layer-protecting films that have recently been used in polarizing plates, triacetyl cellulose films have been replaced by norbornene resin films having low polarity.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For these reasons, in the case where optical films such as polarizing plates were pasted on display panels, conventional pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes had deficient adhesion reliability and caused problems in durability. As the usage of liquid crystal display devices becomes wider, they are used in various environments, and a high degree of adhesiveness, which does not cause peeling-off, is also in demand for pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes for pasting constitutional parts. In addition, high transparency is also required for the pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes so that the visibility of display panels is not lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In Patent Documents 1 and 2, pressure-sensitive adhesive sheets (pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes) that are used for pasting optical members are presented. However, in pressure-sensitive adhesive compositions containing a lot of carboxyl groups, there has been a problem that adhesiveness becomes lowered with respect to an adherend having low polarity.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, as a method for raising the adhesiveness to the adherend having low polarity, a method in which a tackifying resin (tackifier) is added to the pressure-sensitive adhesive compositions has been known. In Patent Documents 3 and 4, acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive compositions, in which a rosin or hydrogenated tackifying resin is added as a tackifying resin to acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive compositions, are presented. However, there still has been a case where the improvement of the adhesiveness to the adherend having low polarity could not be sufficiently achieved.

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="tail"?>
<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0027">An optical acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition according to one embodiment of the invention contains 100 parts by mass of an acrylic polymer (A) which includes a vinylic monomer having a nitrogen atom in the skeleton as a monomer unit and does not substantially include a monomer containing a carboxyl group; 1-70 parts by mass of a (meth)acrylic polymer (B) having a weight average molecular weight of 1,000 or greater and less than 30,000; and 1-50 parts by mass of a hydrogenated tackifying resin (C).</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">(Acrylic Polymer (A))</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0028">The acrylic polymer (A) is a polymer that contains a vinylic monomer having a nitrogen atom in the skeleton thereof as a monomer unit and does not substantially contain a monomer containing a carboxyl group (carboxyl group-containing monomer). The optical acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition according to this embodiment of the invention includes a vinylic monomer having a nitrogen atom in the skeleton as a monomer unit in the acrylic polymer (A), thereby rendering appropriate polarity to the acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition. In addition, a monomer containing a carboxyl group is not substantially contained in the acrylic polymer (A), thereby preventing the polarity of the acrylic polymer (A) from being excessively raised. As a result, the affinity of the acrylic polymer (A) and the (meth)acrylic polymer (B) having low to intermediate polarity can be improved. Consequently, the adhesiveness of the optical acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive tape to an adherend can be improved, and the transparency of the optical acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive tape can be heightened.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0029">Here, the aforementioned &#x201c;monomer containing a carboxyl group (carboxyl group-containing monomer)&#x201d; indicates a vinyl monomer (ethylenic unsaturated monomer) having at least one carboxyl group in one molecule (which can be a form of anhydride). As specific examples of the monomer containing a carboxyl group, ethylenic unsaturated monocarboxylic acids such as (meth)acrylic acid and crotonic acid; ethylenic unsaturated dicarboxylic acids such as maleic acid, itaconic acid, and citraconic acid; and anhydrides of ethylenic unsaturated dicarboxylic acids such as maleic anhydride and itaconic anhydride may be mentioned. In addition, the aforementioned term &#x201c;not substantially contain (include)&#x201d;, for example, means that the acrylic polymer (A) does not contain a monomer containing a carboxyl group at all or the content of the monomer containing a carboxyl group is 0.1 mass % or less of all the monomer components. The aforementioned term &#x201c;not substantially contain (include)&#x201d;, for example, means that the carboxyl group contained in the acrylic polymer (A) is 0.0014 mol/g equivalent or less.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0030">In the acrylic polymer (A), preferably, not only is the monomer containing a carboxyl group not substantially contained, but monomers containing acidic groups (sulfonic acid groups, phosphoric acid groups, etc.) other than the carboxyl group are not substantially contained. In other words, preferably, a monomer containing a carboxyl group and other monomers containing acidic groups is not contained at all, or the total amount thereof is 0.1 mass % or less of all the monomer components, or the total amount of the carboxyl group and the other acid groups contained in the acrylic polymer (A) is 0.0014 mol/g equivalent or less.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0031">In addition, the acrylic polymer (A), for example, may be a copolymer in which a vinylic monomer having a nitrogen atom in the skeleton thereof and a (meth)acrylic acid ester represented by the following general formula (1) have been copolymerized as essential components.
<br/>

</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0032">(In the formula (1), R<sup>1 </sup>represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, and R<sup>2 </sup>represents an alkyl group with 1-12 carbon atoms or an alicyclic hydrocarbon group.)</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0033">The acrylic polymer (A) can be obtained by polymerizing (for example, solution polymerization, emulsion polymerization, and UV polymerization) the vinylic monomer and the (meth)acrylic acid ester along with a polymerization initiator. Here, the aforementioned term &#x201c;copolymerized as essential components&#x201d; means that the total amount of the aforementioned vinylic monomer and the aforementioned (meth)acrylic acid ester is about 50 mass % or more of the total amount of monomer components constituting the acrylic polymer (A). The total amount of the aforementioned vinylic monomer and the aforementioned (meth)acrylic acid ester is for example about 50-100 mass %, preferably about 50-99.9 mass %, more preferably about 60-95 mass %, and still more preferably about 70-85 mass %.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0034">Moreover, the aforementioned vinyl monomer is preferably one kind or two kinds or more of monomers selected from the group consisting of N-vinyl cyclic amides represented by the following general formula (2) and (meth)acrylamides.

<p id="p-0032" num="0035">(In the formula (2), R<sup>3 </sup>represents a divalent organic group.)</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0068">In addition, in the (meth)acrylic polymer (B), acrylic monomers having a relatively bulky structure, which are represented by (meth)acrylates having an alkyl group with a branch structure such as t-butyl (meth)acrylate, esters of (meth)acrylic acid with alicyclic alcohol, such as cyclohexyl (meth)acrylate and isobornyl (meth)acrylate, and aryl (meth)acrylates such as phenyl (meth)acrylate and benzyl (meth)acrylate, etc., are preferably contained as a monomer unit. By rendering this bulky structure to the (meth)acrylic polymer (B), the adhesiveness of the acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition can be further improved. In particular, the adhesiveness to an adherend with low polarity can be more markedly improved. Moreover, where UV polymerization is adopted for the synthesis of the (meth)acrylic polymer (B), the (meth)acrylate having an alkyl group with a branch structure or the ester of (meth)acylic acid with alicyclic alcohol can be appropriately used as a monomer constituting the (meth)acrylic polymer (B) in terms that it hardly inhibit the polymerization.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0069">Furthermore, a functional group having reactivity with an epoxy group or isocyanate group may be introduced into the (meth)acrylic polymer (B). As examples of such functional group, hydroxyl group, carboxyl group, amino group, amide group, and mercapto group can be mentioned, and a monomer containing such functional group is preferably used in preparing the (meth)acrylic polymer (B).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0070">The weight average molecular weight of the (meth)acrylic polymer (B) is 1,000 or greater and less than 30,000, preferably 1,500 or greater and less than 20,000, and more preferably 2,000 or greater and less than 10,000. If the weight average molecular weight thereof is 30,000 or greater, sufficient improvement effect on the adhesive strength in the pressure-sensitive adhesive tape cannot sometimes be obtained. On the other hand, if the weight average molecular weight thereof is less than 1,000, since the molecular weight is low, the adhesive strength and the adhesion property of the pressure-sensitive adhesive tape may sometimes be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0071">The weight average molecular weight can be measured in terms of polystyrene (polystyrene conversion) in accordance with GPC method. Specifically, the weight average molecular weight is measured with the HPLC8020 made by Tosoh Corporation under the conditions of a flow velocity of tetrahydrofuran solvent of about 0.5 mL/min, and using 2 pieces of TSKgel GMH-H (20) as columns.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0072">The content of the (meth)acrylic polymer (B) is 1-70 parts by mass, preferably 3-60 parts by mass, and more preferably 5-50 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the acrylic polymer (A). If the (meth)acrylic polymer (B) is added at more than 70 parts by mass, the elastic modulus of the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer formed of the acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition in this embodiment is raised, sometimes impairing the adhesive performance at low temperature or not exerting an adhesive strength even at room temperature. On the other hand, if the amount to be added is less than 1 part by mass, the effect cannot sometimes be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0073">The (meth)acrylic polymer (B) preferably has a glass transition temperature (Tg) of about 0-300&#xb0; C., more preferably about 20-300&#xb0; C., and further preferably about 20-200&#xb0; C. If the glass transition temperature (Tg) is lower than about 0&#xb0; C., the cohesive strength of the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer at room temperature or higher is lowered, and the adhesion performance at high-temperature is sometime lowered. In this embodiment, the glass transition temperatures of representative materials usable as the (meth)acrylic polymer (B) are shown in Table 1. The glass transition temperatures of the (meth)acrylic polymer (B) are nominal values described in publications, catalogues, etc., or values calculated based on the following equation (3) (Fox equation).

</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0074">(In the equation (3), Tg represents the glass transition temperature (unit: K) of the (meth)acrylic polymer (B), Tgi (i=1, 2, . . . , and n) represents the glass transition temperature (unit: K) when a monomer i forms a homopolymer, and Wi (i=1, 2, . . . , and n) represents the mass fraction of the monomer i in the whole monomer components.)</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0075">The aforementioned equation (3) is the calculation expression in the case where the (meth)acrylic polymer (B) is composed of n kinds of monomer components of monomer 1, monomer 2, . . . , and monomer n.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0086">Preferable examples of the (meth)acrylic polymer (B) explained above are summarized as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0087">(1) The glass transition temperature of the (meth)acrylic polymer (B) is preferably 0-300&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0088">(2) The (meth)acrylic polymer (B) preferably contains a (meth)acrylic monomer having an alicyclic structure, such as cyclohexyl (meth)acrylate, isobornyl (meth)acrylate, and dicyclopentanyl (meth)acrylate, as a monomer unit.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">&#x3c;Method for Preparing the (Meth)Acrylic Polymer (B)&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0089">The (meth)acrylic polymer (B), for example, can be prepared by polymerizing the (meth)acrylic monomer having the aforementioned structure according to a solution polymerization method, bulk polymerization method, emulsion polymerization method, suspension polymerization, bulk polymerization, etc.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">&#x3c;Method for Adjusting the Molecular Weight of the (Meth)Acrylic Polymer (B)&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0090">To adjust the molecular weight of the (meth)acrylic polymer (B), a chain transfer agent can be used during its polymerization. As examples of the chain transfer agent for use, compounds having a mercapto group such as octylmercaptan, cyclohexylmercaptan, dodecylmercaptan, t-dodecylmercaptan, and mercaptoethanol; and thioglycerol, thioglycolic acid, methyl thioglycolate, ethyl thioglycolate, propyl thioglycolate, butyl thioglycolate, t-butyl thioglycolate, 2-ethylhexyl thioglycolate, octyl thioglycolate, isooctyl thioglycolate, decyl thioglycolate, dodecyl thioglycolate, thioglycolic acid ester of ethylene glycol, thioglycolic acid ester of neopentyl glycol, and thioglycolic acid ester of pentaerythritol are mentioned.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0091">Although the amount of the chain transfer agent used is not particularly limited, the chain transfer agent is included in a range of usually about 0.1-20 parts by mass, preferably about 0.2-15 parts by mass, and more preferably about 0.3-10 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the (meth)acrylic monomer. With this adjustment of the amount of addition of the chain transfer agent, the (meth)acrylic polymer (B) with an appropriate molecular weight can be obtained. Here, the chain transfer agents can be used alone or in combination of two kinds or more thereof.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">(Hydrogenated Tackifying Resin (C))</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0092">The hydrogenated tackifying resin (C) is a resin other than rosin-based resins. Specifically, it can be selected from derivatives hydrogenated into tackifying resins such as petroleum-based resins, terpene-based resins, chroman-indene-based resins, styrene-based resins, alkyl phenol resins, and xylene resins. For example, the hydrogenated petroleum-based resin can be selected from aromatic ones, dicyclopentadiene-based ones, aliphatic ones, aromatic monomer-dicyclopentadiene copolymerized-type ones, etc. In addition, the hydrogenated terpene-based resin can be selected from terpene phenol resins, aromatic terpene resins, etc. Among them, a hydrogenated petroleum-based resin and a hydrogenated terpene-based resin are especially preferably used.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0093">The softening point of the hydrogenated tackifying resin (C) is preferably 80-200&#xb0; C., more preferably 100-200&#xb0; C. By setting the softening point of the hydrogenated tackifying resin (C) to such a range, a high cohesive strength can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0094">As mentioned above, the content of the hydrogenated tackifying resin (C) is 1-50 parts by mass, preferably 2-40 parts by mass, and more preferably 3-30 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the acrylic polymer (A). If the amount of addition of the hydrogenated tackifying resin (C) is more than 50 parts by mass, the transparency or cohesive strength is sometimes lowered. On the other hand, if the amount of addition of the hydrogenated tackifying resin (C) is less than 1 part by mass, sometimes the improvement effect on the adhesive strength cannot be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0095">The mixture amounts of the (meth)acrylic polymer (B) (oligomer) and the hydrogenated tackifying resin (C) are such that the ratio (meth)acrylic polymer (B)/hydrogenated tackifying resin (C) is 1.0/0.1-2.0, preferably 1.0/0.2-1.5, and more preferably 1.0/0.3-1.0 (all of these are the mass ratio). If the amount of mixture of both of these components is within this range, the transparency and the adhesion reliability are improved. The reason for this is presumed to be that the (meth)acrylic polymer (B) acts as a compatibilizer of the hydrogenated tackifying resin and both of them are uniformly dispersed, thereby improving the transparency and the adhesion reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0096">The acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition of this embodiment includes the aforementioned acrylic polymer (A), (meth)acrylic polymer (B), and hydrogenated tackifying resin (C) as its essential components and can include various kinds of general additives in the field of pressure-sensitive adhesive compositions as optional component(s). As these optional components, plasticizers, softening agents, fillers, colorants (pigments, dyes, etc.), antioxidants, leveling agents, stabilizers, antiseptics, etc., are mentioned. As these additives, conventional well-known additives can be used according to ordinary methods.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0097">Next, the structure of the optical acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive tape (or optical acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet) including a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer containing the optical acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition with the aforementioned composition will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0098">The optical acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive tape in this embodiment is provided with a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer containing the optical acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition. The optical acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive tape may be a so-called pressure-sensitive adhesive tape with a substrate, in which a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer is fixed on one surface or both surfaces of a sheet-shaped substrate (support), that is, without intending the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer to separate from the substrate, or a so-called pressure-sensitive adhesive tape without a substrate, in which the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer is provided on a substrate with a peel-off property such as a peel-off liner (peel-off paper, resin sheet whose surface has been subjected to a peel-off treatment, etc.) and the substrate for supporting the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer is removed at the time of pasting. Here, the concept of the pressure-sensitive adhesive tape can include pressure-sensitive adhesive sheets, pressure-sensitive adhesive labels, pressure-sensitive adhesive films, etc. In addition, the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer is not limited to a continuously formed pressure-sensitive adhesive layer but may be a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer formed with a regular or random pattern such as a dotted shape and stripe shape.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0099">As the aforementioned substrate, for example, plastic film, for example, polyester film such as polypropylene film, ethylene-propylene copolymer film, polyethylene terephthalate film, and polyethylene naphthalate film, and polyvinyl chloride film; foam substrate such as polyurethane foam and polyethylene foam; paper such as kraft paper, crepe paper, and Japanese paper; cloth such as cotton cloth and spun rayon; nonwoven fabric such as nonwoven polyester fabric and nonwoven vinylon fabric; metal foil such as aluminum foil and copper foil; and the like can be appropriately selected and used according to the applications of the pressure-sensitive adhesive tape. As the aforementioned plastic film, any of the unstretched films and stretched (uniaxially stretched or biaxially stretched) films can be used. In addition, the surface of the substrate on which the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer is to be provided may be subjected to a surface treatment such as spreading of an undercoat agent and corona discharge treatment. The thickness of the substrate can be appropriately selected in accordance with the purpose and is generally about 10-500 (typically, 10-200 &#x3bc;m).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0100">The pressure-sensitive adhesive layer can be a cured layer of the optical acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition. In other words, the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer can be formed by appropriately applying a curing treatment after rendering (for example, spreading) the optical acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition onto an appropriate substrate. In the case where two or more kinds of curing treatments (drying, crosslinking, polymerizing, etc.) are carried out, these treatments can be carried out simultaneously or inmultiple steps. With the pressure-sensitive adhesive composition using a partially polymerized product (acrylic polymer syrup), the final copolymerization reaction is typically carried out as the aforementioned curing treatment (the partially polymerized product is subjected to a further copolymerization reaction to form a completely polymerized product). For example, for a photocurable pressure-sensitive adhesive composition, it is irradiated with light. If necessary, a curing treatment such as crosslinking and drying may also be applied. For example, in the case where the photocurable pressure-sensitive adhesive composition is required to be dried, photocuring may be carried out after drying. For the pressure-sensitive adhesive composition using the completely polymerized product, as the aforementioned curing treatment, treatments such as drying (heating drying) and crosslinking are typically carried out, if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0101">In spreading the optical acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition, for example, common coaters such as gravure roll coaters, reverse roll coaters, kiss roll coaters, dip roll coaters, bar coater, knife coaters and spray coaters can be employed. Here, for the pressure-sensitive adhesive tape with a substrate, the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer may be formed by directly rendering the pressure-sensitive adhesive composition onto the substrate, or the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer formed on a peel-off liner may be transferred to the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0102">Although the thickness of the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer is not particularly limited, for example, when the thickness is usually about 10 &#x3bc;m or greater, preferably about 15 &#x3bc;m or greater, and more preferably about 20 &#x3bc;m or greater, a good adhesive performance can be realized. For example, the thickness of the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer is appropriately about 10-250 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0103">The optical acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive tape in this embodiment is appropriately used in the application, for example, of pasting of various kinds of display panel members such as polarizing plates whose outermost surface has undergone a hard coat treatment and glass substrates. As the method for forming the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer on various kinds of members, a direct rendering method or transfer method can be appropriately employed. Typically, the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer formed on the peel-off liner is transferred to the base surface of the members.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0104">As explained above, the optical acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition in this embodiment contains 100 parts by mass of an acrylic polymer (A) which contains a vinylic monomer having a nitrogen atom in the skeleton as a monomer unit and does not substantially contain a monomer containing a carboxyl group; 1-70 parts by mass of a (meth)acrylic polymer (B) with a weight average molecular weight of 1,000 or greater and less than 30,000; and 1-50 parts by mass of a hydrogenated tackifying resin (C). In this way, high transparency and high adhesion can be provided to the optical acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0105">The reason why the adhesiveness of the acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive tape to an adherend with low polarity is improved is presumed to be that the (meth)acrylic polymer (B) is compatible with the hydrogenated tackifying resin (C) and also compatible with the acrylic polymer (A). In other words, the reason for this is presumed to be that the (meth)acrylic polymer (B) acts a compatibilizer of the hydrogenated tackifying resin (C), so that both of them are uniformly dispersed, thereby improving the adhesion reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0106">Especially in the case where the (meth)acrylic polymer (B) has an alicyclic structure, it is presumed that the compatibility with the hydrogenated tackifying resin (C) is raised by the alicyclic structure, while the main chain of the (meth)acrylic polymer (B) is compatible with the acrylic polymer (A).</p>
