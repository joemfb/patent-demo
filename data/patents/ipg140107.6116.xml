<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to integrated electronic and photonic design methodologies and, more particularly, to design environments that incorporate both electronic and photonic elements.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Designers of electronic devices and components frequently employ design tools to aid them. Such computer-aided design (CAD) makes use of automated rule checking and stock component types to allow a designer to rapidly create full circuit designs that conform to the requirements of the fabrication technology to be used.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">While electronic design is well established, nanophotonic integrated circuits are an emerging domain and present design technologies are inadequate. At present, integrated electronic/photonic devices undergo two wholly separate design processes, one in the electronic domain and one in the photonic domain, and designers must iterate back and forth to resolve conflicts and malfunctions. Such methodologies, where two separate designs are merged, are highly error-prone and time-consuming. Furthermore, photonic design tools are immature and lack the flexibility of electronic design tools.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, a designer may use a layout editor environment and check electrical properties, manufacturability, and design rules using a design rule checker (DRC) that is customized for a particular manufacturing setup solely targeting electrical performance. The designer may also perform such a step for the photonic design, having its own DRC process for photonics manufacturing processes and design rules, but photonic components have needs which don't have counterparts in the electrical domain.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present principles provide a unified design environment for electronic and photonic computer-aided design (CAD). Whereas previous attempts at integrated products were after-the-fact combinations of discrete electronic and photonic units, the present principles provide for the creation of integrated electronic/photonic circuits formed on a single substrate, thereby providing significant cost and performance benefits.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">By integrating the design processes, the design environment can perform rule checking across both domains simultaneously, eliminating the tedious iterative reconciliation of two separate designs. In a typical design process, whether electronic of photonic, special layers and shapes are placed in a geometric space allocated to mask production that is used in integrated circuit manufacturing. The parameters for the layers and the shapes, including, e.g., length and width, have special-purpose meanings. For example, an RX layer is reserved for active transistor channels which make up the core of an n-type field effect transistor (NFET). It should be recognized that RX layer is used herein to refer to an electrical transistor diffusion layer. Although it is specifically contemplated that the RX layer is used, any suitable silicon mesa, on which a transistor or silicon photonic waveguide is fabricated, may be employed. For example, shallow trench isolation may be used to establish such a region. Any shape drawn on the RX layer will be printed onto an RX mask to be used within the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Electrical designs use RX shapes to form devices, typically at pre-determined lengths based on the manufacturing process being used. For example, 32 nm technologies stipulate that RX has a minimum length of 32 nm. Photonic designs use RX shapes to transfer light signals in the form of waveguides. In the photonic regime there is a much different length/width restriction for RX shapes. When extending the designs into multiple domains, the present principles use markers to indicate relevant design verification and checker tools to specify areas of importance and specialization. As a result, embodiments according to the present principles can use markers on, e.g., a waveguide RX shape, to indicate that it is a photonic design component.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present principles therefore provide the ability to differentiate between electronic and photonic RX shapes in a given design and to apply DRC rules specifically relevant to each. For example, RX shapes may be checked to ensure a minimum of 32 nm length in a given technology, but RX shapes indicated with a special &#x201c;photonic&#x201d; marker shape could be excluded from this check. Instead, such shapes would be checked against a photonics design rule, if any. In this way, embodiments according to the present principles can embody both electrical and photonics design layers and shapes with specialized marker layers to guide downstream design and verification tools.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to the drawings in which like numerals represent the same or similar elements and initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a process for integrated electronic and photonic design is shown. Block <b>102</b> uses a CAD system to create a circuit layout that includes electronic and photonic components. The design components include a distinguishing flag that allows the system to differentiate between components that will have electronic design rules applied to them, and those that will have photonic design rules applied. This may be represented as a simple bit in memory that represents the component type, and may be visually represented in a graphical user interface to permit a designer to discern the component type at a glance.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Block <b>104</b> adjusts photonic components according to the physical needs that photonic structure have. Photonic structures operate in a very different way from electronic structures and hence have specific needs. For example, whereas a transmission line in an electronic circuit may be created with hard right angles, such a structure may not be used for a photonic waveguide&#x2014;the hard angle would lead to transmission losses and may even disrupt transmission entirely. Instead, photonic waveguides use more gentle curves to preserve total internal reflection. Block <b>104</b> allows a designer to layout photonic structures in an intuitive way before automatically converting them to more physically practical shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Furthermore, when a designer lays out a photonics component, block <b>104</b> may employ a blockage layer to generate key marker layers and shapes. For example, a metal exclusion layer may be included over a photonic component to prevent downstream verification errors from adding such a metal layer or objecting to the absence of a metal layer. Blockage layer generation takes each shape in a seed layer, creates a new shape that overlaps the shapes in the seed layer, and creates a blockage layer using the overlapping shape.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Block <b>106</b> performs DRC on the layout. Electronic and photonic components will have respective sets of rules that derive from their respective fabrication technologies. Rules such as minimum spacing, minimum feature size, and minimum turn radius will be checked across all components. In once embodiment, the photonic and electronic components are considered with separate sets of rules. In an alternative embodiment, a unified ruleset is created that accommodates all components by, e.g., selecting the stricter rule from each of the electronic and photonic rulesets. For example, in a case where the minimum feature size for electronic components is larger than the minimum feature size for photonic components, the larger minimum feature size will be used in the unified ruleset. In either case, the rules may be entered manually to accommodate specific design and manufacturing considerations, or may be automatically entered using, e.g., a spreadsheet.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">If there are conflicts between components, block <b>108</b> reconciles those conflicts. Block <b>108</b> may accomplish this by notifying the designer of conflicts or by automatically adjusting the design to fit everything. Alternatively, block <b>108</b> may make an automatic attempt before notifying the user of any conflicts that are not accounted for. For example, block <b>108</b> may resize or move electronic and photonic components to resolve a conflict, performing river routing and DRC as necessary to ensure functional consistency and design rule acceptability.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A design environment according to the present principles may include a variety of features to assist in integrated electronic and photonic CAD. Such features may include, for example, a shape library toolkit that generates commonly used photonic structures with parameters and guidance from the designer. The shape toolkit may include a variety of shapes such as, e.g., different waveguide structures, couplers, modulators, etc. The shapes stored in the toolkit may be rectilinear and have a pre-defined resolution, or may be more flexibly shaped and controlled by the designer. For example, the shape toolkit may include S-bend and Mach-Zehnder interferometer shapes are typical shapes used in photonics designs.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Such a photonic shape library is distinct from, e.g., a library of parameterized cells (p-cells). Existing p-cell libraries fail to provide particular layout shapes for photonics design. A photonics shape library, such as the shape toolkit described above, is a design tool which permits the additional low-level, base functionality needed for a designer to construct a photonic p-cell. It is possible to create such a photonic p-cell by repeated function calls to elements of the shape library, for example by programming and executing a script.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a comparison of design elements representing electronic and photonic transmission paths. As noted above, while it is easy to draw and design using rectilinear structures, such as lines <b>202</b>, as is possible in the electronic domain, such structures are not adequate for photonic designs. As such, the present principles allow the use of a radial bended path maker. The radial bended path maker is a tool which transforms rectilinear paths <b>202</b> into photonics-specific radially bended form <b>204</b>. This allows the designer to work on a high level without providing detailed design information for every waveguide connection.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a method of creating radial bended paths <b>204</b> is shown. Block <b>302</b> accesses a design document that incorporates electronic and photonic elements and finds piecewise linear segments. These structures, such as the rectilinear paths <b>202</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, may be marked as being photonic structures, allowing for quick differentiation between those structures which are to become bent waveguides and those which may remain as rectilinear electronic paths.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Having located candidates for bending, block <b>304</b> builds a list of internal corners of the rectilinear path <b>202</b>. Block <b>304</b> associates each internal corner with an orientation and directionality. There are eight exemplary possibilities for such corners: north-east, south-west, north-west, south-east, east-north, east-south, west south, and west-north. These eight possibilities represent the eight rectilinear paths that can be taken from one point to another. In particular it should be recognized that there may be multiple possible paths to each point. For example, the path may go &#x201c;north&#x201d; and then &#x201c;east,&#x201d; or may instead go &#x201c;east&#x201d; and then &#x201c;north.&#x201d; This distinction is relevant because one bend may be better able to fit in a given design layout and that directionality should be preserved.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For each such corner, block <b>306</b> places a radially bended curve over the corner. It is important to note that, in many manufacturing processes, the bends may still be fundamentally rectilinear due to limitations in existing electronic manufacturing design rules. It is conventional for design rules to require that all vertices in a layout meet at right angles. However, coarse 90 degree corners are not usable in photonic bends, which use smooth arcs to promote total internal reflection. To address this, the present process allows for automatic generation of high-resolution bended shapes that approximate appropriate curves. By implementing the curve at the highest available software design resolution (e.g., 1 nm), the present principles keep the &#x201c;pixilation&#x201d; of the curve below the resolution of the manufacturing process. When the design is manufactured, the relatively coarse operation of the manufacturing technology smoothes out the rectilinear pixilation, creating a consistent curve suitable for a photonic waveguide. Block <b>308</b> then attaches adjacent corners with padded rectangle shapes, representing the width of the straight portion of the bent waveguide <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Replacing rectilinear paths <b>202</b> with radially bent paths <b>204</b> uses two parameters to make the conversion. In particular, a line width and a bend radius are used. The line width determines the width of the waveguide, while the bend radius is a measure from the center of a bend curve to the mid-point of the waveguide. These parameters may be specified manually or may be determined automatically based on physical manufacturing limitations and the materials used. For example, a waveguide made from a given material will have a minimum practical radius, below which light will begin to escape and the signal will be degraded. Such materials and their associated minimum radii may be stored in a table and automatically implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the use of radial path bending in river routing is shown. Automatic conversion to radially bent paths comes into play when performing river routing of photonic pathways. River routing allows for the rerouting of connections in a design environment when a connected element is moved. For example, if two components <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> are connected by multiple waveguides <b>406</b>, river routing automatically preserves the connections between said components. If component <b>404</b> is moved laterally (e.g., to make room for another component), all of the connections between component <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> are rerouted to produce bent pathways <b>408</b>. In an electronic system, river routing merely involves extending and shifting right-angled transmission lines as needed. In a photonic system, river routing preserves minimum radii in waveguide paths <b>408</b> and introduces new bends <b>409</b> as needed, so the radial bended path maker automatically provides adjustments to waveguide connections. It should be noted that the components in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are all photonic components, and so all include a graphical P marker <b>410</b> that distinguishes them in the design environment from electronic components.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an integrated design system <b>500</b> is shown. The system <b>500</b> includes a processor <b>502</b>, a memory <b>504</b>, and a graphical user interface (GUI) <b>506</b>. The GUI <b>506</b> may include a display and a user input device that allows a user to graphically design integrated electronic and photonic circuits. Toward this end, integrated shape toolkit <b>514</b> accesses a store of electronic and photonic shapes stored in memory <b>504</b> and allows a user to place such shapes within a virtual space.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Photonic components need special considerations that do not apply to electronic components. For example, a radial path bending module <b>510</b> automatically adjusts rectilinear waveguide paths in the manner described above. This allows a user to use basic tools to lay out waveguides, while the bending module <b>510</b> automatically converts the hard corners to more gentle bends. Additional tools include river routing module <b>512</b>. River routing module <b>512</b> employs electronic-domain river routing techniques in combination with radial path bending module <b>510</b> to allow users to easily modify photonic design layouts, automatically preserving photonically valid connections between components.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The GUI <b>506</b> further allows a user to create, store, and modify design rules for both electronic and photonic components. Design rules are stored in memory <b>504</b> and are used by DRC module <b>508</b> to ensure that the design can be manufactured according to the specific manufacturing processes in use. For example, the DRC module <b>508</b> will check to ensure that all features meet a minimum spacing and feature size according to the physical resolution of the manufacturing technology. The DRC module <b>508</b> can also use processor <b>502</b> to automatically adjust the design to correct it in places where design rules have been violated by, e.g., enlarging or moving circuit components.</p>
