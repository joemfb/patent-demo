<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to systems and methods for dispensing electrostatically atomized active materials without the use of volatile organic compounds (&#x201c;VOCs&#x201d;). More specifically, embodiments of the present invention generally relate to systems and methods for rapidly atomizing and dispersing insecticides and similar low electrical conductivity fluids without the use of propellants and other additives.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The aerosol can dispenser is a staple of modern society. Produced by the billions, the modern aerosol can is capable of dispensing, on demand, high flow-rate (gram/sec), finely aerosolized doses of a wide array of products. Despite its continued refinement and utility, the aerosol can dispenser is a fundamentally inefficient and polluting means for spray generation and transfer of active material to a target.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">By way of example, a popular, archetypical insecticidal aerosol can has a net weight of about 370 grams (13 ounces) of which the active ingredients (Pyrethrins) and &#x201c;related&#x201d; materials (including &#x201c;petroleum distillate&#x201d;) account for less than 2% of the total weight of ingredients. The remaining &#x201c;inert&#x201d; material, some 98.087%, is required for the aerosolization process. To atomize and disperse less than eight grams of active material requires in excess of 360 grams of environmentally detrimental propellant/diluent plus a costly pressure vessel and atomizing nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The aerosol can dispenser is simply a hydraulic or gas assisted nozzle. Operational pressure (of about 5 bar), consisting of hydraulic pressure, propellant vapor, or a combination of the two, mechanically and aerodynamically converts bulk fluid into a directed droplet plume. With a broad droplet size distribution characterized by a significant population of small (&#x3c;10 micron) droplets, these readily stagnated aerosols also present a respirable health hazard. This highly inefficient atomization and dispersal process is effective, but it is so at a cost. The environmental impact of the propellants dumped into the atmosphere, discarded pressure vessels, and the inhalation health hazards of repeated exposure to the spray are costs that have yet to be to be fully addressed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Well-proven direct charge injection electrostatic atomizer technology provides high instantaneous flow rates of the small volumes of active ingredients required for all applications of interest. Charged spray droplets so produced are self-dispersive, preferentially enveloping and wrapping around the target. Transfer of fluid to the target is inherently more effective than is possible using conventional aerosol dispensers. Of equal importance, the charged spray cannot form a respirable cloud. Having droplet size distributions three or more times narrower than non-charged sprays, small (&#x3c;10 microns) and large (&#x2267;100 microns) droplets are absent. All droplets are charged, attracted to the target, and cannot be inhaled.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Most importantly, modest feed pressures (less than one bar) available by hand pumping are sufficient to generate self-dispersive small droplet plumes. This capability permits the elimination of VOCs such as propellants and diluents as well as the high-pressure container previously required for atomization/dispersion. However, current manifestations of direct charge injection electrostatic atomizers are bulky and costly.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is needed is an alternative aerosolization and/or dispensing apparatus that eliminates the propellants and/or diluents inherent in aerosol can operation. It is an object of this invention to provide a disposable, hand-held, low-pressure electrostatic atomizer capable of providing the same level of low-cost, operator-friendly convenience of an aerosol can without detrimental impact on the environment or user health and in which only &#x201c;active&#x201d;, undiluted ingredients are sprayed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Disclosed is a portable apparatus for electrostatically dispensing fluid including: an activating mechanism; a high voltage generator to provide a high voltage; a power source to supply power to said high voltage generator; a disposable cartridge; a pressurizing mechanism connected to said activating mechanism to be driven thereby, said pressurizing mechanism located adjacent said disposable cartridge and in communication with a second end of said disposable cartridge for deforming and pressurizing said disposable cartridge; a housing, said housing substantially enclosing at least a portion of said activating mechanism, said high voltage generator, said power source, and said pressurizing mechanism, said housing including a first cartridge receptacle for detachably receiving said disposable cartridge; and a spray charge dissipation mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The disposable cartridge includes: a reservoir containing said fluid; a fluid output channel extending from said reservoir through an exterior wall of a first end of said disposable cartridge; and a movable orifice structure located adjacent and external to said exterior wall of said first end of said disposable cartridge, said movable orifice structure including at least one exit aperture, a conductor, and an insulator, said at least one exit aperture passing through said conductor, said conductor electrically grounded when said disposable cartridge is located in said dispensing position, said insulator positioned to cover an external end of said fluid output channel and said emitter electrode when said movable orifice structure is located in a non-dispensing position thereby isolating said emitter electrode and said fluid from an environment external to said disposable cartridge, said movable orifice structure connected to said activating mechanism to be positioned thereby relative to said channel when said disposable cartridge is located in said dispensing position; an emitter electrode including an emitter electrode tip and an emitter electrode contact, said emitter electrode contact located exterior to said disposable cartridge and said emitter electrode tip located internal to said disposable cartridge, said emitter electrode contact electrically connected to said high voltage generator for electrostatically charging said fluid when said disposable cartridge is in a dispensing position, said emitter electrode tip positioned to substantially axially align with one of said at least one exit apertures when said movable orifice structure is in said dispensing position; and an emitter electrode channel extending from said emitter electrode tip to said fluid output channel, said emitter electrode channel axially aligned with said emitter electrode tip.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Certain terminology may be used in the following description for convenience only and is not limiting. The words &#x201c;lower&#x201d; and &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and &#x201c;top&#x201d; and &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; designate directions in the drawings to which reference is made. The terminology includes the words above specifically mentioned, derivatives thereof and words of similar import.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods, constructs and materials are now described. All publications mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Where there are discrepancies in terms and definitions used in references that are incorporated by reference, the terms used in this application shall have the definitions given herein.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The objects of the present invention can be achieved by an electrostatic, self-contained fluid dispensing device which can be hand-held and hand operated and includes a disposable fluid cartridge. In addition to containing the spray fluid, each cartridge has an orifice structure and an integral direct charge injection emitter electrode to facilitate electrostatic atomization. This inexpensive atomizer is capable of providing a convenient, high, instantaneous flow-rate and controlled-dosage spray profile equivalent to that provided by an aerosol can.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The exhausted disposable plastic cartridges can reduce the eco-footprint to that of a wad of chewing gum. Residual active material is trapped in the exhausted cartridge, is doubly sealed against leakage, and is environmentally benign. The dispensing device includes a housing which encloses a power source for the electrostatic atomizer and an activating mechanism for producing pressure for the fluid cartridge and for moving an orifice structure. The housing includes a receptacle for accepting and removably holding the fluid cartridge. When placed into the receptacle, the fluid cartridge makes electrical connection with the power supply and mechanical connection with the activating mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The activating mechanism is at least partially situated within the housing to provide a sufficient amount of pressure within the fluid cartridge and adequate movement of the orifice structure when a predetermined amount of pressure and motion is applied thereto via activation of the mechanism by an operator. The mechanism is activated by the operator squeezing a handle or other mechanical lever. The replaceable cartridge is sized to provide single or multiple dosages of concentrated active ingredients, preferably about 10 mL to about 60 mL.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Hand-activation of the device simultaneously activates an atomizer and applies pressure to the fluid within the fluid cartridge sufficient to propel the fluid out of the fluid cartridge. Activation of the atomizer includes moving an orifice structure having exit apertures such that at least one of the exit apertures aligns with a fluid output channel and an emitter electrode tip, thereby allowing the fluid to be electrostatically charged inside the fluid output channel to allow for atomization and dispersion of the fluid after it exits the device.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Linear Orifice Structure</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, depicted is a schematic view of a dispensing apparatus <b>100</b> for electrostatically dispensing fluid. Dispensing apparatus <b>100</b> includes, inter alia, housing <b>102</b>, pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b> (shown in a fully extended position), disposable cartridge <b>106</b>, cartridge receptacle <b>116</b>, disposable cartridge emitter electrode contact <b>108</b>, power supply <b>110</b>, spray charge dissipation mechanism <b>112</b>, and actuator cavities <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The ergonomic housing <b>102</b> is configured to be hand-held and to provide sufficient space for all components used in the apparatus. Such components include, but are not limited to, for example, cartridge receptacle <b>116</b> for receiving and removably holding cartridge <b>106</b>, power supply <b>110</b>, electrical circuitry <b>202</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b>, spray charge dissipation mechanism <b>112</b>, and activating mechanism (not shown) the latter of which includes, inter alia, pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b> and lever <b>226</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The approximate size of housing <b>102</b> and its component is indicated by the 10 mm scale depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Cartridge receptacle <b>116</b> preferably comprises a securing mechanism for removably securing cartridge <b>106</b> within cartridge receptacle <b>116</b>. Examples of suitable securing mechanisms include, but are not limited to, friction fittings, pins, screws, spring-loaded pins, spring loaded latch(es), and the like. The securing mechanism can be manually or automatically engaged when cartridge <b>106</b> is fully placed within cartridge receptacle <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one preferred embodiment, cartridge <b>106</b> is held securely within cartridge receptacle <b>116</b> via engagement of one or more locking receptacles <b>230</b> with corresponding spring-loaded, semi-spherical pins mounted to, or passing through, a wall of cartridge receptacle <b>116</b>. Upon insertion of cartridge <b>106</b> into cartridge receptacle <b>116</b>, each spring-loaded pin is sufficiently depressed into the wall of cartridge receptacle <b>116</b> to allow cartridge <b>106</b> to pass into cartridge receptacle <b>116</b>. Full insertion of cartridge <b>106</b> into the proper position within cartridge receptacle <b>116</b> causes alignment of the spring-loaded, semi-spherical pins with their corresponding locking receptacles <b>230</b>, thereby allowing the spring-loaded pins to release into locking receptacles <b>230</b> and thereby locking cartridge <b>106</b> into cartridge receptacle <b>116</b>. Such locking prevents or minimizes movement of cartridge <b>106</b> within cartridge receptacle <b>116</b> particularly during pressurization of cartridge <b>106</b> and/or activation of lever <b>226</b>. As cartridge <b>106</b> is fully exhausted, pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b> travels further into cartridge receptacle <b>116</b> and causes one or more disengagement extensions <b>234</b> to exert pressure on the spring-loaded, semi-spherical pins causing them to depress and disengage from locking receptacles <b>230</b>. This allows the operator to easily remove cartridge <b>106</b> from cartridge receptacle <b>116</b> when cartridge <b>106</b> is exhausted.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the embodiment of the present invention depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4C</figref>, electrical circuitry <b>202</b> includes voltage converter <b>204</b> for providing sufficient high voltage to power emitter electrode <b>318</b> as well as comparator circuitry <b>206</b>, the latter of which provides the operator with indication of one or more operational statuses of the apparatus. DC-DC voltage converter <b>204</b> converts the voltage from power supply <b>110</b> to a voltage sufficient to power the electrostatic atomizer, preferably within the range of &#x2212;5 kV to &#x2212;10 kV or &#x2212;500 V to &#x2212;15 kV with output currents within the range of &#x2212;1 &#x3bc;A to &#x2212;10 &#x3bc;A or &#x2212;1 &#x3bc;A to &#x2212;100 &#x3bc;A.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment of the present invention, the output of the DC-DC voltage converter <b>204</b> includes short protection to avoid damage to dispensing apparatus <b>100</b> in the event that one or more of exit apertures <b>212</b> become clogged, or otherwise inoperable, or an electrical short is caused due to the presence of foreign matter in the inter-electrode (emitter-orifice) region. That is, DC-DC voltage converter <b>204</b> can tolerate continuous shorting of its output without damage. The output voltage ripple of DC-DC voltage converter <b>204</b> is preferably less than 3%, but generally can be 10%, or larger, due the accommodating design of dispensing apparatus <b>100</b>. Dispensing devices such as dispensing devices <b>100</b>, which are not subject to breakdown and spray disruption from voltage excursions and/or variations, are inherently insensitive to power supply variations caused by voltage ripple at the levels noted above.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The design of DC-DC voltage converter <b>204</b> of dispensing device <b>100</b> is optimized to achieve low cost production having a preferred cost of less than $10 per unit. More expensive converters may be substituted without departing from the scope of the present invention, for example, as dictated by market requirements. Preferably, DC-DC voltage converter <b>204</b> has a total volume of less than 20 mL, however, larger volume converter and converter designs may be easily accommodated within housing <b>102</b> of the dispensing apparatus <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, DC-DC voltage converter <b>204</b> circuitry is separated between two or more interconnected modules to permit them to be distributed within the confines of housing <b>102</b> of dispensing apparatus <b>100</b> while providing the same functionality as a single circuit board DC-DC voltage converter.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Power supplies <b>110</b> may include, but are not limited to, for example: disposable batteries including, without limitation, one or more AA batteries and one or more 9 volt transistor batteries; replaceable or rechargeable batteries; fuel cells; solar power; alternators; and mechanically actuated generators including, without limitation, piezo- or tribo-electric generators actuated by lever <b>226</b>. In one embodiment, power supply <b>110</b> includes three (3) AA batteries, which is electrically connected to electrical circuitry <b>202</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and will provide the requisite fixed output voltage of DC-DC voltage converter <b>204</b> as the power supply <b>110</b> voltage varies with use from approximately 4.8 V to approximately 3.6 V.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Comparator circuitry <b>206</b> accepts current from orifice structure <b>208</b>, lever <b>226</b> (which is a conductive operating lever in the depicted embodiment), and spray charge dissipation mechanism <b>112</b>. Spray dissipation may include, but is not limited to, for example, a static wick or drag-line which acts to dissipate spray charge build-up to the ambient atmosphere. In one embodiment, spray charge dissipation mechanism <b>112</b> is commercially available static wick material built into housing <b>102</b> which facilitates a convenience of use similar to that of an aerosol can.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, spray charge dissipation mechanism <b>112</b> is one or more brush strips including, without limitation, Ultra Stat&#xae; Static Elimination Brushes as manufactured by Ultrafab, Inc. This dissipation mechanism is capable of dissipating the approximately one &#x3bc;A spray current generated by dispensing device <b>100</b>, which is important for achieving continuous spray operation. In one embodiment, the length of the linear brush strips is less than 20 cm, and the length of the bristles thereof is approximately 6 mm long. This size allows the brush strips to be easily integrated into dispensing device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In yet another alternate embodiment, spray charge dissipation mechanism <b>112</b> is an anti-static paint such as that manufactured by AntiStatic Industries. In one such embodiment, an approximately 3 cm by 4 cm swatch of anti-static paint is applied to the base of housing <b>102</b> of dispensing device <b>100</b>. However, alternate spray charge dissipation mechanisms may be substituted for any of those discussed above including, without limitation, thoriated, lanthanated, or cesiated tungsten wires, reconstructed oxide-metal composites, and 325 by 325 0.0014&#x2033; diameter stainless steel wire mesh.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Based on the relative levels of these three currents, comparator circuitry <b>206</b> actuates appropriate indicators <b>210</b> to indicate status to the operator including, but not limited to, for example: apparatus <b>100</b> is in stand-by mode; apparatus <b>100</b> is operating properly; cartridge <b>106</b> is empty; and/or one of exit apertures <b>212</b> is clogged and a new exit aperture <b>212</b>, if applicable, must be moved into place. Indicators <b>210</b> include, but are not limited to, for example, lights, buzzers, vibrators, and other visual, mechanical, and/or audible alarms.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">More specifically, in the absence of current flow to spray charge dissipation mechanism <b>112</b>, structure orifice <b>208</b>, and/or lever <b>226</b>, comparator circuitry <b>206</b> indicates that apparatus is in stand-by mode (or its non-dispensing position). Once apparatus <b>100</b> begins spraying fluid <b>310</b>, current flow to spray charge dissipation mechanism <b>112</b>, structure orifice <b>208</b>, and/or lever <b>226</b> begins. Upon sensing same, comparator circuitry <b>206</b> indicates to the operator via an indicator <b>210</b> that apparatus <b>100</b> is operating properly. In addition, when cartridge depleted switch <b>220</b> is actuated by indicator extension <b>218</b>, the change in position of switch <b>220</b> indicates to comparator circuitry <b>206</b> that pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b> is fully extended and replacement of cartridge <b>106</b> is required. Lever action, in the absence of both current to spray charge dissipation mechanism <b>112</b> and a signal from switch <b>220</b> that cartridge <b>106</b> is depleted, indicates that orifice structure <b>208</b> is clogged, defective, and in need of substitution or replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b> provides sufficient pressure to fluid reservoir <b>302</b> to eject fluid <b>310</b> through fluid output channel <b>314</b>, past emitter electrode tip <b>320</b>, and out of cartridge <b>106</b> through exit aperture <b>212</b>. In a preferred embodiment, pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b> is a piston and a mechanism for moving the piston, such mechanism coupled to lever <b>226</b> and actuated by an operator of apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Fluid <b>310</b> is contained within fluid reservoir <b>302</b> of cartridge <b>106</b> by orifice structure <b>208</b> which acts to seal fluid output channel <b>314</b> when it is located in a non-dispensing position. Fluid <b>310</b> may be any non-conductive fluid including, but not limited to, for example, insecticides, lubricating oils (e.g., WD-40), cooking oils (e.g., Canola, Soy, Olive, and Corn oils), fragrances, pharmaceuticals, grooming products, coatings, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b> is located internal to housing <b>102</b>, and it engages cartridge <b>106</b> after insertion thereof into cartridge receptacle <b>116</b>. Pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b> moves longitudinally within cartridge <b>106</b>, thereby applying pressure to fluid reservoir <b>302</b> as pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b> moves into cartridge <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a preferred embodiment, pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b> includes indicator extension <b>218</b> external to cartridge <b>106</b>, which moves along with pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b> and which engages cartridge depleted switch <b>220</b> when fluid <b>310</b> is fully expended from fluid reservoir <b>302</b> and pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b> has moved to the end of its range of motion. The change of position of cartridge depleted switch <b>220</b> due to activation of same by indicator extension <b>218</b> causes comparator circuitry <b>206</b> to indicate a cartridge empty alarm to the operator via, for example, an indicator <b>210</b>, thereby notifying the operator that the cartridge is in need or removal or replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b> also includes one or more disengagement extensions <b>234</b>, which, at the end of its range of motion, disengages one or more cartridge securing mechanisms to unlock cartridge <b>106</b> from cartridge receptacle <b>116</b>. Disengagement extensions <b>234</b> also disengage orifice structure <b>208</b> from the activating mechanism, thereby allowing an operator to remove cartridge <b>106</b> from cartridge receptacle <b>116</b> and housing <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Housing <b>102</b> includes an activating mechanism for activating one or more mechanisms within apparatus <b>100</b> including, but not limited to, orifice structure <b>208</b> and pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b>, ultimately resulting in the initiation of one or more atomized sprays. Such an activation mechanism could include one or more solenoids and switches, mechanical linkages and gears, any combination thereof, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When cartridge <b>106</b> is fully secured and seated in cartridge receptacle <b>116</b>, it causes a number of things to occur, including, but not limited to: 1) cartridge <b>106</b> is secured to housing <b>102</b> by one or more securing mechanisms; 2) mechanical and electrical connections are established between the activating mechanism and the moveable orifice structure <b>208</b>; and 3) emitter electrode contact <b>108</b> physically contacts voltage converter contact <b>228</b> thereby causing voltage converter <b>204</b> to supply power to emitter electrode <b>318</b> for energization of the latter.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Requiring the secure seating of cartridge <b>106</b> in cartridge receptacle <b>116</b> prior to energization of voltage converter <b>204</b> assures absolute isolation of the operator from the internal high voltage source provided by voltage converter <b>204</b> to converter contact <b>228</b> since orifice structure <b>208</b> is located in the non-dispensing position prior to insertion of cartridge <b>106</b> into housing <b>102</b>. That is, as discussed in greater detail herein, in the non-dispensing position, insulator <b>402</b> of orifice structure <b>208</b> covers emitter electrode <b>318</b> and fluid output passage <b>314</b> thereby isolating the environment external to apparatus <b>100</b> from fluid or current flow.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one preferred embodiment, cartridge <b>106</b> includes a pin <b>224</b> having an upper pin section <b>224</b><i>a </i>and a lower pin section <b>224</b><i>b</i>. Insertion of cartridge <b>106</b> fully into cartridge receptacle <b>116</b> causes lower pin section <b>224</b><i>b </i>to actuate a water-proofed cartridge insertion status switch <b>222</b> mounted on pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b>, thereby establishing an electrical connection between power supply <b>110</b> and electrical circuitry <b>202</b>. This electrical connection energizes voltage converter <b>204</b> and comparator circuitry <b>206</b>. Comparator circuitry <b>206</b> grounds the orifice structure and indicates various operational statuses including, but not limited to, the status of the insertion of cartridge <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition to establishing an electrical connection, the engagement of lower pin section <b>224</b><i>b </i>with the water-proofed cartridge insertion status switch <b>222</b> mounted on pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b> ensures the azimuthal positioning of cartridge <b>106</b>. Such positioning is important to ensure that emitter electrode contact <b>108</b> makes contact (and an electrical connection) with the recessed converter conductor <b>228</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The mechanical connection of orifice structure <b>208</b> to the activating mechanism occurs via engagement of notches <b>418</b> with indexing structures of the activating mechanism as discussed in greater detail below with regards to FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, depicted is an angled, cross-sectional view of disposable cartridge <b>106</b> having a linear orifice structure <b>208</b>. Disposable cartridge <b>106</b> includes a substantially cylindrical reservoir <b>302</b>, the topmost end of which includes dispensing apparatus <b>304</b>. Dispensing apparatus <b>304</b> includes head <b>306</b>, emitter electrode <b>318</b>, fluid channel <b>314</b>, locking receptacle <b>230</b>, and orifice structure <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one embodiment of the present invention, cartridge <b>106</b> is manufactured of a thin walled, flexible, electrically insulating material including, but not limited to, for example, polyethylene, polypropylene, or other flexible polymers having good to excellent electrical and mechanical properties. The use of such material allows the bottommost portion of the walls of cartridge <b>106</b> to fold into itself due to the force exerted by pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b> as it progresses upward and into cartridge <b>106</b>. This force decreases the size of reservoir <b>302</b>, thereby applying pressure to fluid <b>310</b>. This is best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in which cartridge <b>106</b> is shown in a partially exhausted condition, pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b> having folded the rearward casing of cartridge <b>106</b> inward.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In a preferred embodiment, the shape of pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b> closely conforms to that of cartridge <b>106</b> to allow pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b> to fold the cartridge in a manner that minimizes the amount of fluid <b>310</b> trapped between the interior folded surfaces of cartridge <b>106</b>. This feature minimizes the waste and environmental impact associated with the discarded cartridge <b>106</b>. Alternate embodiments may be substituted including, but not limited to, for example, cartridges having accordion pleating.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Cartridge <b>106</b> includes a pin <b>224</b> having an upper pin section <b>224</b><i>a </i>and a lower pin section <b>224</b><i>b</i>. Upper pin section <b>224</b><i>a </i>is substantially cylindrical and fits tightly into fluid output channel <b>314</b> when cartridge <b>106</b> is fully exhausted. When cartridge <b>106</b> is completely exhausted, the walls of cartridge <b>106</b> are collapsed upon and pressed against reservoir upper interior wall <b>328</b>, thereby sealing any fluid trapped within the interior folded walls, creases, or crevasses of depleted cartridge <b>106</b> from leakage to the environment. In this position, upper pin section <b>224</b><i>a </i>is forced into fluid output channel <b>314</b>, precisely mating therewith and thereby facilitating the spraying of any residual fluid <b>310</b> from cartridge <b>106</b>. That is, when cartridge <b>106</b> is in an almost completely exhausted state, upper pin section <b>224</b> is located internal to fluid output channel <b>314</b> and any fluid remaining in pin cavity <b>326</b> is electrostatically atomized by emitter electrode <b>318</b>, thereby forcing the atomized fluid <b>310</b> out of cartridge <b>106</b> through the corresponding exit aperture <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Once cartridge <b>106</b> is completely exhausted and pressure is released from lever <b>226</b>, orifice structure <b>208</b> returns to its non-dispensing state, thereby causing any minimal residual fluid trapped within the interior folded walls, creases, or crevasses of depleted cartridge <b>106</b> to be redundantly sealed within the depleted cartridge <b>106</b> (and from leakage to the environment) via the contact between the uppermost end of upper pin section <b>224</b><i>a </i>and fluid output channel <b>314</b> with interior face <b>330</b> of orifice structure <b>208</b>. This sealing occurs prior to the removal of the depleted cartridge <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The topmost portion of reservoir <b>302</b> is bounded by head <b>306</b>. Face <b>312</b> of head <b>306</b> is substantially planar and is located at an angle of approximately thirty (30) degrees relative to the axis of substantially cylindrical reservoir <b>302</b>. Substantially cylindrical fluid output channel <b>314</b> passes from reservoir <b>302</b> through head <b>306</b> in alignment with one or more exit apertures of orifice structure <b>208</b> when such structure is located in a dispensing position.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Emitter electrode <b>318</b> includes emitter electrode contact <b>108</b> and emitter electrode tip <b>320</b>. Emitter electrode contact <b>108</b> is embedded in the substantially cylindrical outwardly facing wall <b>322</b> of disposable cartridge <b>106</b>. Emitter electrode tip <b>320</b> is positioned toward fluid output channel <b>314</b>. The position of emitter electrode tip <b>320</b> relative to the exit aperture <b>212</b> aligned with fluid output channel <b>314</b> is that which best achieves the desired operating voltage for emitter electrode <b>318</b>. Typical distances between emitter electrode tip <b>320</b> and exit aperture <b>212</b> vary from a minimum of approximately one half of the radius of exit aperture <b>212</b> to a maximum of two to four times the length of the radius of exit aperture <b>212</b>. When multiple exit apertures <b>212</b> are served by a single centrally positioned emitter electrode tip <b>320</b>, distances between the two may exceed ten times the radius of exit aperture <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The limited useful operational life of approximately several minutes of cartridge <b>106</b> permits consistent charge injection of fluid <b>310</b> to be reliably achieved with micron diameter sized emitter electrodes. In some embodiments, emitter electrode <b>318</b> is a thoriated tungsten wire electrode or lanthanum doped tungsten wire electrode having a diameter greater than 1 micron and less than 100 microns, however, other emitter electrodes may be substituted. Use of such emitter electrodes provides more than adequate charge injection at useful voltage levels and drastically reduces the cost of manufacturing cartridge <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As discussed in further detail below with respect to orifice structure <b>208</b>, when energized, emitter electrode tip <b>320</b> electrostatically charges fluid <b>310</b> as it passes through the path of emitter electrode tip <b>320</b> as it is exiting cartridge <b>106</b> through fluid output channel <b>314</b> prior to being dispensed through one or more exit apertures <b>212</b>. That is, in one embodiment of preferred operation, fluid <b>310</b>, under pressure, exits reservoir <b>302</b> through fluid output channel <b>314</b> past emitter electrode tip <b>320</b> and out through one or more exit apertures <b>212</b> in orifice structure <b>208</b>. As fluid <b>310</b> passes over emitter electrode tip <b>320</b>, it becomes electrically charged and subsequently atomizes and self-disperses after exiting cartridge <b>106</b> through exit aperture(s) <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In a preferred embodiment, orifice structure <b>208</b> is moveable and slides or rotates to position an exit aperture <b>212</b> into and out of alignment with fluid output channel <b>314</b> and emitter electrode <b>320</b>. Orifice structure <b>208</b> can be moved between two basic states: 1) fluid output channel <b>314</b> closed to the environment and emitter electrode <b>318</b> electrically insulated from environment (i.e., the non-dispensing position); and 2) fluid output channel <b>314</b> open to the environment and orifice structure <b>208</b> is grounded (i.e., the dispensing position). Orifice structure <b>208</b> moves into the dispensing position to dispense fluid <b>310</b> from within reservoir <b>302</b> when a user squeezes lever <b>226</b> or another similar activation mechanism. Grounding of orifice structure <b>208</b> eliminates a shock hazard for the user when apparatus <b>100</b> is in its dispensing position.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref>, linear orifice structure <b>208</b> includes insulator <b>402</b> and conductor <b>404</b>. Linear orifice structures are most useful for applications such as compact burners in which clogging issues are less severe and a limited number of orifices are adequate to address clogging issues during operation. The cost of the linear orifice structure is sufficiently inexpensive to allow cartridge <b>106</b> and its associated linear orifice structure to be disposable and to accommodate use of a new cartridge <b>106</b> for each use of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Insulator <b>402</b> is an insulating support structure capable of supporting conductor <b>404</b>. In one embodiment of the present invention, insulator <b>402</b> is manufactured of PolyEtherEtherKetone (&#x201c;PEEK&#x201d;) however other materials including, but not limited to, high temperature, high strength engineering plastics may be substituted. Conductor <b>404</b> is electrically conductive and is in contact with local ground. Conductor <b>404</b> includes exit apertures <b>212</b> or groupings of exit apertures <b>212</b> that align with a corresponding orifice <b>414</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In one embodiment of the present invention, circular or cylindrical exit apertures <b>212</b> have diameters ranging from approximately 30 microns to approximately 125 microns. In another embodiment, circular or cylindrical exit apertures <b>212</b> have diameters ranging from approximately 30 microns to approximately 500 microns. In yet another alternate embodiment, slits having widths ranging from approximately 30 microns to approximately 125 microns may be substituted for circular or cylindrical exit apertures <b>212</b> of similar size. In still another alternate embodiment, slits having widths ranging from approximately 30 microns to approximately 500 microns may be substituted for circular or cylindrical exit apertures <b>212</b> of similar size. This range is selected since, when operating at atmospheric background pressures, charged fluids exiting apertures <b>212</b> having a diameter or width less than approximately 125 microns have surface electric field levels that are less than the spray limiting electrical breakdown strength of normal atmospheric air. In contrast, when the diameters of circular exit apertures (or the widths of slit exit apertures) are greater than approximately 125 microns, spray development is abruptly disrupted when the surface electric field strength (caused by increased applied emitter electrode voltage) exceeds the breakdown field strength of the ambient air. However, when the diameters of circular exit apertures (or the widths of slit exit apertures) are maintained at a size less than approximately 125 microns, such breakdowns do not occur. In addition, the smaller the diameter or width of the aperture, the higher the electrical breakdown strength will be, thereby allowing operation at higher altitudes.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Optimal operation of apparatus <b>100</b> may be achieved over a broad range of converter voltages provided that the spray fluid does not break down as discussed above. Optimal operation includes charged fluid droplets having a maximum output charge density, minimum droplet size, and minimum distribution span. The use of relatively smaller exit apertures <b>212</b> also eliminates the need for control circuitry for maintaining optimal converter voltage (i.e., voltage within a few percent of the breakdown limit) as typically required by larger aperture devices.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Additionally, use of circular or cylindrical exit apertures <b>212</b> have diameters ranging from approximately 30 microns to approximately 125 microns (or exit slits having widths within the same range) provides at least three operational benefits. First, it allows the use of inexpensive and unregulated power supplies <b>110</b> because spray behavior will not be detrimentally affected by power supply output fluctuations. Second, it allows a fixed operating voltage to be used since spray behavior (i.e., flow rates and fluid properties) is not affected by voltage converter operating voltage fluctuations. Insensitivity to varying or inconsistent flow rates is particularly important for applications involving unregulated blow-down or hand-pumped fluid supplies as described herein. Third, the smaller the diameter of the exit aperture, the lower the minimum voltage converter operating voltage required to achieve optimal spraying. For instance, direct injection atomizers having exit apertures with an approximately 50 micron diameter can be operated at operating voltages of less than approximately 1 kV without impact on flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Furthermore, since exit apertures having relatively small diameters as discussed above operate at maximum charge density, the fluid sprays exiting therefrom exhibit the narrowest possible size distribution. That is, these size distributions have droplet size spans at least three times narrower than those of conventional aerosol atomizers. The smaller the diameter of the exit aperture, the narrower the droplet size span.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Most importantly, charged sprays exiting apertures having relatively small diameters as discussed above have well-defined size distributions characterized by the absence of large droplet &#x201c;tails&#x201d; and droplets smaller than approximately 10 microns. Not only are such sprays free of large and wasteful droplet populations, but droplet inhalation is not possible. The only inhalation hazard is associated with evaporated vapor as the droplets flow toward the target.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the depicted embodiment, insulator <b>402</b> is a substantially rectangular body manufactured of any suitable insulating material such as, but not limited to, plastic, bakelite, nylon, ceramic, PEEK, glass, lexan, and the like. In both dispensing and non-dispensing positions, insulator <b>402</b> entirely covers cartridge receptacle <b>116</b> and isolates it from the exterior of the apparatus (with the exception of exit apertures <b>212</b>), thereby constraining the high voltage provided by converter contact <b>228</b> to emitter electrode <b>318</b> to the interior of apparatus <b>100</b> to prevent a shock hazard for the user.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, insulator <b>402</b> includes two orifices <b>414</b> arranged in a linear manner. While the depicted embodiment includes two individual and selectable orifices, greater or lesser quantities of orifices may be substituted without departing from the scope of the present invention. Also, orifices and corresponding exit apertures need not be identical and may be configured to meet specific needs. Additionally, non-linear embodiments may also be substituted. One example of such an alternate embodiment is the six orifice, rotary embodiment discussed below with respect to FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A first longitudinal edge of insulator <b>402</b> includes a plurality of substantially semi-cylindrical notches <b>418</b>. Notches <b>418</b> are provided to facilitate movement of orifice structure <b>208</b> as required to dispense fluid from reservoir <b>302</b>. Notches <b>418</b> of insulator <b>402</b> mate with corresponding indexing structures integral to the activating mechanism. These indexing structures index orifice structure <b>208</b> to the desired position (i.e., dispensing or non-dispensing) when lever <b>226</b> is actuated by a user. That is, via engagement with notches <b>418</b>, indexing structures move orifice structure <b>208</b> to a dispensing position in which an exit aperture <b>212</b> aligns with emitter electrode tip <b>320</b> to facilitate electrostatic atomization, or to a non-dispensing position in which insulator <b>402</b> covers emitter electrode <b>318</b> and the external end of fluid output passage <b>314</b>, thereby sealing cartridge <b>106</b> from, and electrically isolating it from, the external environment.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiment of the invention, notches <b>418</b> also allow an operator to select one of a plurality of orifices such as orifices <b>414</b>. Such selection may be desired when orifices having different characteristics are included to allow a user to select a specific orifice configuration. However, even if all orifices are identical, an operator may wish to select a new orifice if the current orifice is clogged or otherwise unusable. To facilitate this feature, in the case of a linear orifice structure such as structure <b>208</b>, lever <b>226</b> would be configured to permit translation of orifice structure <b>208</b> without pressurization of cartridge <b>106</b>. One method of doing this is to disable the return stroke of lever <b>226</b> when an operator is selecting an orifice and to enable the return stroke of lever <b>226</b> when a user wishes to pressurize reservoir <b>302</b> in an effort to spray fluid <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Orifices <b>414</b> in orifice structure <b>208</b>, as illustrated, can have different exit aperture sizes and configurations. An example, both single and multiple openings are shown. Different configurations and sizes are selected based upon, for example, the fluid used, the spray flow rate desired, and the intended use of the spray. Orifice structure <b>208</b> includes varying exit aperture configurations to allow the user to select the configuration most suited to the user's application. For example, use of an orifice having a large diameter exit aperture and/or multiple exit apertures will provide a user with a higher flow rate. Or, in another example, user of an orifice having multiple skewed exit apertures may enhance lateral dispersion of the sprayed fluid. Any configuration of exit apertures may be included without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref>, orifice structure <b>208</b> includes two identical orifices <b>414</b><i>a </i>and <b>414</b><i>b</i>. However, the exit apertures <b>212</b> located in conductor <b>404</b> that are located within orifices <b>414</b><i>a </i>and <b>414</b><i>b </i>when orifice structure <b>208</b> is assembled vary. More specifically, the portion of conductor <b>404</b> located within orifice <b>414</b><i>a </i>includes four (4) exit apertures <b>212</b> arranged as the corners of a square. Such a configuration maximizes lateral dispersion of the sprayed fluid. In contrast, the portion of conductor <b>404</b> located within orifice <b>414</b><i>b </i>includes a single exit aperture <b>212</b> centrally located within orifice <b>414</b><i>b</i>. This orifice provides a single stream of fluid at a higher flow rate due to the larger diameter of its exit aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In addition, the incorporation of multiple orifices <b>414</b> within orifice structure <b>208</b> allows an operator to select a new orifice <b>414</b> if the currently used orifice <b>414</b> becomes clogged or otherwise unusable. Such a feature increases the likelihood that an operator will have the ability to deplete all of fluid <b>310</b> in cartridge <b>106</b> prior to its replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Interior face <b>330</b> of insulator <b>402</b> includes recess <b>408</b> and it is configured to mate with conductor <b>404</b> as best depicted in the exploded and assembled views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, respectively. That is, groove <b>408</b> includes linear groove portion <b>410</b> and a series of curved groove inlets <b>412</b>. Each groove inlet <b>412</b> includes a corresponding orifice <b>414</b>. As orifice extends through insulator <b>402</b> from its interior surface to an exterior surface, its diameter enlarges in a semi-spherical manner.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">When orifice structure <b>208</b> is indexed to a dispensing position and exit aperture <b>212</b> and its surrounding conductor <b>404</b> are aligned with emitter electrode <b>318</b>, the electrically conductive conductor <b>404</b> and emitter electrode <b>318</b> form a charge injection electrostatic atomizer which electrostatically charges fluid <b>310</b> in fluid output channel <b>314</b> to allow it to atomize and disperse upon exiting exit aperture <b>212</b>. Conversely, when orifice structure <b>208</b> is indexed to a non-dispensing position, emitter electrode <b>318</b> is aligned with insulator <b>404</b> (rather than conductor <b>404</b>), which seals fluid output channel <b>314</b>. In addition, emitter electrode <b>318</b> ceases to act as an electrostatic atomizer, there is no current flow from emitter electrode <b>318</b>, flow of fluid <b>310</b> is ceased, and the high voltage present at the emitter electrode is isolated from the exterior of apparatus <b>100</b>. This aspect of the invention allows emitter electrode <b>318</b> to be continuously maintained at operating voltage without damage to apparatus <b>100</b> or fluid <b>310</b> and without danger to an operator. This aspect also allows spraying of fluid <b>310</b> to resume immediately upon indexing of orifice structure <b>208</b> to a dispensing position via actuation of lever <b>226</b> without the need to coordinate voltage or fluid profiles, as this position causes emitter electrode <b>318</b> to realign with the conductor <b>404</b>. This aspect of the invention further minimizes both the turn-on and turn-off fluid transients and orifice structure dribble. This is particularly useful for burst or pulsed-spray applications such as diesel injectors, which traditionally have a &#x201c;sac&#x201d; volume servicing the orifices. Contrary to the situation with conventional &#x201c;sac&#x201d; designs, the exit aperture(s) of the present invention are not exposed to the external environment after cut off and, therefore, fluid dribble cannot occur.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">To spray fluid <b>310</b> from apparatus <b>100</b> (from reservoir <b>302</b> through fluid output channel <b>314</b> and through exit aperture <b>212</b>), an operator activates the activating mechanism by squeezing lever <b>226</b> or the like with a pressure similar to that used for grease or caulking guns. The squeezing of lever <b>226</b> causes the activating mechanism to index pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b> to fold the bottommost portion of cartridge <b>106</b> into itself, thereby pressurizing cartridge <b>106</b> while simultaneously moving an exit aperture <b>212</b> of orifice structure <b>208</b> toward alignment with emitter electrode tip <b>320</b> (via engagement of indexing structures with notches <b>418</b>). The mechanical linkage of the activating mechanism is configured such that pressurization of cartridge <b>106</b> is complete just prior to aligning exit aperture <b>212</b> with emitter electrode tip <b>320</b>. Since emitter electrode <b>318</b> is continuously energized to operating voltage by converter conductor <b>228</b> whenever cartridge <b>106</b> is seated within cartridge receptacle <b>116</b>, this mechanical arrangement causes charge injection atomization to occur as soon as the exit aperture <b>212</b> is exposed sufficiently to fluid output channel <b>314</b> to permit fluid flow. The configuration of apparatus <b>100</b> is such that the exiting fluid <b>310</b> is charged when it flows over emitter electrode tip <b>320</b> sufficiently to atomize and self-disperse after leaving exit aperture <b>212</b> and any fluid <b>310</b> that is not sufficiently charged cannot be expelled from apparatus <b>100</b> (until it is fully charged). That is, fluid <b>310</b> atomizes and self-disperses after it exits apparatus <b>100</b>. This feature of apparatus <b>100</b> eliminates, or greatly minimizes, non-optimal atomization such as that exhibited by conventional (non-electrostatic) atomizers, particularly during turn-on and turn-off. The charged spray exits exit aperture <b>212</b> and causes no shock hazard to the operator due to the relatively low current level (i.e., microampere current level) of the charged spray.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">When an operator ceases application of pressure to lever <b>226</b>, orifice structure <b>208</b> returns to a sealed, non-dispensing position (i.e., one in which none of the exit apertures <b>212</b> is aligned with fluid output channel <b>314</b> and emitter electrode tip <b>320</b>). Ceasing application of pressure to lever <b>226</b> also causes pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b> to reduce the pressure exerted on cartridge <b>106</b> and the fluid <b>310</b> contained therein. In one embodiment, pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b> is a piston and ceasing application of pressure to lever <b>226</b> causes the piston to retract, thereby reducing the pressure exerted on cartridge <b>106</b> and the fluid <b>310</b> contained therein.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">When cartridge <b>106</b> is completely exhausted and/or the operator wishes to remove cartridge <b>106</b> for some other purpose, pressure is removed from lever <b>226</b> causing orifice structure <b>208</b> to return to its non-dispensing position. Removal of cartridge <b>106</b> from cartridge receptacle <b>316</b> causes lower pin section <b>224</b><i>b </i>to de-actuate water-proofed cartridge insertion status switch <b>222</b> mounted on pressurizing mechanism <b>104</b>, thereby breaking the electrical connection between power supply <b>110</b> and electrical circuitry <b>202</b>. The breaking of this electrical connection de-energizes voltage converter <b>204</b> and de-activates comparator circuitry <b>206</b>. This de-energization increases the life of the power supply and increases safety for the operator by eliminating the shock hazard.</p>

In an alternate embodiment, slits having widths ranging from approximately 30 microns to approximately 125 microns may be substituted for circular or cylindrical conductor exit apertures <b>712</b> of similar size. This diameter is selected for the variety or reasons discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Orifices <b>714</b> in orifice structure <b>708</b> can have differently sized and/or configured conductor exit apertures <b>712</b>, for example, even though only one conductor exit aperture <b>712</b> is shown in each orifice <b>714</b>. Different configurations and sizes are selected based upon, for example, the fluid used, the spray flow rate desired, and the intended use of the spray.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Exterior face <b>706</b> of insulator <b>702</b> includes recess <b>708</b> (not shown) configured to mate with one or more conductors <b>704</b>. Exterior face <b>706</b> of insulator <b>702</b> is in intimate contact with the inwardly facing surface of case floor <b>726</b>. Conductor(s) <b>704</b> are in positive electrical contact with case <b>720</b> at all times.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Solenoid <b>722</b> is centrally positioned on the inwardly facing surface of insulator <b>702</b> and rotates armature <b>724</b>, which is also affixed to the inwardly facing surface of insulator <b>702</b>. Actuation of solenoid <b>722</b> can cause the orifice structure to be actuated in an oscillatory manner or with continuous controllable rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">When solenoid <b>722</b> is to be controlled in an oscillatory manner, the peripheral edge of case <b>720</b> includes one or more indexing tabs (not shown) for the accurate positioning of insulator <b>702</b> in a dispensing or non-dispensing position. The indexing tabs of case <b>720</b> mate with corresponding indexing structures that are integral to the activating mechanism. These indexing structures index insulator <b>702</b> to the desired position (i.e., dispensing or non-dispensing) when armature <b>724</b> is actuated by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">When insulator <b>702</b> is indexed to a dispensing position, conductor exit aperture <b>712</b> and its surrounding conductor <b>704</b> are axially aligned with its dedicated emitter electrode <b>718</b> and its corresponding case exit aperture <b>740</b> which causes the electrically conductive conductor <b>704</b> and emitter electrode <b>718</b> to form a charge injection electrostatic atomizer which electrostatically atomizes fluid <b>310</b> in fluid output channel <b>730</b>. Conversely, when insulator <b>702</b> is indexed to a non-dispensing position, emitter electrode <b>718</b> is aligned with insulator <b>702</b> (rather than conductor <b>704</b>) which seals fluid output channel <b>730</b>. In addition, emitter electrode <b>718</b> ceases to act as an electrostatic atomizer, there is no current flow from emitter electrode <b>718</b>, flow of fluid <b>310</b> is ceased, and the high voltage present at the emitter electrodes <b>718</b> is isolated from the exterior of the dispensing apparatus. Only the fluid contained in the low length to diameter ratio conductor exit apertures <b>712</b> is potentially subjected to non-optimal atomization during orifice structure transition. This aspect of the invention allows emitter electrodes <b>718</b> to be continuously maintained at operating voltage without damage to the dispensing apparatus or the fluid contained within and without danger to an operator. This aspect also allows spraying of fluid <b>310</b> to resume immediately upon indexing of insulator <b>702</b> to a dispensing position without the need to coordinate voltage or fluid profiles, as this position causes emitter electrodes <b>718</b> to realign with exit apertures <b>712</b>.</p>
