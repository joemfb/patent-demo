<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-056325, filed Mar. 12, 2010, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to an array substrate for use in such as a liquid crystal display, and a method of manufacturing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Any liquid crystal display of active matrix type comprises a pixel substrate, a countersubstrate, and a liquid crystal layer interposed between the pixel substrate and the countersubstrate. Of these components, the pixel substrate is a transparent substrate made of, for example, glass. On the transparent substrate, a plurality of gate electrode lines are formed, and a plurality of drain electrode lines are formed intersecting the gate electrode lines. Further, thin-film transistors (TFTs), each made of amorphous silicon or the like, are arranged near the intersections of the gate electrode lines and drain electrode lines. Each TFT is connected not only to a gate electrode line and a drain gate line, but also to a pixel electrode that is a transparent electrode made of, for example, indium-tin oxide (ITO). The countersubstrate is a transparent substrate made of, for example, glass. On the countersubstrate, a counterelectrode is made of transparent material such as ITO.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In recent years, various methods have been proposed, which are designed to manufacturer an array substrate of so-called &#x201c;top ITO structure.&#x201d; In each of these methods, pixel electrodes are formed on the uppermost layer of the pixel substrate in order to reduce the number of steps of manufacturing the pixel substrate, as described in, for example, Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 2005-242372. To ensure electrical connection of the lines running on the layers of the top ITO structure, the layers have contact holes. Through the contact holes, the lines extend through layers, whereby any line provided on one layer can be electrically connected to a line or lines provided on any other layer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In such a method of manufacturing an array substrate, the gate electrode lines and drain electrode lines can be formed at the same time the TFTs for pixels are formed. This can serve to reduce the manufacturing steps.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is desired that the contact holes should be gently tapered from an upper layer toward a lower layer. If each contact hole is so tapered, a line can extend through the contact hole, not cut at all. As a result, the line reliably connects two associate lines provided on the upper and lower layer, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A plurality of contact holes of different depths may be made in the same manufacturing step. In this case, a shallow contact hole is exposed to etchant for a longer time than a deep contact hole. The shallow contact hole will be over-etched. If over-etched, the contact hole may be tapered in the reverse direction, that is, from a lower layer to an upper layer. (This result will be called &#x201c;reverse taper.&#x201d;)</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The line formed in any contact hole of reverse taper may be cut at any part. If this happens, the associated two lines provided on the upper and lower layers, respectively, may not be connected.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Embodiments of the invention will be explained with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram showing a schematic configuration of a liquid crystal display panel that includes a display array substrate according to an embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The liquid crystal display panel shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises a pixel substrate, and a countersubstrate, and a liquid crystal layer interposed between the pixel substrate and countersubstrate.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">On the pixel substrate, a plurality of gate electrode lines G and a plurality of drain electrode lines D are arranged, the former intersecting with the latter. Pixel electrodes <b>112</b> are arranged, respectively, at the positions corresponding to the intersections of the gate electrode lines G and drain electrode lines D.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Each pixel electrodes <b>112</b> is made of transparent conductive film of, for example, indium-tin oxide (ITO). As shown at region P of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the pixel electrodes <b>112</b> is connected to the source electrode S of a thin-film transistor TFT, which functions as a switching element.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The pixel substrate according to the embodiment has the top ITO structure. The top ITO structure has an ITO layer that is the uppermost layer of the multi-layer substrate. In the top ITO structure, each pixel electrode <b>112</b> and each source electrode S are connected in a contact hole H<b>1</b> (first contact hole).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The countersubstrate is arranged opposing the pixel substrate. On the countersubstrate, a common electrode COM is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The pixel substrate and the countersubstrate are adhered to each other a seal member (not shown). The seal member seals the space between the pixel substrate and countersubstrate, preventing the liquid crystal leaking from the space.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">One display pixel PIX includes a pixel electrode <b>112</b>, the common electrode COM, and that part of the liquid crystal layer, which lies between the pixel electrode <b>112</b> and the common electrode COM.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Each drain electrode line D is led from the display part of the liquid crystal display panel, on which the display pixels PIX are arranged in the form of a two-dimensional array, and is connected to a drain driver (not shown). As shown at region Q of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a terminal part that connects the drain electrode lines D to a gate driver has openings H<b>2</b>, through which the drain electrode lines D are exposed, respectively. Through the opening H<b>2</b>, ITO is formed as a protective film. The protective film protects the surface of each drain electrode line D.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Each gate electrode line G is led from the display part of the liquid crystal display panel, on which the display pixels PIX are arranged in the form of a two-dimensional array, and is connected to the gate driver (not shown). As shown at region R of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a terminal part that connects the gate electrode lines G to the gate driver has openings H<b>3</b>, through which the gate electrode lines G are exposed, respectively. Through the opening H<b>3</b>, ITO is formed as a protective film. This protective film protects the surface of each gate electrode line G.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Further, jumper lines J are connected to the gate electrode lines G, respectively, so that the jumper lines J are extending parallel to the gate electrode lines G. Because of the use of jumper lines, the interconnect resistance can be lower than in the case where only the gate electrode lines G are used. As will be described later in detail, the jumper lines J are formed in the same step in the embodiment, as the drain electrodes (drain electrode lines) D and source electrodes S of TFTs. Hence, as shown at region S of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the gate electrode lines G are connected to the respective jumper lines J, in contact holes H<b>4</b> (second contact holes).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A method of manufacturing a pixel substrate for use in a display array substrate according to the embodiment of the invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3F</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4F</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5E</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6F</figref> are diagrams showing a method of manufacturing a pixel substrate to be used as the display array substrate according to the embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart showing the method of manufacturing the pixel substrate for use as the display array substrate according to the embodiment of the invention. The method includes six steps, which will be described later. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref> are magnified sectional views, taken along line II-II shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, showing the steps of forming a TFT part. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref> are magnified sectional views, taken along lines III-III and line III&#x2032;-III&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, showing the steps of forming a terminal part. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref> are magnified sectional views, taken along lines IV-IV and IV&#x2032;-IV&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, showing the steps of forming an interconnect part. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref> are magnified sectional views, taken along lines V-V shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, showing the steps of forming the jumper line part of the interconnect part. The TFTs manufactured in the method according to the embodiment are TFTs of inverse stagger structure. In the inverse stagger structure, the gate electrode is formed at a lower layer, and the drain and source electrodes are formed at an upper layer.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">First, in the first step (Step S<b>1</b>), spattering is performed, forming a thin metal film (first conductive film) of Mo (molybdenum) or alloy thereof, on a transparent substrate (glass substrate) <b>100</b>. Then, photoresist is applied to the thin metal film formed on the glass substrate <b>100</b>, forming various electrode patterns by means of photolithography. Dry etching, for example, is then performed, removing those parts of the thin metal film, which are not coated with the photoresist, and maintaining those parts of the thin metal film, which are coated with the photoresist. As a result, a prescribed first conductive film pattern is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The first conductive film pattern, thus formed in the first step, includes a gate electrode <b>101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a film <b>103</b> for stopping etching, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a gate terminal <b>122</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, and gate electrodes <b>131</b> and <b>142</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the gate electrode line <b>101</b>, gate electrode line <b>131</b> and gate terminal <b>122</b> appear isolated from one another. In fact, they are elements of the same pattern, and are continuous to one another as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. By contrast, the film <b>103</b> for stopping etching is pattern-formed, insulated from the gate electrode <b>101</b>, from the gate electrode lines <b>131</b> and <b>142</b>, and from the gate terminal <b>122</b>. The film <b>103</b> for stopping etching is used as a protective film that will protect the glass substrate <b>100</b> in the step of making a contact hole H<b>1</b> used in order to form the pixel electrode <b>112</b> as will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Next, in the second step (Step S<b>2</b>), a G-SiN layer (gate-insulating nitride silicon film, or first insulating layer) <b>104</b>, an i-Si film (neutral amorphous silicon film, or semiconductor film) <b>105</b>, and a BL-SiN layer (silicon nitride film of protecting the channel) are formed, one after another.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Thereafter, photoresist is applied to the BL-SiN layer. Then, photolithography is performed on the BL-SiN layer, forming a prescribed pattern. At this point, the G-SiN layer is kept intact in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Thus, in the second step, a gate insulating layer <b>104</b>, a semiconductor film <b>105</b>, and a BL layer (channel protective layer) <b>106</b> are formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. The semiconductor film <b>105</b> serves as channels of TFTs. The BL layer <b>106</b> is a protective layer that protects the semiconductor film <b>105</b> while an ohmic contact layer <b>107</b> (later described) is being etched.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Next, in the third step (Step S<b>3</b>), aqueous solution of ammonium fluoride (NH<sub>4</sub>F) is applied, removing the natural oxide film formed on the semiconductor film <b>105</b> exposed after the second step. Then, plasma CVD method, for example, is performed, forming an n+Si (N-type amorphous silicon film, or ohmic contact layer) <b>107</b>. The ohmic contact layer <b>107</b> is provided in order to enhance the ohmic contact between the semiconductor film <b>105</b>, on the one hand, and the source and drain electrodes, on the other. After the ohmic contact layer <b>107</b> has been formed, spattering is performed, a thin metal film (second conductive film) of Mo or alloy thereof, on the ohmic contact layer <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As described above, the source electrode S, drain electrode (drain electrode line) D, etc., are processed at the same time. Therefore, the second conductive film pattern is formed by, for example, dry etching, removing those parts of the thin metal film, which are not coated with photoresist, and maintaining those parts of the thin metal film, which are coated with the photoresist. As a result, a prescribed second conductive film pattern is formed. Thus, in the third step, the drain electrode <b>108</b> and source electrode <b>109</b> of a TFT, drain terminal <b>123</b>, drain electrode line <b>132</b> and jumper line <b>143</b> are formed, as second conductive film pattern, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the source electrode <b>109</b> is pattern-formed, with one part overlapping the film <b>103</b> for stopping etching, so that the drain electrode <b>108</b> may be electrically connected to the pixel electrode <b>112</b> to be formed in a process, which will be explained later. Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, the jumper line <b>143</b> is pattern-formed, with one part overlapping the gate electrode line <b>142</b>, so that the gate electrode line <b>142</b> may be electrically connected to the jumper line <b>143</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The drain electrode <b>108</b> and source electrode <b>109</b> of the TFT, drain terminal <b>123</b>, drain electrode line <b>132</b> and jumper line <b>143</b>, so formed, are then used as mask, and etching is performed on the ohmic contact layer <b>107</b> and the semiconductor film <b>105</b>, to accomplish patterning. At this point, in the TFT part, only the ohmic contact <b>107</b> is etched as indicated by <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, whereas the semiconductor film <b>105</b> is not etched, protected by the BL layer <b>106</b>. In any part other than the TFT part, those parts of the semiconductor film <b>105</b> and ohmic contact layer <b>107</b>, which are not masked with electrodes, are removed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Next, in the fourth step (Step S<b>4</b>), an OC-SiN layer (overcoat silicon nitride film, or second insulating layer) <b>111</b> is formed by, for example, plasma CVD method, on each electrode formed in the third step and on the gate insulating layer <b>104</b>, in order to protect the entire pixel substrate including the semiconductor film <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Thereafter, in the fifth step (Step S<b>5</b>), photoresist is applied to the OC-SiN layer <b>111</b>, and contact holes H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b>, H<b>3</b> and H<b>4</b> are made by means of photolithography. In the embodiment, contact holes H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b>, H<b>3</b> and H<b>4</b> are made, each extending from the OC-SiN layer <b>111</b> to the gate insulating layer <b>104</b>. Therefore, the expose the source electrode <b>109</b>, thin film <b>103</b> for stopping etching, gate terminal <b>122</b>, drain terminal <b>123</b>, gate electrode line <b>142</b> and jumper line <b>143</b>, respectively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref>. Contact holes H<b>1</b> and H<b>4</b> are made in the region where the edges of the second conductive film pattern overlap the first conductive film pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Finally, in the sixth step (Step S<b>6</b>), spattering is performed, forming an ITO film in contact holes H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b>, H<b>3</b> and H<b>4</b> made in the fifth step. In this embodiment, no ITO film is formed on the interconnect part. The ITO film already formed is first coated with photoresist and then subjected to photolithography. As a result, the ITO film acquires a prescribed pattern. At this time, ITO electrically connects the first conductive film pattern and the second conductive film pattern in contact holes H<b>1</b> and H<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3F and 6F</figref>, the ITO film has a first conductive-film contact region, a second conductive-film contact region, a first conductive region, and a second conductive region. The first conductive-film contact region contacts the first conductive film pattern in contact hole H<b>1</b> and contact holes H<b>4</b>. The second conductive-film contact region contacts the second conductive film pattern in contact hole H<b>1</b> and contact holes H<b>4</b>. The first conductive region electrically connects the forming region of the second insulating layer, first conductive-film contact region and second conductive-film contact region, to one another. The second conductive region is a region extending from the first conductive-film contact region to the forming region, electrically connecting the first conductive-film contact region and the forming region to each other. Nonetheless, the second conductive region does not contact the second conductive film pattern, which does not exist between the first conductive-film contact region and the forming region.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the sixth step, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref>, the pixel electrode <b>112</b>, an ITO film <b>124</b> protecting the gate terminal <b>122</b>, and an ITO film <b>125</b> protecting the drain terminal <b>123</b>, and an ITO film <b>144</b> electrically connecting the gate electrode line <b>142</b> and the jumper line <b>143</b>, are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The pixel electrode <b>112</b> has been formed by processing the ITO film, in such a way that it is connected to the drain electrode or the source electrode by the thin-film contact region of the ITO film and the forming region of the second insulating layer. As the six steps described above are performed, a pixel substrate according to the embodiment is manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The method of manufacturing a display array substrate, according to the embodiment, will be compared a comparative method, in order to demonstrate the advantage of the method according to the embodiment. First, the comparative method will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. The components identical to those of the embodiment will not be described.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> are a plan view and a sectional view, respectively, which show, in detail, part E of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref>, which pertains to a jumper line part manufactured by the comparative method. Part E of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref> is the surface of contact hole H<b>4</b>, more precisely that surface part of contact hole H<b>4</b>, which lies in the OC-SiN layer <b>111</b> provided on the jumper line <b>143</b> and that surface part of contact hole H<b>4</b>, which lies in the gate insulating layer <b>104</b> and OC-SiN layer <b>111</b>, both provided on the gate electrode line <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the comparative method, a gate electrode line G (first conductive film pattern) is pattern-formed on a transparent substrate. Further, a jumper line J (second conductive film pattern) is pattern-formed above the gate electrode line G, not overlapping the gate electrode line G. A contact hole Ha and a contact hole Hb are made in the jumper line J and the gate electrode line G, respectively, and the jumper line J and the gate electrode line G are electrically connected by ITO.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref>, the gate electrode line G and the jumper line J are formed as different layers included in the pixel substrate. A contact hole H<b>4</b><i>a </i>and a contact hole H<b>4</b><i>b </i>for exposing the jumper line J and the gate electrode line G, respectively, need to have different depths.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">If the etching for making contact hole H<b>4</b><i>a </i>and the etching for making contact hole H<b>4</b><i>b </i>are started at the same time, the etching lasts longer to make contact hole H<b>4</b><i>a </i>than to make contact hole H<b>4</b><i>b</i>. Over-etching occurs in making contact hole H<b>4</b><i>a</i>. Consequently, contact hole H<b>4</b><i>a </i>may be reversely tapered as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">This is because any electrode changes in upper surface condition when it is etched or a thin film is formed on it. As the upper surface condition changes after etching or after a thin film has been formed on the electrode, the side etching near the interface with the electrode may proceed at an increasing rate. If the thin film formed on the electrode is etched, exposing the electrode, and if the film remains exposed to the etchant thereafter for a long time, the side etching proceeds at higher rate at a position near the interface between the jumper line J and the OC-SiN layer provided on the jumper line J, than at the upper surface of the OS-SiN layer provided on the jumper line J. As a result, contact hole H<b>4</b><i>a </i>is reversely tapered. If this happens, an ITO layer formed in contact hole H<b>4</b><i>a </i>is, in all probability, discontinuous as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. That is, the comparative method can hardly connect the gate electrode line G and the jumper line J, as is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> are a plan view and a sectional view, respectively, which schematically show a jumper line part formed by the method according to the embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, contact hole H<b>4</b> is made in a region where an edge of the jumper line overlaps the gate electrode G and extends from the first insulating layer <b>104</b> to the second insulating layer <b>111</b>. That is, the jumper line J and the gate electrode line G partly overlap each other, and one contact hole H<b>4</b> is made in the overlapping parts. Therefore, that part of the jumper line J, which overlaps the gate electrode line G, is exposed in contact hole H<b>4</b>. In contact hole H<b>4</b>, ITO electrically connects the gate electrode line G and the jumper line J to each other. In this case, that part (i.e., part F shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>) of the OC-SiN layer provided on the jumper line J may indeed etched away because contact hole H<b>4</b> is reversely tapered in part. Nonetheless, that part of contact H<b>4</b>, which is below the jumper line J, is tapered, not inversely at all. This is because the gate electrode line G serves as mask for stopping etching.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">ITO in contact hole H<b>4</b> so made as described above has, in contact hole H<b>4</b>, a first conductive-film contact region (gate-electrode line contact region), a second conductive-film contact region, a forming region, a first conductive region, and a second conductive region. The first conductive-film contact region (gate-electrode line contact region) contacts the gate electrode line G in contact hole H<b>4</b>. The second conductive-film contact region (jumper-line contact region) contacts the jumper line J in contact hole H<b>4</b>. The forming region is formed on the OC-SiN layer. The first conductive region (part G shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>) electrically connects the first conductive-film contact region and second conductive-film contact region. The second conductive region (part H shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>) extends from the first conductive-film contact region to the forming region, electrically connecting the first conductive-film contact region to the forming region, but not contacting the jumper line J, or not existing the second conductive-film contact region between the first conductive-film contact region and the forming region. Hence, the gate electrode line C and the jumper line J can reliably be connected, even if part F shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, for example, is reversely tapered and the ITO is cut at this part F.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref> are a plan view and a sectional view, respectively, which schematically show a TFT part formed by the method according to the embodiment. In this embodiment, that part (part F shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) of the OC-SiN layer, which lies above the source electrode <b>109</b>, may be reversely tapered as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, for the same reason as pointed out above. Nonetheless, that part of the OC-SiN layer, which lies below the source electrode <b>109</b>, is tapered as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">If ITO is formed in contact hole H<b>1</b> made as described above, it will have, in contact hole H<b>1</b>, a first conductive-film contact region, a second conductive-film contact region, a forming region, a first conductive region, and a second conductive region. The first conductive-film contact region (thin-film contact region) contacts the thin film <b>103</b> for stopping etching. The second conductive-film contact region (electrode line contact region) contacts the source electrode <b>109</b>. The forming region is provided on the OC-SiN layer. The first conductive region (part G shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) electrically connects the first conductive-film contact region and the second conductive-film contact region. The second conductive region (part H shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) electrically connects the thin-film contact region and the forming region, and extends from the first conductive-film contact region to the forming region, not contacting the source electrode <b>109</b>, or not existing the second conductive-film contact region between the first conductive-film contact region and the forming region.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Hence, even if part F shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> is reversely tapered and the ITO element is therefore cut, thin film <b>103</b> for stopping etching and the source electrode <b>109</b> are reliably connected. In addition, since the thin film <b>103</b> is reliably connected to the pixel electrode, it can ensure the electrical connection of the source electrode and the pixel electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As the plan view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> shows, the end J<b>1</b> of the jumper line J is shaped convexity and extending in the direction the jumper line J extends. The end J<b>1</b> is so shaped, increasing the area of the ITO element in order to ensure the electrical connection of the jumper line J and the gate electrode G. The shape of the end J<b>1</b> of the jumper line J is not limited to a convex shape, nevertheless. The end J<b>1</b> of the jumper line J may have any other shape.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the embodiment, any elements that should be electrically connected can be reliably connected to one another as described above, even if a display array substrate including TFTs of inverse stagger structure has contact holes of different depths.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the embodiment described above, the jumper line J is connected to the gate electrode line G in order to lower the interconnect resistance of the gate electrode line G. Instead, the jumper line J may be connected to the drain electrode line D. In this case, the jumper line J lies on the same layer as does the gate electrode G, and a part of the drain electrode line D overlaps a part of the jumper line J that lies below the layer.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the embodiment described above, the configuration of the invention is applied to both the TFT part and the jumper line part. Nonetheless, the configuration may be applied to only the TFT part or the jumper line part.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Moreover, in the embodiment, the ITO film contacts the source electrode, at its electrode line contact region. Instead, it may contact the drain electrode, at its electrode line contact region.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
