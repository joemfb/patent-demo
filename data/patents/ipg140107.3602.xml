<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to gallium nitride (GaN) based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), and more particularly to transistors with multiple conductive channels.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">High electron mobility transistor (HEMT), also known as heterostructure FET (HFET) or modulation-doped FET (MODFET), is a transistor incorporating a junction between two materials with different band gaps, i.e., a heterojunction, as the channel. The heterojunction can be contrasted with a doped layer that generally used by MOSFET. As used herein, the heterojunction is the interface that occurs between two layers or regions of dissimilar crystalline semiconductors or other materials. A commonly used material combination is GaAs with AlGaAs with the introduction of modulation doping for two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) generation. Another used material combination is GAN with AlGaN with the introduction of polarization charge for 2DEG generation. The selection of the combination of the materials may vary in dependence on the application.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To allow conduction, semiconductors are doped with impurities, which donate mobile electrons (or holes). However, those electrons are slowed down through collisions with the impurities (dopants) used to generate them in the first place. HEMTs avoid this through the use of high mobility electrons generated using the heterojunction. The heterojunction allows creating a very thin layer of highly mobile conducting electrons with very high concentration, giving the channel very low resistivity, i.e., high electron mobility.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The HEMTs utilizing gallium nitride (GaN) HEMTs have high-power performance. As used herein, GaN materials that are suitable for transistors can include binary, tertiary, or quaternary materials.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of a conventional GaN HEMT device, described in e.g., U.S. publication 2009/0146185, which could be designed to have a threshold voltage of &#x2212;3V. Layer <b>10</b> is a substrate, such as of SiC, sapphire, Si, or GaN, layer <b>11</b> is a GaN buffer, and layer <b>12</b> is AlGaN, with 20% Al composition as an example (Al<sub>0.2</sub>Ga<sub>0.8</sub>N). Layers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> are both Ga-face material. A negative gate voltage is required to deplete the 2DEG under the gate and thereby turn the device off.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The GaN HEMT device can include a Ill-nitride semiconductor body with at least two III-nitride layers formed thereon. The material which forms III-nitride layer <b>12</b>, e.g., AlGaN, has a larger bandgap than that which forms buffer layer <b>11</b>, e.g., GaN. The polarization field that results from the different materials in the adjacent III-nitride layers induces a conductive two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) region near the junction <b>9</b> of the two layers, specifically in the layer with the narrower band gap. The 2DEG region or channel is shown throughout the figures as a dashed line. One of the layers through which current is conducted is the channel layer. Herein, the narrower band gap layer in which the current carrying channel, or the 2DEG channel is located is referred to as the channel layer. The device also includes a gate electrode <b>18</b> and source and drain electrodes <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> on either side of the gate electrode <b>18</b>. The region between the gate and drain and the gate and source, which allows for current to be conducted through the device, is the access region <b>7</b>. The region below the gate electrode <b>18</b> is the gate region <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The improvements in the design of GaN devices are focusing on single channel Ga-polar GaN based HEMTs. However, the conventional Ga-polar HEMT usually requires advanced process techniques such as the gate-recess structure, the F-treatment or capping, layers in making enhancement-mode (E-mode) device. Those techniques can deplete the 2DEG underneath the gate region but suffer from either controllability issue or lattice damage problem.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An N-polar GaN HEMT device has a reverse polarization field and can be advantageous over Ga-polar device in making single channel E-mode device with low access resistance, and in particular, for low voltage operation, see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,948,011. However, despite the increased performance of the N-polar devices, the drive current under low voltage bias for N-polar GaN HEMT is smaller than the state-of-the-art Ga-polar GaN HEMT. This limitation of the drive current degrades the RF amplification capability and limits the output power density of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, there is a need for improvement in current drivability, output power performance and gate controllability of HEMT devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An objective of present invention is to provide a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) having enhanced current carrying capability. It is a further object of some embodiments to provide a HEMT device having dual channels conduction path. It is a further object of some embodiments to provide a HEMT operative at low voltage while preserving current can capability.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is a further object of some embodiments to provide a HEMT with improved breakdown characteristics. It is a further object of some embodiments to reduce an overall thickness of the HEMT, while offering enhanced current carrying capability. It is a further object of some embodiments to simplify a design of such HEMT and to reduce the fabrication complexity. It is a further object of some embodiments to provide a HEMT with E-mode and/or D-mode operations.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Some embodiments of the invention are based on a realization that combination of insulator layer, N-polar Layer and Barrier Layer can be used to create a HEMT having dual channels, i.e., one channel is a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel formed by N-polar layer and barrier layer due to a heterojunction, and another channel is inversion carrier channel formed by insulator layer and N-polar layer due to capacitive relationship between the gate of HEMT and the N-polar layer. Moreover, it is specifically recognized that formation of such dual channels is possible within one layer, i.e., N-polar layer, without creating interference between the channels.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is further recognized that it is advantageous to carefully select the thickness of the insulator layer. This is because the thickness should be selected in dependence of a voltage applied to the gate during the operation such that the inversion carrier channel is created. For example, in various embodiments the thickness of the insulator layer is a proportional function of a dielectric constant of a material of the insulator layer or selected such that a minimum voltage sufficient to control the 2DEG channel is also sufficient to create and control the inversion carrier channel. Also, in some embodiments the thickness of the N-polar layer is selected such that the interference between channels is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, one embodiment discloses a device that includes a source for transmitting an electronic charge through a conduction path; a drain for receiving the electronic charge; a stack for providing at least part of the conduction path; and a gate operatively connected to the stack for controlling a conduction of the electronic charge. Thee stack includes an insulator layer, an N-polar layer and a barrier layer selected such that, during an operation of the device, the conduction path formed in the N-polar layer includes a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel and an inversion carrier channel.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another embodiment discloses a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT). The HEMT includes a source for transmitting an electronic charge through a conduction path; a drain for receiving the electronic charge; a stack for providing at least part of the conduction path; and a gate operatively connected to the stack for controlling a conduction of the electronic charge. The stack includes an insulator layer, an N-polar layer and a barrier layer selected such that during an operation of the device a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel is formed by the N-polar layer and the barrier layer due to a heterojunction, and an inversion carrier channel is formed by the insulator layer and N-polar layer due to capacitive relationship between the gate and the N-polar layer.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The HEMT employing the principles of the invention has enhanced current carrying capability, due to dual channels conduction path. Also, such HEMT has a simplified design due to reduction of numbers and thickness of the layers of a stack, which lead to a reduction of the fabrication complexity. Also, the HEMT according to some embodiments of the invention can be operated at low voltage while preserving current carrying capability, because the reduction of the voltage at the gate and the drain is compensated by an additional channel.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Furthermore, in some embodiments, a material of the insulator layer is selected based on a dielectric constant of the material. For example, the material with the high dielectric constant can be selected to increase insulator thickness for breakdown performance improvement while preserving equivalent oxide thickness of the insulator layer for dual channel feasibility.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Some embodiments take advantage of minimizing the thickness of the layers of the stack till optimum thickness avoiding interference between the dual channels. Specifically, the thickness of the N-polar layer can be reduces. Also, the thickness of the insulator layer can be reduced to improve control of the channels while still avoiding the interference. In some embodiments optional polarization layer is used to provide a HEMT with E-mode. Some other embodiments operate in D-mode.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows a schematic of a device <b>200</b> designed according to embodiments of the invention. The device <b>200</b> can be a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) device. The device includes a source <b>220</b> for transmitting an electronic charge through a conduction path, a drain <b>230</b> for receiving the electronic charge, a stack <b>270</b> for providing at least part of the conduction path, a gate <b>240</b> operatively connected to the stack for controlling a conduction of the electronic charge. The device can also include a buffer <b>250</b> and a substrate <b>260</b>. The stack <b>270</b> can be an N-polar stack <b>270</b> that includes a barrier layer <b>271</b>, an N-polar layer <b>272</b>, and an insulator layer <b>273</b> selected such that, during the operation of the device <b>200</b>, an inversion carrier channel <b>210</b> and a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel <b>211</b> are formed in one N-polar layer <b>272</b>. The channels <b>210</b> and <b>211</b> formed at least part of the conductive path between the source and the drain.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Some embodiments of the invention are based on a realization that combination of the insulator layer, the N-polar layer and the barrier layer can be used to create the HEMT having dual channels within N-polar layer without creating interference between the channels. The 2DEG channel <b>211</b> is formed by N-polar layer and barrier layer due to a hetero unction at an interface <b>278</b>. The inversion carrier channel <b>210</b> is formed by the insulator layer and the N-polar layer due to capacitive relationship between the gate of HEMT and the N-polar layer having a surface interface <b>279</b>. Accordingly, the HEMT device <b>200</b> can enhance current carrying capability, because of the dual-channeling. Also a design of such HEMT can reduce the fabrication complexity due to a single channel layer.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows the dual-channel HEMT device <b>201</b> according to another embodiments of the invention. In this embodiment, the stack <b>270</b> is formed under the gate region <b>240</b>, and the device <b>210</b> further includes a source-to-gate region <b>280</b> and a drain-to-gate region <b>281</b>. Ultra shallow doping <b>290</b> is applied to the surface of the regions <b>280</b> and <b>281</b> to ensure the complete conduction path <b>291</b> (including channel <b>211</b>) from source to drain for surface inversion carrier channel. The diffusion depth of the surface doping can be controlled with a few nanometers to minimize the overlap between the surface inversion carrier channel and the 2DEG channel. The length of the extension regions <b>280</b> and <b>281</b> can be either symmetrical or asymmetrical. Increase of the length of the drain-to-gate region can reduce the leakage current and alleviate the peak electrical field at the drain side of the gate edge to improve device breakdown performance.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-C</figref> are graphs further illustrating the advantages of the dual channel HEMT over a single channel HEMT device. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, one advantage lies in the boost of the drive current. Under low voltage bias (Vgs=5 V and Vds=4 V), the maximum normalized drain current of dual channel readies about 1.83 A/mm, which is almost twice of the single channel device maximum current carrying capability under the same bias condition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. The increase of the drive current is contributed by the surface inversion carrier channel in N-polar GaN layer.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The further increase of the drain current can be achieved by improving current carrying capability of either the surface inversion carrier channel component or the bottom 2DEG sheet channel component, or both of them.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, the current drivability of the surface inversion carrier channel is related to condition of the interface, the electron density and the carrier confinement. The interface condition can be improved by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of the epi-layers to minimize the defects during the fabrication. The electron density can be increased by strengthening the electrical field at the surface interface <b>279</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Because the inversion carrier channel <b>210</b> is separated from the 2DEG channel <b>211</b>, the confinement of each channel minimizes the reduction in electronic carrier mobility. The inversion channel current component enhancement can also be done by further thinning the gate insulator layer <b>273</b>. Small thickness of the insulator enhance the gate control on the N-polar layer <b>272</b> surface condition with a higher inversion carrier density and improve the device short channel effects. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, output characteristics shows a dual channel HEMT with 2 nm AlN and 0.5 nm SiN, has a 1.74&#xd7; drive current as the previous dual channel one, and 3.86&#xd7; drive current as the single channel one under the same bias condition.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The 2DEG current conductivity can be increased by using wide bandgap polarized material with heavy doping for the barrier layer. The wide bandgap polarized material is expected to generate larger net polarization different that induces more 2DEG close to the interface <b>278</b>. The 2DEG mobility can be enhanced by improving the interface condition between the N-polar layer <b>272</b> and the barrier layer <b>271</b>. Therefore, in one embodiment, the thickness and quality of those layers are controlled to assure the epitaxial growth of such a structure.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The 2DEG channel current component enhancement can also be done by vertically scaling the GaN layer. The latter method employs a vertically scaled GaN layer which has a smaller resistance in the vertical direction. The scaling strengthen electric field modulation at the bottom interface <b>278</b> and therefore leads to higher density of inversion of the 2DEG sheet. Output characteristics in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> shows the vertically scaled dual channel HEMT has a 1.25&#xd7; drive current as the previous dual channel one and 2.71&#xd7; drive current as the single channel one under the same bias condition.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments it is realized that substantial thinning of the gate insulator can worsen the gate leakage and scaling of GaN layer can undermine the channel confinement and introduce unwanted quantum effect. Those embodiments consider trade-off between these two methods when optimize dual channel GaN HEMT device.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, in some embodiments, a material of the insulator layer is selected based on a dielectric constant of the material. For example, the material with the high dielectric constant can be selected to increase insulator thickness for breakdown performance improvement while preserving equivalent oxide thickness of the insulator layer for dual channel feasibility. For example, in one embodiment a thickness of the insulator layer is selected such that a minimum voltage sufficient to control the 2DEG channel is also sufficient to create and control the inversion carrier channel.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Some embodiments take advantage of minimizing the thickness of the layers of the stack till optimum thickness avoiding interference between the dual channels. Specifically, the thickness of the N-polar layer can be reduces. Also, the thickness of the insulator layer can be reduced to improve control of the channels while still avoiding the interference. For example, in one embodiment a thickness of the insulator layer is selected in dependence of a voltage applied to the gate during the operation. Specifically, the thickness of the insulator layer can be selected as a proportional function of a dielectric constant of a material of the insulator layer.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an enhanced mode (E-mode) dual-channel MIS-HEMT <b>300</b> designed according to one embodiment of the invention. This embodiment is provided for illustration purpose only and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. A stack <b>370</b> includes a first layer <b>371</b>, which is a polarization layer having an aluminum nitride (AlN) with a wider bandgap and strong polarization. The polarization layer <b>371</b> can be maintained as an undoped semiconductor layer and can function as a barrier layer <b>271</b>. The second layer <b>372</b> includes N-polar gallium nitride (GaN) is deposited on the layer <b>371</b>. The layer <b>372</b>, which functions as N-polar layer <b>272</b>, can be unintentionally doped at a level less than 1&#xd7;10<sup>15 </sup>cm-3. In one embodiment thickness <b>392</b> of the layer <b>372</b> is set as 20 nm. The layers <b>371</b> and <b>372</b> form a heterostructure for generation of the 2DEG channel.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A layer <b>373</b> is a depletion layer includes AlN is deposited on top of the layer <b>372</b>. The layer <b>373</b> is typically thin and is remained undoped. The purpose of this layer is to deplete the 2DEG underneath the gate when no bias is applied to the device and enable the E-mode operation. The fourth layer <b>374</b> is a dielectric layer that can, e.g., include of silicon nitride (SiN), and is formed on the top of the surface AlN layer <b>373</b>. This layer serves as a passivation layer to reduce current dispersion in GaN HEMT and improve device power performance. The layer <b>373</b> along with the layer <b>374</b> is made thin enough to allow the surface inversion carrier channel development as the positive gate bias applied. In various embodiments, the layer <b>374</b> includes high-k material, which further allows reducing the thickness of that layer. In one embodiment, the thickness <b>393</b> of the layer <b>373</b> is 2 nm, the thickness <b>391</b> of the layer <b>371</b> and the thickness <b>394</b> of the layer <b>374</b> is 1 nm. In one variation, an atomic layer deposition is used to eliminate the gate leakage.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the N-polar GaN layer <b>372</b>, in addition to the 2DEG channel <b>310</b> close to the interface of heterojunction, the induced inversion carrier channel <b>311</b> contributes to the device on-resistance reduction. The HEMT further comprises a heavily doped source and drain layer, <b>320</b> and <b>330</b> respectively. Both layers are heavily doped with a concentration above 1&#xd7;10<sup>19 </sup>cm-3. This can be achieved either by selective silicon implantation, because the activation yield of N-polar GaN is higher than the Ga-polar one, or by source/drain molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) regrowth technology. Non-alloyed ohmic contact can be made on heavily doped source/drain layer to further reduce the access layer resistance from the contact electrode to the dual channels. Thus in one embodiment, the source and the drain form ohmic contact with the stack.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows band diagrams of the E-mode dual-channel HEMT device <b>300</b>, wherein the 2DEG is depleted beneath the gate layer at zero bias using the layer <b>373</b>. The layer <b>373</b> depletes the induced 2DEG <b>310</b> by the buried polarization barrier layer. In terms of band diagram, this layer <b>373</b> functions to lift the quantum well <b>410</b> away from the Fermi level <b>411</b> to avoid accumulation of electrons which leads to the channel formation.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows an increase in the bias of the gate in this case, the quantum well approaches the Fermi level to have 2DEG sheet with a high density <b>420</b> (more than 1&#xd7;10<sup>12 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As the applied gate bias further increases, the quantum well nears and then enters into the Fermi level. However, the further movement of the quantum well is limited when the 2DEG sheet density almost reaches the physics limit. Thus, the optimized epi-lay stricture <b>370</b> of the deuce <b>300</b> with a thin gate dielectric insulator layer (<b>373</b> and <b>374</b>) permits the gate electric field modulation on surface band.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> shows the GaN surface conduction band <b>412</b> bending due to the strong vertical electric field from the applied gate bias. This bending process is similar to the metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) surface inversion layer formation. As a positive enough voltage is applied, negative charge is built up in the GaN layer close to the surface interface. Initially this charge is due to the depletion of the semiconductor starting from the insulator-semiconductor interface. The depletion layer width further increases with increasing gate voltage, but is limited by the thickness of GaN layer. With further increase of the gate voltage, the surface conduction band <b>412</b> is bending towards the Fermi level at the interface which is consistent with the presence of a high density of electrons <b>423</b>. For N-polar GaN HEMT, this surface inversion carrier channel is separated from the 2DEG channel that is close to the bottom interface as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, other than having possible electron sheet overlap which may increase the scattering and reduced the carrier mobility for Ga-polar device.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a method <b>600</b> for designing the dual channel HEMT as described above. After the HEMT, the HEMT can be fabricated <b>640</b> accordingly. The specification of the N-polar layer <b>272</b> is selected at step <b>610</b>. In the device operation mode step <b>620</b>, polarization material, thickness for both insulator layer <b>273</b> and barrier layer <b>271</b> are determined <b>623</b> and <b>627</b> in dependence of the mode <b>623</b> or <b>625</b> of the device. Some embodiments also determine surface condition of the layers including traps and fixed charges for threshold voltage tuning.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">During the operation condition step <b>630</b>, the drain bias specification <b>650</b> is determined <b>655</b> including, but not limiting to, the selection of the drain-to-gate length, insulator layer length and insulator material.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">To breakdown voltage enhancement, the drain current specification <b>660</b> is determined <b>665</b> including, but not limiting to, the selection of the total length of the device, the length of the gate, the N-polar thickness, material and thickness of the insulator and the barrier.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The gate bias specification <b>670</b> is determined <b>675</b> including, but not limiting to, the selection of the insulator material and thickness of the insulator thickness. As discussed above, the trade-off among the device performance specification need to be made when making the selection of the device components. Some steps of the method <b>600</b> are determined using a processor.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, in one embodiment a thickness of the insulator layer is selected in dependence of a voltage applied to the gate during the operation in other words, the insulator layer can be related to the threshold voltage, which set the range of the gate voltage for the operation.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The physics for the inversion carrier channel development and bottom 2DEG channel generation are different, despite the fact that channels are created in the same layer. The threshold voltage for the 2DEG component can be tuned by the process techniques and experiences only at the state of the art. To induce sufficient inversion carrier, one embodiment induce the gate bias to reach the threshold voltage V<sub>T</sub>, which is defined as</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, a thickness of the insulator layer is a proportional function of a dielectric, constant of a material of the insulator layer. For example, a small capacitance by a large gate insulator thickness or a low dielectric constant material, or negative interface charge introduced by the process require a large applied gate bias for dual channel formation. On the other hand, an increase in metal-insulator-semiconductor capacitance or an increase in amount of positive charge can lead to the early development of the inversion carrier channel than the 2DEG, which in turn can affect the E-mode operation and cause unwanted leakage consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">To further improve the drive current, vertically scaling and optimization of GaN layer thickness are considered by some embodiments. With reduce of the GaN layer thickness shrinks, the surface inversion carrier density is not much affected, but the 2DEG density increases due to a stronger electrical field imposed by gate bias due to the reduce distance between the 2DEG and the gate electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref> shows improved output characteristics or embodiment having the GaN layer thickness scaled down to 3 nm. The maximum normalized current reaches 3.34 A/mm. This enhancement also benefits from the double heterojunction structure, the N-polar GaN layer and the layer scaling, which help to minimize the 2DEG channel overlap and reduce the carrier-to-carrier scattering. However, as GaN layer is reduced to 2 nm, the output characteristics start to degrade. The significant channel overlap as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> results in the decrease of the mobility and therefore put a restriction on the drive current as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref> where very thin GaN layer yields little improvement in output characteristics.</p>
