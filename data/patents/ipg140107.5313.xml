<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a device and a method for evaluating a condition of a chassis of a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Tires on a vehicle undergo aging, i.e., they become brittle and harder with advancing age and the tread declines with the distance traveled, so their traction properties gradually worsen without the driver noticing it. Although tread depth is easy to check, the overall condition is difficult to evaluate. Other properties of the overall chassis, such as the shock absorbers and the wheel alignment, also change slowly. They all influence road traction.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Published German patent application document DE 10 2006 028 277 A1 discloses a device and a method for curve advance warning, having a control unit connected to a memory containing map data, and ascertains a current position with the aid of positioning determination means, so that a curvature in the road is calculable on the basis of the map data for a preselectable preceding road section and a curve setpoint speed is calculable and displayable as a recommendation on the basis of the curvature and input values, preferably inputtable by an operator with the aid of input means.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides a method for evaluating a condition of a chassis of a vehicle, the vehicle having a brake control system and means for detecting trip data, the method including the following steps: combining at least one control signal of the brake control system with at least one output signal of the means for detecting trip data to obtain a combined signal; and evaluating the condition of the chassis on the basis of the combined signal.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A vehicle may be understood to be a motor vehicle, in particular a road vehicle, for example, a passenger vehicle or a truck. A chassis of the vehicle includes moving parts of the vehicle which connect the vehicle to the road surface. These moving parts include, for example, wheels, wheel suspension, suspension, shock absorbers, steering and the service brake. The condition of the vehicle relates to a functionality of the chassis as intended. A poor condition of one or more parts of the chassis may have a negative effect on the functionality of the chassis. The brake control system may be an electronic system such as an antilock braking system (ABS), a traction control system (TCS) and/or an electronic stability program (ESP). The brake control system ensures a secure road holding of the vehicle during acceleration and deceleration operations and when negotiating curves by intervening in other vehicle systems via control signals. The means for detecting trip data may be means for determining the position of the vehicle, for example, a navigation system. A navigation system enables targeted guidance to a selected location or a route, taking into account desired criteria, with the help of position determination and stored geo information. The navigation system may also ascertain trip data, for example, speed information and/or acceleration information from position information. Position information, speed information and/or acceleration information may represent output signals of the means for detection of trip data. The combining step may involve a mathematical or logical linking of signals, for example, using basic arithmetics. The combined signal is formed from this linkage or combination. In the evaluation step, the condition of the chassis is inferred with the aid of suitable algorithms or devices and according to predefined regulation of the combined signal.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention also provides a device for evaluating a condition of a chassis of a vehicle in which the device has data of a brake control system and means for detecting trip data, the device including the following features: a unit for combining at least one control signal of the brake control system with at least one output signal of the means for detecting trip data to obtain a combined signal; and a unit for evaluating the condition of the chassis on the basis of the combined signal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the device need not include the brake control system and/or the means for detecting trip data, but instead data from units already installed in the vehicle may be used further for the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention thus provides a device or a chassis condition detection unit, which is designed to perform and execute the steps of the method according to the present invention. In particular the device or the chassis condition detection unit may have equipment designed to execute one step each of one of the methods. The object on which the present invention is based may be achieved rapidly and efficiently through this embodiment variant of the present invention in the form of a device or a chassis condition detection unit.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the present case, a device or a chassis condition detection unit may be understood to be an electric unit, which processes the sensor signals and outputs control or chassis condition detection signals as a function thereof. The device or the chassis condition detection unit may have an interface, which may be designed as hardware and/or software. In the case of hardware, the interfaces may be part of a so-called system ASIC, for example, which includes a wide variety of functions of the device or the control unit. However, it is also possible for the interfaces to be their own integrated circuits or be made up at least partially of discrete components. In the case of software, the interfaces may be software modules, which are present, for example, on a microcontroller in addition to other software modules.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A computer program product having program code, which is stored on a machine-readable carrier, such as a semiconductor memory, a hard drive memory or an optical memory, and is used to perform one of the methods according to the present invention when the program is executed on a device or a chassis condition detection unit is also advantageous.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention is based on the finding that an evaluation of the condition of the tires and chassis makes it possible to warn the driver of a slow deterioration of the tire condition or the chassis properties. Analyzing the signals of electronic brake control systems via the intervention of these systems is put in relation to the assumed road condition and thus the assumed road traction, the speed of the vehicle and the course of the road in order to evaluate the condition of the tires.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">On the one hand, this evaluation may be performed when negotiating curves, for example, where the navigation system or the means for detecting trip data, taking into account all the available information, for example, the curve radius, moisture or wetness, a recommended maximum speed, which, if maintained with a faultlessly functioning chassis, for example, with new tires, should not result in an intervention in the electronic brake control systems. If the electronic brake control systems nevertheless respond, this may indicate a poor condition of the tires. This relationship is evaluated according to one specific embodiment of the present invention in order to be able to draw conclusions about the condition of the chassis.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">On the other hand, this evaluation may be performed during acceleration/deceleration of the vehicle. Obtained acceleration or deceleration values may also be used for an evaluation. For example, frequent response of the electronic brake control systems when the road is assumed to be dry and accelerations/decelerations are low may also indicate tire wear.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The advantages of the present invention include the fact that information may be analyzed in a manner that would not be possible with the individual systems due to the cross-linking of the electronic brake control system and the navigation system. The driver is warned if the tire condition is becoming progressively worse and may have the tires checked by a specialist, for example. Furthermore, it is advantageous to initially collect the individual results in a statistics module and to issue a warning only when there is an accumulation of events. Prompt correction of any chassis problems, for example, replacing the tires, as is made possible in a more reliable and safe manner according to one specific embodiment of the present invention, increases traffic safety.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to one specific embodiment, in the step of combining, data representing at least one item of position information, speed information and/or acceleration information from a navigation system may be used as the output signal of the means for detecting data, and data originating from an antilock braking system (ABS), a traction control system (TCS) and/or an electronic stability program (ESP) may also be used as the control signal of the brake control system. This offers the advantage that data present anyway in a vehicle equipped with a brake control system and a navigation system are used and may be made accessible, i.e., usable, with no problem.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to one specific embodiment, in the step of combining and/or evaluating, vehicle-specific and/or chassis-specific information and/or information about the surroundings transmitted from at least one other vehicle may also be used. Vehicle-specific and/or chassis-specific information may be understood to refer to vehicle-specific and/or chassis-specific properties, for example, tire-specific properties. In concrete terms, this may be manufacturer's information. The ambient information may include information about a road condition due to the weather, for example. This offers the advantage that taking into account vehicle-specific and tire-specific properties (manufacturer's information) may improve the result of the evaluation. Vehicles may exchange empirical values about the road condition by communicating from one vehicle to another, so-called car-to-car communication. If most or all vehicles in the immediate vicinity are reporting that roads are not slick, but the electronic brake control systems are responding too frequently in one's own vehicle for the speed of the vehicle or the braking deceleration, this may indicate a poor tire condition. Thus the condition of the chassis may be evaluated even more reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to one specific embodiment, the steps of combining and evaluating may be performed separately for at least two wheels of the vehicle. At least two wheels of the vehicle may receive different brake trigger signals, so that the different trigger signals may also be used for the separate evaluation of the condition of the chassis. For example, at least one left wheel and one right wheel, at least one front wheel and at least one rear wheel or all wheels may be considered separately from one another in order to be able to determine the condition of the chassis on the whole. This has the advantage that chassis parts may also be evaluated with regard to their condition, even if they have not undergone a separate evaluation procedure. Poor road traction may also be an indication of defective shock absorbers or a misalignment of the wheels of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to one specific embodiment, this method includes an additional step of collecting the evaluated conditions of the chassis in a statistics module and another step of statistical analysis-of the collected evaluated conditions. A statistics module may be understood to be a memory element, in which the evaluated conditions may be stored as data. It is appropriate here to collect only negatively evaluated conditions of the chassis, which indicate a suboptimal or worsened condition of the chassis. A suitable program for statistical analysis may access the data stored in the statistics module. In the statistical analysis, it is possible to check for exceeding or falling below a threshold value, for example, which is based on a frequency of occurrence of negatively evaluated conditions within a defined period of time. This offers the advantage that it creates a data collection which permits even more reliable conclusions about the actual condition of the vehicle and over a longer period of time than is possible on the basis of a single evaluated condition.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to one specific embodiment, the method may have an additional step of outputting a warning signal when the evaluated condition of the chassis or information derived therefrom meets a warning criterion. The output of a warning signal may be visual and/or acoustic for an occupant of a vehicle, for example. Information derived from the evaluated condition of the chassis may indicate whether the chassis as a whole or individual parts thereof is in a good or poor condition. The warning criterion may be met on exceeding a threshold value, which is based on a frequency of occurrence of negatively evaluated conditions within a defined period of time. This offers the advantage that vehicle occupants may be informed about a condition of the chassis and then the driver may suitably adjust his driving style.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to one specific embodiment, the method may include an additional step of storing the evaluated condition of the chassis or information derived therefrom in a memory for a vehicle inspection. A memory for a vehicle inspection may be understood to be an error memory, which may be read out during a vehicle inspection using manufacturer-specific equipment. This offers the advantage that by feeding data into the error memory of the vehicle, with appropriate vehicle cross-linking, the condition of the chassis may be analyzed during an inspection by the workshop. An analysis may also be performed on each wheel/shock absorber and the results entered into the error memory. If messages about the condition of the chassis are thus stored in the error memory and these messages are indicative of a poor condition, then the chassis or parts thereof may be checked, adjusted, repaired or replaced. There is thus a definitely reduced risk of overlooking safety-relevant damage conditions of the chassis.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to one specific embodiment, in a method for curve advance warning for a vehicle, an evaluated condition of a chassis of a vehicle may be used in the method according to the present invention to determine a maximum or recommended curve speed. Modern navigation systems offer the driver a curve advance warning function, a so-called curve alarm. In one curve advance warning method for a vehicle, a maximum drivable speed for the given curve is calculated based on the course of the digitized road in front of the vehicle, in particular a curve radius of a given curve, and assumed road. traction, in particular the coefficient of friction, and when this speed is exceeded, a warning is issued. In addition, the assumed road traction is determined better and more accurately by analyzing additional sensors such as rain sensors and outside thermometers and analyzing the signals of electronic brake control systems (ABS, TCS, ESP). The ascertained tire condition may in turn be used to determine the road traction and may thus be incorporated in the curve alarm. This offers the advantage that an important additional parameter is used with the evaluated condition of the chassis, permitting a safe maximum curve speed to be ascertained.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In vehicle <b>100</b> having four wheels <b>110</b>, navigation system <b>120</b> and brake control system <b>130</b> are situated, with which device <b>140</b> for evaluating a condition of a chassis (for the sake of simplicity, only four wheels <b>110</b> of the chassis are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of a vehicle is connected. Device <b>140</b> has combination unit <b>150</b> and evaluation unit <b>155</b>.

Warning output unit <b>180</b> and error memory <b>190</b> of vehicle <b>100</b> are connected to device <b>140</b> and statistics module <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">On the one hand, brake control system <b>130</b> is connected to four wheels <b>110</b> of vehicle <b>100</b>. Each of four wheels <b>110</b>, in particular a brake system of each wheel <b>110</b>, is connected to brake control system <b>130</b>. Brake control system <b>130</b> includes, for example, an antilock braking system (ABS), a traction control system (TCS) and/or an electronic stability program (ESP). Brake control system <b>130</b> interacts with four wheels <b>110</b> in a manner which is known in the field. On the other hand, brake control system <b>130</b> is connected to device <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">On the one hand, navigation system <b>120</b> is connected to an antenna (shown at the left next to navigation system <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Navigation system <b>120</b> is designed, for example, to be satellite- or radio-supported, as is known in the field. A navigation system <b>120</b>, which is widely used in the market, is based on GPS (global positioning system). The antenna of navigation system <b>120</b> is thus, for example, a GPS or radio transceiver. On the other hand, navigation system <b>120</b> is connected to device <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Device <b>140</b> for evaluating the condition of a chassis of a vehicle is connected to navigation system <b>120</b> and brake control system <b>130</b> as well as statistics module <b>160</b>, warning output unit <b>180</b> and error memory <b>190</b>. Combining unit <b>150</b> and evaluation unit <b>155</b> are part of device <b>140</b>. Units <b>150</b>, <b>155</b> of device <b>140</b> are connected to one another, and device <b>140</b> and the systems modules and units connected to it are interconnected so that a method according to the present invention for evaluating a condition of a chassis of a vehicle is executable.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Statistics module <b>160</b> has collecting unit <b>170</b> and analysis unit <b>175</b>. Collecting unit <b>170</b> is present in the form of a memory, for example. Analysis unit <b>175</b> is connected to collecting unit <b>170</b> and accesses stored content of collecting unit <b>170</b> to analyze same statistically. Statistics module <b>160</b> is connected to device <b>140</b>, warning output unit <b>180</b> and error memory <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Warning output unit <b>180</b> is connected to device <b>140</b> and statistics module <b>160</b>. Warning output unit <b>180</b> is, for example, a display and/or a loudspeaker, which is/are part of a dashboard of vehicle <b>100</b>. The display includes here, for example, a warning light or a display field on the dashboard, on a navigation unit or on a center console, which is designed for outputting an alphanumeric message.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Error memory <b>190</b> of vehicle <b>100</b> is connected to device <b>140</b> and statistics module <b>160</b>. Error messages of various systems and modules of vehicle <b>100</b> are storable in error memory <b>190</b>. During a repair or a regular inspection of vehicle <b>100</b>, error memory <b>190</b> may be read out to facilitate troubleshooting or error diagnosis and subsequent fault repair.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The functioning of device <b>140</b> for evaluating a condition of a chassis in vehicle <b>100</b> is explained below according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Navigation system <b>120</b> calculates position information for vehicle <b>100</b> on a digital road map from input signals from the antenna and additional input signals in the form of data from other vehicle sensors (not shown). These other vehicle sensors may be, for example, sensor elements such as a gyrometer or an acceleration sensor in the navigation unit. Information about a speed and an acceleration of vehicle <b>100</b> may be derived from position information determined in chronological succession. Furthermore, in the exemplary embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the navigation system also calculates a recommended maximum curve speed for a given curve. Navigation system <b>120</b> outputs the output signals, for example, the above-mentioned position information, speed information, acceleration information and/or curve speed information to device <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Brake control system <b>130</b> is communicatively linked to the brake system of each wheel <b>110</b> of vehicle <b>100</b>. The type and manner of interaction of brake control system <b>130</b> with the brake systems of wheels <b>110</b> are sufficiently well known to those skilled in the art in this field and therefore will not be discussed further here. Brake control system <b>130</b> delivers an output signal to device <b>140</b> when there is an intervention of brake control system <b>130</b> into the driving operation.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Device <b>140</b> thus receives input signals from navigation system <b>120</b> and brake control system <b>130</b>. Furthermore, device <b>140</b> may also use additional data as the calculation basis, for example, vehicle-specific and/or chassis-specific properties in the form of manufacturer's specifications as well as empirical values about the road condition transmitted from other vehicles. For example, signals from vehicle sensors may be used as means for detecting trip data, these means having suitable sensor elements, for example, a rain sensor for detecting wetness or moisture. An outside thermometer may also be provided as a vehicle sensor which detects data with regard to an outside temperature. These signals of the vehicle sensors may also supply trip data which are combined in the device with the signals of the brake control system. The input signals of device <b>140</b> are initially processed in combining unit <b>150</b>. The input signals are combined here in the sense of a logic combination or using basic arithmetics. Combining unit <b>150</b> generates a combine signal from the input signals. Combining unit <b>150</b> then outputs this combined signal to evaluation unit <b>155</b>. Evaluating unit <b>155</b> draws conclusions about the condition of the chassis of vehicle <b>100</b> from the condition of the combined signal.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A condition of the combined signal may refer to whether or not the speed at which vehicle <b>100</b> is currently being driven is higher than the recommended maximum curve speed. Assuming the chassis is in a good condition, this should not result in a response or intervention of electronic brake control system <b>130</b> if the speed currently being driven is no higher than the recommended maximum curve speed. If brake control system <b>130</b> nevertheless responds, this suggests a poor condition of the chassis. The condition of the combined signal may also refer to whether there is a response of brake control system <b>130</b> at the positive or negative acceleration currently achieved. If, assuming a dry road condition and a low acceleration, brake control system <b>130</b> nevertheless responds or even responds frequently, for example, this indicates a poor condition of the chassis.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">After evaluating unit <b>155</b> has evaluated and processed the combined signal, there are various options for how to proceed further. The evaluated combined signal may be output directly to warning output unit <b>180</b> in the event an ascertained poor condition of the chassis is output by device <b>140</b> through which vehicle occupants are warned about a poor condition of the chassis. In the case of an ascertained poor condition of the chassis, the evaluated combined signal may be sent from device <b>140</b> to error memory <b>190</b>, from which the poor condition of the chassis may then be read out during an inspection of vehicle <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">However, it appears to be reasonable to initially collect the individual results in statistics module <b>160</b> first in the form of the evaluated combined signals, which indicate a poor condition of the chassis and to output a warning via warning output unit <b>180</b> only when there has been an accumulation of events and/or to prompt an entry into error memory <b>190</b>. To do so, the evaluated combined signals are output by device <b>140</b> to statistics module <b>160</b>. The evaluated combined signals are stored in statistics module <b>160</b> in collecting unit <b>170</b>. Analysis unit <b>175</b> performs a statistical analysis on the stored evaluated combined signals. If the statistical analysis indicates an accumulation of events above a predefined threshold value, statistics module <b>160</b> outputs a statistically analyzed signal based on the stored evaluated combined signals, to warning output unit <b>180</b> and/or to error memory <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is also conceivable to send the evaluated condition of the chassis of vehicle <b>100</b> to navigation system <b>120</b> either from device <b>140</b> or from statistics module <b>160</b>. The evaluated condition of the chassis may be used here for a more accurate ascertainment of the recommended maximum curve speed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a flow chart of a method <b>200</b> for evaluating a condition of a chassis of a vehicle according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In a step <b>210</b>, at least one control signal of a brake control system is combined with at least one output signal of a navigation system to obtain a combined signal. In combining step <b>210</b>, for example, data representing at least one item of position information, speed information and/or acceleration information are used as the output signal of the navigation system. Furthermore, in step <b>210</b> of combining data originating from an antilock braking system (ABS), a traction control system (TCS) and/or an electronic stability program (ESP) may be used as the control signal of the brake control system.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a step <b>220</b>, the condition of the chassis is evaluated based on the combined signal. In addition, in combining step <b>210</b> and/or evaluation step <b>220</b>, for example, vehicle-specific and/or chassis-specific information and/or information about the surroundings transmitted from at least one other vehicle is/are used. In a step <b>230</b>, evaluated conditions of the chassis are collected in a statistics module. In a step <b>240</b>, the collected evaluated conditions are analyzed statistically. In a step <b>250</b>, a warning signal is output when the evaluated condition of the chassis or information derived therefrom meets a warning criterion. In a step <b>260</b>, the evaluated condition of the chassis or information derived therefrom is stored in a memory for a vehicle inspection.</p>
