<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Electric vehicle <b>110</b> can be taken to charging station <b>105</b> for charging the one or more batteries. Charging station <b>105</b> can also be used to store electric vehicle <b>110</b> and/or maintain a charge on the one or more batteries of electric vehicle <b>110</b>. Charging station <b>105</b> can be a stall, parking spot, or other area in which electric vehicle <b>110</b> can be taken to re-charge the one or more batteries of electric vehicle <b>110</b>. For example, charging station <b>105</b> may be a parking spot located in a parking lot.

In an alternative embodiment, a separate control unit may be utilized to control the interaction of components in charging station <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The information identified by transaction unit <b>150</b> and regarding electric vehicle <b>110</b> can include a type of battery(s) included in electric vehicle <b>110</b>, a condition or health of the battery(s) in electric vehicle <b>110</b>, any temperature restrictions regarding the battery(s) in electric vehicle <b>110</b>, any charging rate restrictions for the battery(s) in electric vehicle <b>110</b>, and/or an amount of charge residing on the battery(s) in electric vehicle <b>110</b>. This information can be received by analyzing the battery(s) through vehicle interface <b>145</b>, from a website of a manufacturer of electric vehicle <b>110</b>, from stored literature regarding electric vehicle <b>110</b>, from inputs received through the user interface, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The information identified by transactional unit <b>150</b> can also include a distance that the owner of electric vehicle <b>110</b> plans to drive prior to recharging, a destination of the driver, a desired arrival time to the destination, a route to the destination, etc. The distance, destination, desired arrival time, and/or route can be used to determine how much charge is needed by the electric battery and/or a charging schedule for the battery. The information can also include an amount of time that the owner can allow electric vehicle <b>110</b> to charge, which can be used to determine a rate at which the battery is charged. The information can further include whether the owner grants the system permission to use any stored power in the battery(s) of electric vehicle <b>110</b>. Transactional unit <b>150</b> can use the identified information to determine a voltage at which to charge the battery(s), a rate at which to charge the battery(s), and an amount of payment due for charging the batteries. Transactional unit <b>150</b> can also use the identified information and the ambient temperature to determine whether the battery(s) of electric vehicle <b>110</b> should be heated or cooled during charging. As known to those of skill in the art, charging or discharging an electric car battery at temperatures of 0 degrees Fahrenheit (F) and below can severely impact battery lifetime. As such, it may be desirable to keep the battery(s) warm when charging at low temperatures. It is also well known that I<sup>2</sup>*R heating can occur when charging a battery, where I is the charging current and R is the internal resistance of the battery. As such, it may be desirable to keep the battery(s) cool when charging at high temperatures. If it is determined that climate control is desirable, transactional unit <b>150</b> can cause waste heat unit <b>155</b> to heat the battery(s) or cooling unit <b>160</b> to cool the battery(s).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Waste heat unit <b>155</b> can utilize waste heat from fuel cell system <b>125</b> to heat at least the battery(s) of electric vehicle <b>110</b>. The waste heat can be obtained from an anode or cathode exhaust system of fuel cell system <b>125</b>, from heat radiated off the fuel cells of fuel cell system <b>125</b>, etc. In one embodiment, waste heat unit <b>155</b> can include one or more fans or blowers to circulate the waste heat under electric vehicle <b>110</b> to keep the battery(s) warm. Alternatively, the waste heat can be directed under electric vehicle <b>110</b> by circulating heated fluid in the pavement or other surface upon which electric vehicle <b>110</b> is parked. Brush curtains, walls, a ceiling, and/or any other structure of charging station <b>105</b> can be used to prevent heat loss and to help keep electric vehicle <b>110</b> warm. In one embodiment, the waste heat may also be delivered via the heating/cooling system of electric vehicle <b>110</b>. In such an embodiment, the waste heat can be delivered to electric vehicle <b>110</b> via heated air and the blowers/pumps of the heating/cooling system can be activated by waste heat unit <b>155</b> to circulate the heated air throughout electric vehicle <b>110</b>. If electric vehicle <b>110</b> includes a flow battery or other liquid electrolyte battery, waste heat unit <b>155</b> can pump the liquid electrolyte from the battery, place the liquid electrolyte into contact with the waste heat, and circulate the heated liquid electrolyte back into the battery.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Waste heat unit <b>155</b> can also be configured to warm up electric vehicle <b>110</b> at a predetermined time. For example, charging station <b>105</b> may be in a parking lot where an owner of electric vehicle <b>110</b> works. Transactional unit <b>150</b> may know (based on user input or pattern recognition) that the owner goes out for lunch at 12:00 pm every day and gets done with work at 5:00 pm every day. As such, transactional unit <b>150</b> can cause waste heat unit <b>155</b> to heat electric vehicle <b>110</b> several minutes (i.e., 5-10 minutes) prior to 12:00 pm and 5:00 pm every day such that electric vehicle <b>110</b> is warm when the owner gets behind the wheel. Similarly, charging station <b>105</b> may be located at a grocery store parking lot. Transaction unit <b>150</b> and/or waste heat unit <b>155</b> can receive checkout information from a checkout system of the grocery store. As such, waste heat unit <b>155</b> can be used to heat electric vehicle <b>110</b> upon an indication that the owner is at the checkout register. The determination regarding whether or how much to heat electric vehicle <b>110</b> can also be based at least in part on the ambient outside temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Cooling unit <b>160</b> can be used by transactional unit <b>150</b> to keep the battery(s) of electric vehicle cool if the ambient temperature is high. In one embodiment, cooling unit <b>160</b> can directly operate battery cooling fans of electric vehicle <b>110</b> to improve charging conditions. Cooling unit <b>160</b> can also use one or more external fans and/or blowers to circulate air within the battery compartment to aid in cooling. If electric vehicle <b>110</b> includes an electric type air conditioning (A/C) unit, cooling unit <b>160</b> can directly operate the A/C system during charging to aid in cooling and/or to keep the owner of electric vehicle <b>110</b> comfortable if he/she remains in electric vehicle <b>110</b> during charging. Alternatively, fuel cell generator system <b>100</b> may generate cool air in large scale using an A/C or other cooling unit. The cool air could be blown directly onto and/or into electric vehicle <b>110</b> using a coaxial wiring connection. As an example, a center (or inside portion) of the coaxial wiring connection can include wiring for electrically connecting cooling unit <b>160</b> to the A/C unit or other component of electric vehicle <b>110</b>, and an outside portion (or periphery) of the coaxial wiring connection can be a tube for conveying cool air to electric vehicle <b>110</b>. Alternatively, any other configuration may be used to convey the cool air or other cooled fluid. Cooling unit <b>160</b> can also be used to cool electric vehicle <b>110</b> at a predetermined time (i.e., just before the owner is ready to leave work for the day, upon an indication that the owner is at the checkout register of a store, etc.)</p>
