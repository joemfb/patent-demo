<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Disclosed is a liquid crystal display device, a fabricating method, and a driving method thereof that includes at least one integrated photosensor that senses external light illumination on the liquid crystal display device. A sensing signal from the at least one photosensors are converted into a digital signal that is stored to represent an external illumination distribution. The liquid crystal display device includes a backlight that has a plurality of light sources that may be independently driven. A controller generates a control signal that independently drives the light sources in a manner corresponding to the illumination distribution. In doing so, areas of the liquid crystal display device may be provided with a greater amount of light from a corresponding light source so that externally illuminated areas of the liquid crystal display device do not suffer from reduced contrast.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. P2006-056744 filed in Korea on Jun. 23, 2006, which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to a liquid crystal display device. More particularly, the invention relates to a liquid crystal display device, a fabricating method, and a driving method thereof that improve visibility and reduce power consumption as well as reduce fabricating costs.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, a liquid crystal display device LCD controls light transmittance of liquid crystal cells in accordance with video signals to display a picture. Such an LCD implementation typically includes an active matrix type LCD having a switching device for each cell. Such LCD display devices are used as computer monitors, office equipment, cellular phones and the like. The switching device for the active matrix LCD mainly employs an array of thin film transistors (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;TFTs&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a related art LCD driving apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the related art LCD driving apparatus includes a liquid crystal display panel <b>52</b> having m&#xd7;n liquid crystal cells Clc arranged in a matrix type, m data lines D<b>1</b> to Dm and n gate lines G<b>1</b> to Gn crossing each other and thin film transistors TFT provided at the crossings, a data driver <b>64</b> for applying data signals to the data lines D<b>1</b> to Dm of the liquid crystal display panel <b>52</b>, a gate driver <b>66</b> for applying scanning signals to the gate lines G<b>1</b> and Gn, a gamma voltage supplier <b>68</b> for supplying the data driver <b>64</b> with gamma voltages, a timing controller <b>60</b> for controlling the data driver <b>64</b> and the gate driver <b>66</b> using synchronizing signals from a system <b>70</b>, a direct current to direct current converter <b>74</b> (hereinafter a &#x201c;DC/DC converter&#x201d;) for generating voltages supplied to the liquid crystal display panel <b>52</b> using a voltage from a power supply <b>62</b>, and an inverter <b>76</b> for driving a back light <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The system <b>70</b> applies vertical/horizontal synchronizing signals Vsync and Hsync, clock signals DCLK, a data enable signal DE, and R, G and B data signals to the timing controller <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The liquid crystal display panel <b>52</b> includes a plurality of liquid crystal cells Clc arranged in a matrix at the crossings of the data lines D<b>1</b> to Dm and the gate lines G<b>1</b> to Gn. The thin film transistor TFT provided at each liquid crystal cell Clc applies a data signal from a corresponding data line D<b>1</b> to Dm to the liquid crystal cell Clc in response to a scanning signal from the gate line G. Further, each liquid crystal cell Clc is provided with a storage capacitor Cst. The storage capacitor Cst is provided between a pixel electrode of the liquid crystal cell Clc and a pre-stage gate line, or between the pixel electrode of the liquid crystal cell Clc and a common electrode line, to thereby maintain a constant voltage on the liquid crystal cell Clc.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The gamma voltage supplier <b>68</b> applies a plurality of gamma voltages to the data driver <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The data driver <b>64</b> converts R, G, and B digital video data into analog gamma voltages (i.e., data signals) corresponding to gray level values in response to a control signal CS from the timing controller <b>60</b>, and applies the analog gamma voltages to the data lines D<b>1</b> to Dm.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The gate driver <b>66</b> sequentially applies a scanning pulse to the gate lines G<b>1</b> to Gn in response to a control signal CS from the timing controller <b>60</b> to thereby select horizontal lines of the liquid crystal display panel <b>52</b> supplied with the data signals from data driver <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The timing controller <b>60</b> generates the control signals CS for controlling the gate driver <b>66</b> and the data driver <b>64</b> using the vertical/horizontal synchronizing signals Vsync and Hsync and the clock signal DCLK input from the system <b>70</b>. Herein, the control signal CS for controlling the gate driver <b>66</b> includes a gate start pulse GSP, a gate shift clock GSC and a gate output enable signal GOE, etc. Further, the control signal CS for controlling the data driver <b>64</b> includes a source start pulse SSP, a source shift clock SSC, a source output enable signal SOE, and a polarity signal POL, etc. The timing controller <b>60</b> re-aligns the R, D and B data from the system <b>70</b> to apply them to the data driver <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The DC/DC converter <b>74</b> boosts or drops a 3.3V input voltage from the power supply <b>62</b> to generate a voltage supplied to the liquid crystal display panel <b>52</b>. Such a Dc/DC converter <b>72</b> generates a gamma reference voltage, a gate high voltage VGH, a gate low voltage VGL and a common voltage Vcom, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The inverter <b>76</b> drives the backlight <b>78</b> with the aid of a driving voltage Vin supplied from any one of the power supply <b>62</b> and the system <b>70</b>. The backlight <b>78</b> is controlled by the inverter <b>76</b> to thereby generate a light and illuminate the liquid crystal display panel <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A problem associated with the related art is that light output from the backlight <b>78</b> is constant. As such, if ambient light is greater than the panel brightness, panel visibility is reduced. Conversely, if the ambient light is low, then the panel may be overly bright in comparison. This excessive panel brightness in low ambient light conditions leads to unnecessary and excessive power consumption To solve this problem, a technique that senses an external light using a photosensor such as a photodiode, etc., and controls brightness of the backlight <b>78</b> by a user's operation in accordance with the photosensor output has been suggested. However, the addition of a separate photosensor increases assembly costs of the LCD panel.</p>

Such related art solutions cannot selectively increase brightness of the backlight at a specific area of the liquid crystal display panel <b>52</b>. Further, the external light <b>53</b> that illuminates a portion of the liquid crystal display panel <b>52</b> creates a problem in that the contrast ratio of the illuminated area (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;illumination area&#x201d;) P<b>1</b>, which is illuminated by the external light <b>53</b>, is reduced relative to the area (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;non-illumination area&#x201d;) P<b>2</b>, which is not illuminated the external light <b>53</b>.</p>

The inverter controller <b>220</b> controls the first to the k(th) inverter circuit portions <b>210</b><i>a </i>to <b>210</b><i>k </i>using the first to the K(th) brightness control signals D<b>1</b> to Dk from the timing controller <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The backlight driver <b>210</b> independently drives the light sources depending upon a illumination distribution by the first to the K(th) brightness control signals D<b>1</b> to Dk from the timing controller <b>160</b>. In other words, the inverter controller <b>220</b> of the backlight driver <b>210</b> supplies more high-level voltage to light sources positioned at an area that is overlapped with the illumination area P<b>1</b> illuminated by external light to thereby supply more light to the illumination area of the liquid crystal display panel <b>152</b>. In doing so, it becomes possible to increase the contrast ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the liquid crystal display device having such a structure, since a photosensor is integrated within the liquid crystal display panel <b>152</b>, it is not necessary to add an external photosensor. Thus, cost is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Furthermore, the liquid crystal display device includes light sources <b>212</b><i>a</i>-<b>212</b><i>k </i>that are independently capable of being driven and are arranged in a matrix formation at the rear side of the liquid crystal display panel <b>152</b> to thereby supply a light having a different brightness depending upon the illumination distribution of the liquid crystal display panel <b>152</b>. Accordingly, brightness of the light sources <b>212</b><i>a</i>-<b>212</b><i>k </i>corresponding to the illumination area P<b>1</b> of the liquid crystal display panel <b>152</b> can be increased to thereby prevent a contrast ratio deterioration of the illumination area P<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">An exemplary process for driving the light sources <b>212</b><i>a</i>-<b>212</b><i>k</i>, based on a light sensing process according to the present invention will be described in detail as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, if a first driving voltage Vdrv (for example, a voltage of approximately 10V) is applied to the source electrode <b>110</b><i>b </i>of the sensor TFT <b>140</b>, a second driving voltage Vbias (for example, a voltage of approximately &#x2212;5V) is applied to the gate electrode <b>108</b><i>b </i>of the sensor TFT <b>140</b> and an external light is irradiated into a portion area of the liquid crystal display panel <b>152</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Then the irradiated light impinging on the liquid crystal panel is sensed in the active layer <b>114</b><i>b </i>of the sensor TFT <b>140</b> located at the illumination area P<b>1</b>. Accordingly, a photocurrent, which flows from the source electrode <b>110</b><i>b </i>of the sensor TFT <b>140</b> to the drain electrode <b>112</b><i>b </i>by way of a channel is provided. The photocurrent flows from the drain electrode <b>112</b><i>b </i>of the sensor TFT <b>140</b> forward the second storage electrode <b>182</b>. Accordingly, a sensing voltage corresponding to the photocurrent is charged into the second storage capacitor <b>180</b> including the first sub-capacitor <b>180</b><i>a</i>, which includes the second driving voltage supply line <b>171</b> and the second storage electrode <b>182</b>; the second sub-capacitor <b>180</b><i>b</i>, which includes the second storage electrode <b>182</b> and the first driving voltage supply line <b>152</b>; and the third sub-capacitor, <b>180</b><i>c</i>, which includes the second storage electrode <b>182</b> and the second transparent electrode pattern <b>156</b>. Thus, the sensing voltage charged into the second storage capacitor <b>180</b> is transmitted to the read-out integrated circuit portion <b>202</b> by way of the second TFT <b>170</b> and the read-out line <b>204</b></p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Accordingly, an analog voltage sensed at the read-out integrated circuit portion <b>202</b> is converted, via the ADC <b>220</b>, into a digital signal, which is supplied to the timing controller <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The timing controller <b>160</b> supplies the digital signal from the ADC <b>220</b> to the memory <b>206</b>, and the memory <b>206</b> stores an illumination distribution data. The illumination distribution data enables the distinguishing of the illumination area P<b>1</b> from the non-illumination area P<b>2</b>. The illumination area P<b>1</b> corresponds to the location of sensor TFTs <b>140</b> that sensed external light, and the non-illumination area P<b>2</b> corresponds to the locations of sensor TFTs <b>140</b> that did not sense external light.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a illumination distribution data having an information on the non-illumination area P<b>2</b> and the illumination area P<b>1</b> may be stored in the form of a digital value of &#x201c;0&#x201d; and a digital value of &#x201c;1&#x201d; into the memory <b>206</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The illumination distribution data in the memory <b>206</b> is supplied to the timing controller <b>160</b> and the timing controller <b>160</b> generates the brightness control signal D<b>1</b> to Dk using the illumination distribution data from the memory <b>206</b>, and supplies the brightness control signal D<b>1</b> to Dk to the backlight driver <b>210</b>. The backlight driver <b>210</b> independently controls the amount of light from each of the plurality of light sources of the backlight <b>212</b> using the brightness control signal D<b>1</b> to Dk.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">A case where the liquid crystal display panel is divided into four unit areas, A, B, C and D, with one light source corresponding to each of these unit areas, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, will be described as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The inverter controller <b>220</b> of the backlight driver <b>210</b> is supplied with the first to fourth control signals D<b>1</b> to D<b>4</b> from the timing controller <b>160</b> to control a first to a fourth inverter circuit portion <b>210</b><i>a </i>to <b>210</b><i>d</i>. In other words, the inverter controller <b>220</b> supplies a pulse with modulated (PWM) or a pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) control signal to each respective inverter circuit <b>210</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>. In doing so, the first brightness control signal D<b>1</b> is supplied to the first inverter circuit portion <b>210</b><i>a</i>; the second brightness control signal D<b>2</b> is supplied to the second inverter circuit portion <b>210</b><i>b</i>; the third brightness control signal D<b>3</b> is supplied to the third inverter circuit portion <b>210</b><i>c</i>; and the fourth brightness control signal D<b>1</b> is supplied to the fourth inverter circuit portion <b>210</b><i>d</i>. The first inverter circuit portion <b>210</b><i>a </i>drives the first light source <b>212</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the first area A of the liquid crystal display panel <b>152</b>; the second inverter circuit portion <b>210</b><i>b </i>drives the second light source <b>212</b><i>b </i>corresponding to the second area B of the liquid crystal display panel <b>152</b>, the third inverter circuit portion <b>210</b><i>c </i>drives the third light source <b>212</b><i>c </i>corresponding to the third area C of the liquid crystal display panel <b>152</b>; and the fourth inverter circuit portion <b>210</b><i>d </i>drives the fourth light source <b>212</b><i>d </i>corresponding to the fourth area D of the liquid crystal display panel <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">If the second area B is the illumination area P<b>1</b>, then the second inverter circuit portion <b>210</b><i>b </i>supplies a driving voltage (or a driving current) corresponding to the second brightness control signal D<b>2</b> from the timing controller <b>160</b> to the second light source <b>212</b><i>b</i>, so that the second light source <b>212</b><i>b </i>supplies a light for compensating a deterioration of the contrast ratio reduced by the illumination of the second area B of the liquid crystal display panel <b>152</b>. As a result, a deterioration of the contrast ratio of the illumination area P<b>1</b> at the liquid crystal display panel <b>152</b> can be reduced.</p>
